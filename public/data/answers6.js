Whatever has an image on it, it is haraam for adults to wear \r\n    it, so it is also haraam for children to wear it. This is the answer. What \r\n    the Muslims should do is to boycott these clothes and shoes, so that the \r\n    evildoers will have no means of reaching us in this matter.

But after that he hoped [?} that Allaah would \r\n    change that, so he started lifting his face towards the heavens, looking for \r\n    Jibreel to come down with the Revelation telling him to turn towards the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&rsquo;s) \r\n    face towards the heaven.

In that case he should pray no matter which direction he is \r\n    facing. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on foot \r\n    or riding.

And the phrase &ldquo;<i>And when you are in safety, \r\n    offer the Salaah (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew \r\n    not (before)<\/i>&rdquo; indicates that whatever part of the prayer a person \r\n    omitted because of fear, there is no sin on him because of that &ndash; and that \r\n    includes facing towards the qiblah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is also indicated by the two verses quoted above, and \r\n    the hadeeth in which it says that obligations are connected to one&rsquo;s ability \r\n    to do them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; When offering naafil (supererogatory) prayers when \r\n    travelling, whether by plane, car or atop a camel; one may pray in whatever \r\n    direction one is facing. This applies to naafil prayers such as Witr, night \r\n    prayers (qiyaam), Duha and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The traveller should offer all the naafil prayers exactly \r\n    like one who is not travelling, except the regular Sunnah prayers such as \r\n    the Sunnahs of Zuhr, Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;. The Sunnah is not to offer these \r\n    prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person wants to offer naafil prayers whilst travelling, \r\n    he may offer them whatever direction he is facing. This is narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Saheehayn<\/i> from the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In these three cases it is not obligatory to face towards the \r\n    qiblah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to one who is \r\n    ignorant, he has to face towards the qiblah, but if he tries to work it out \r\n    then he finds out that he got it wrong, he does not have to repeat the \r\n    prayer. We do not say that the obligation to face the qiblah is waived, \r\n    rather he has to face the qiblah and he should try his best to do so. If he \r\n    does his best then finds out that he got it wrong, he does not have to \r\n    repeat his prayer. The evidence for that is the fact that the Sahaabah who \r\n    were unaware that the qiblah had been changed to the Ka&rsquo;bah were praying \r\n    Fajr one day in the mosque of Quba&rsquo; when a man came to them and said: \r\n    &ldquo;Qur&rsquo;aan has been revealed to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) this night, and he has been commanded to \r\n    face towards the Ka&rsquo;bah, so turn to face it.&rdquo; They were facing towards Syria \r\n    and they turned to face towards the Ka&rsquo;bah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 304; Muslim, 526.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After the Ka&rsquo;bah had been behind them, they put it in front \r\n    of them, so they turned around but continued to pray.

The text of the question is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We hope that you can provide us with a fatwa \r\n    concerning the way of determining the times of Maghrib, Isha&rsquo; and Fajr prayer, and also the first day of Ramadaan and the first day of Eid \r\n    al-Fitr. That is because the way the sun rises and sets in the countries of Northern Europe that are close to the North Pole is different from the \r\n    way it rises and sets in the eastern Muslim countries. The reason for that has to do with the timing of the end of the red and white twilight. It \r\n    may be noted that in summer the white twilight lasts almost the whole night, so it is difficult to determine the time of &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; and the onset of \r\n    the dawn.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom \r\n    of Saudi Arabia issued a statement on the determining of the times of prayer, determining the start of dawn each day, and the end of the dawn in \r\n    Ramadan, in countries such as yours. This is what it said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After studying, researching and discussing \r\n    the matter, the Council decided the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whoever resides in a country where the night \r\n    can be distinguished from the day by the onset of dawn and the setting of the sun, but the day is extremely long in the summer and extremely short \r\n    in the winter, is obliged to perform the five daily prayers at the times known in sharee&rsquo;ah. That is because of the general meaning of the words \r\n    of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><span>&ldquo;Perform As&#8209;Salaat (Iqamaat&#8209;as&#8209;Salaat) from mid&#8209;day till the darkness of the night (i.e. \r\n    the Zuhr, &lsquo;Asr, Maghrib, and &lsquo;Ishaa&rsquo; prayers), and recite the Qur&rsquo;aan in the early dawn (i.e. the &mdash; Fajr morning prayer). Verily, the recitation \r\n    of the Qur&rsquo;aan in the early dawn (i.e. the morning &mdash; Fajr prayer) is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and \r\n    the night)&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Isra&rsquo; 17:78]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, As&#8209;Salaah (the prayer) is \r\n    enjoined on the believers at fixed hours&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:103]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And because it was proven from Buraydah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) that a man asked the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the times of the prayers, and he \r\n    said to him: &ldquo;Pray with us for these two&rdquo; meaning two days. When the sun passed its zenith, he told Bilaal to give the adhaan, then he told him to \r\n    give the iqaamah for Zuhr. Then he told him to give the iqaamah for &lsquo;Asr when the sun was still high and clear white. Then he told him to give the \r\n    iqaamah for Maghrib when the sun had set. Then he told him to give the iqaamah for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; when the red afterglow (twilight) had disappeared.&nbsp; Then \r\n    he told him to give the iqaamah for Fajr when the dawn had appeared. Then on the second day, he told him to delay Zuhr until the extreme heat had \r\n    passed and he did so. He prayed &lsquo;Asr when the sun was high, delaying it beyond the time he had previously performed it. He prayed Maghrib before \r\n    the twilight had vanished; he prayed &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; when a third of the night had passed; and he prayed Fajr when there was clear daylight. Then he said: \r\n    &ldquo;Where is the man who was asking about the time of prayer?&rdquo; The man said, &ldquo;Here I am, O Messenger of Allaah.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The time for your prayer is within the limits of what you have seen.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr ibn \r\n    al-&lsquo;Aas that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The time for Zuhr is from when the sun has passed its \r\n    zenith and a man&rsquo;s shadow is equal in length to his height, until the time for &lsquo;Asr comes. The time for &lsquo;Asr lasts until the sun turns yellow. The \r\n    time for Maghrib lasts until the twilight has faded. The time for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; lasts until midnight. The time for Subh (Fajr) prayer lasts from the \r\n    beginning of the pre-dawn so long as the sun has not yet started to rise. When the sun starts to rise then stop praying, for it rises between the \r\n    two horns of the Shaytaan.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And there are other ahaadeeth which have been \r\n    narrated concerning the definition of the times of the five daily prayers through the words and actions of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him). It makes no difference whether the night and day are long or short, so long as the times of the prayers can be \r\n    distinguished by the signs which were identified by the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is with regard to the timings of the \r\n    prayers. With regard to the timings of their fast in Ramadaan, those who are accountable should refrain from food, drink and everything else that \r\n    invalidates the fast each day of Ramadaan, from the time of dawn until sunset in their countries, so long as the night can be distinguished from \r\n    the day, and when day and night together add up to twenty-four hours. It is permissible for them to eat, drink, have intercourse, etc during the \r\n    night only, even if it is short. The sharee&rsquo;ah of Islam is universal and applies to all people in all countries. Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;and eat and drink until the white thread \r\n    (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:187]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whoever is unable to complete the fast because the day is so \r\n    long, or who knows from experience or from the advice of a competent. trustworthy doctor, or thinks it most likely that fasting will lead to his \r\n    death or make him severely ill, or will make his sickness worse or impede his recovery, may break his fast and make up the days that he misses in \r\n    a month when he can make them up.

They should estimate their times based on the \r\n    nearest country in which the times of the five daily prayers can be distinguished from one another, because it was proven in the hadeeth of the \r\n    Isra&rsquo; and Mi&rsquo;raaj (Prophet&rsquo;s Night Journey and Ascent into Heaven) that Allaah enjoined on this ummah fifty prayers each day and night, then the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept asking his Lord to reduce it until He said, &ldquo;O Muhammad, they are five prayers each \r\n    day and night, and for each prayer will be the reward of ten, that is fifty prayers&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it was proven in the hadeeth of Talhah \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Ubayd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and we heard his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he came near and then we came to \r\n    know that he was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;(You have to offer) five \r\n    prayers each day and night.&rdquo; The man asked, &ldquo;Do I have to do anything else?&rdquo; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said, &ldquo;No, unless you want to offer voluntary (naafil) prayers&rdquo;&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it was proven in the hadeeth of Anas ibn \r\n    Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: We were forbidden to ask the Messenger of Allaah (S) <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) about anything, so we used to like it when an intelligent man from among the desert people came and asked him a question in our hearing. \r\n    A man from among the desert people came and said, &ldquo;O Muhammad, your messenger came to us and said that you claim that Allaah sent you.&rdquo; He said, \r\n    &ldquo;He spoke the truth.&rdquo; &hellip; The man said, &ldquo;And your messenger claimed that we have to offer five prayers each day and night.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;He spoke the truth.&rdquo; The man said, &ldquo;By the One Who sent you, has Allaah enjoined that upon you?&rdquo; He \r\n    said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his companions about the Dajjaal (antichrist). He was asked how long he would stay on earth, and he \r\n    said, &ldquo;Forty days, one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest like your days.&rdquo; It was said, &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, the day which is like a year, will the prayers of one day be sufficient for us then?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No, estimate them.&rdquo; So the day which will \r\n    be like a year is not regarded as one day in which only five prayers will be sufficient, rather we are obliged to offer five prayers in each \r\n    twenty-four hour period. He commanded them to offer the prayers at intervals as on a regular day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So the Muslims in the country mentioned in \r\n    the question have to define the times of prayer in that land, basing those times on the closest country in which the night and day can be \r\n    distinguished from one another and the times of the five daily prayers are known according to the signs described in sharee&rsquo;ah, within each \r\n    twenty-four hour period.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly they also have to fast Ramadaan. \r\n    They can set the time for their fast and determine the beginning and end of Ramadaan and the times of starting and breaking the fast each day by \r\n    the dawn and sunset each day in the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day. The total period must add up to twenty-four \r\n    hours, because of the hadeeth of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the Dajjaal mentioned above, in which he told \r\n    his companions how to determine the times of the five daily prayers. There is no difference in this regard between fasting and prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.

Rather the issue here is whether the prayer is valid or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan has issued a fatwa stating that if a \r\n    woman prays in tight clothes that show the shape of her &lsquo;awrah, her prayer \r\n    is valid, although she is sinning by wearing these clothes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible to wear tight clothes which show the \r\n    limbs and the shape of a woman&rsquo;s body and buttocks.

This is one aspect. Another aspect is that \r\n    it is a cause of temptation and attracts attention, especially in the case \r\n    of women. So women should cover themselves with loose garments which will \r\n    cover them and not show any of the limbs of their body or attract attention. \r\n    So it should not be a thin or see-through garment, rather it should be a \r\n    concealing garment which will cover the woman completely.

So give instructions that the head of the statue at \r\n    the door should be cut off, so that it will look like a tree. And give \r\n    instructions that the curtain should be cut up and made into two pillows \r\n    that will be placed on the ground and stepped on.

Thus the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) differentiated \r\n    between the takbeer and the tasmee&rsquo;. With regard to the takbeer, we say what \r\n    he says, but with regard to the tasmee&rsquo; we do not say what he says, because \r\n    his words &ldquo;when he says <i>Sami&rsquo;a Allaahu liman hamidah<\/i>, then say <i>\r\n    Rabbana wa laka&rsquo;l-hamd<\/i>&rdquo; are tantamount to saying: when he says <i>Sami&rsquo;a \r\n    Allaahu liman hamidah<\/i>, do not say <i>Sami&rsquo;a Allaahu liman hamidah<\/i>, \r\n    rather say <i>Rabbana wa laka&rsquo;l-hamd<\/i>.

It is not permissible for anyone to pray sitting unless he is \r\n    unable to stand, or standing is very difficult for him, or he is sick and \r\n    there is the fear that his sickness may become worse if he prays standing \r\n    up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That also includes a paralyzed person who is unable to stand \r\n    at all, and an elderly person for whom it is difficult to stand, and a sick \r\n    person who will be harmed by standing because it will either make his \r\n    sickness worse or delay his recovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle concerning that is the report narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (1050) from &lsquo;Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    who said: I had haemorrhoids, and I asked the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about praying. He said: &ldquo;Pray standing; if \r\n    you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If standing \r\n    will make a sick person&rsquo;s sickness worse, then he should pray sitting. The \r\n    scholars are unanimously agreed that a person who cannot stand may pray \r\n    sitting. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \r\n    to &lsquo;Imraan ibn Husayn: &ldquo;Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if \r\n    you cannot, then lying on your side.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was also narrated by al-Bukhaari, Abu Dawood and \r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, who added: &ldquo;If you cannot, then lying on your back, and Allaah \r\n    does not burden any soul beyond its scope.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of \r\n    Allaah (S) fell from a horse and was injured on his right side. We entered \r\n    upon him to visit him and the time for prayer came. He prayed sitting and we \r\n    prayed sitting behind him. Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he is able to stand but he fears that his sickness will be \r\n    made worse, or that his recovery may be delayed, or it is too hard for him \r\n    to stand, then he may pray sitting down. Something similar was said by \r\n    Maalik and Ishaaq. Maymoon ibn Mahraan said: If he is unable to stand for \r\n    any worldly purpose, then let him pray sitting. Something similar was \r\n    narrated from Ahmad.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    i.e., if he is able to stand for some worldly purpose then he \r\n    must also pray standing and it is not permissible for him to pray sitting. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: But \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;[He] has not laid upon you \r\n    in religion any hardship&rdquo; [al-Hajj 22:78]<\/i>. Obliging a person to stand in \r\n    this case is hardship. And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) sat when he had been injured on his right side, although it \r\n    appears that he was not completely unable to stand, but because of the \r\n    difficulty involved in standing, this requirement was waived for him, and is \r\n    waived for others too&hellip; If a person is able to stand by leaning on a stick or \r\n    on the wall, or leaning on someone who is next to him, then he should do \r\n    that, because he is able to stand without it causing him harm, so he must do \r\n    it, just as he should if he is able to do it without these things. End quote \r\n    from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/443&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The ummah is \r\n    unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand in an obligatory prayer \r\n    may pray sitting, and he does not have to repeat it. Our companions said: \r\n    That does not detract from the reward that he would earn if he prayed \r\n    standing, because he is excused. It is proven in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> \r\n    that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;If a person is sick or is travelling, there is written for him \r\n    (the reward) for the deeds he used to do when he was healthy or not \r\n    travelling.&rdquo; Our companions said:&nbsp; For a person to be allowed to pray \r\n    sitting down, it is not a condition that he should be completely unable to \r\n    stand, and it is not enough if he finds it a little difficult; rather what \r\n    counts is evident hardship. If he fears that it will be extremely difficult \r\n    or it will make his sickness worse, etc, or a person who is travelling by \r\n    boat fears that he may drown or become dizzy, then he may pray sitting, and \r\n    he does not have to repeat it. End quote from <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/201.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    explained the definition of the hardship which makes it permissible for a \r\n    person not to stand in an obligatory prayer, and how to sit. He said: The \r\n    definition of difficulty is that which takes away khushoo&rsquo; (proper focus and \r\n    humility). Khushoo&rsquo; means that the heart is focused and at peace. If it is \r\n    the case that standing will make a person severely anxious and have no peace \r\n    of mind, and he is longing to get to the end of al-Faatihah so that he can \r\n    bow because he is finding it too hard to stand, then it is too difficult for \r\n    him to pray standing, so he should pray sitting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to one who is afraid and cannot pray \r\n    standing, such as if he is praying behind a wall, and there are enemies \r\n    around watching out for him, and if he stands they will be able to see him \r\n    from behind the wall, but if he sits he will be hidden from his enemies. In \r\n    this case we say to him: Pray sitting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is indicated by the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on foot \r\n    or riding&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:239]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah has exempted the \r\n    one who is afraid from bowing, prostrating and sitting, and the same applies \r\n    to standing if he is afraid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But how should he sit?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should sit mutarabbi&rsquo;an on his buttocks, with each calf \r\n    tucked up to the thigh. This is called tarabbu&rsquo;, and in this posture the \r\n    calf and thigh on the right and the left are all visible, whereas in the \r\n    case of iftiraash the calf disappears beneath the thigh, but in tarabbu&rsquo; all \r\n    four parts (thigh and calf on both sides) are visible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is it obligatory to sit like this?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    No, it is Sunnah. If a person prays muftarishan (in the \r\n    posture called iftiraash) there is nothing wrong with it, and if he prays \r\n    muhtabiyan (sitting with one&rsquo;s legs drawn up and wrapped in one's garment) \r\n    there is nothing wrong with it, because of the general meaning of the words \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;If he \r\n    cannot, then sitting.&rdquo; He did not explain how he is to sit. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person says, Is there any evidence to suggest that he \r\n    should pray mutarabbi&rsquo;an? The answer is yes. &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said: I saw the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) praying \r\n    mutarabbi&rsquo;an. And because that is usually more comfortable than \r\n    al-iftiraash. It is well known that standing needs a longer recitation than \r\n    saying, &ldquo;<i>Rabb ighfir li warhamni<\/i> (Lord forgive me and have mercy on \r\n    me).&rdquo; Hence it is better to sit mutarabbi&rsquo;an. And there is another benefit, \r\n    which is differentiating between sitting instead of standing, and sitting \r\n    when one is supposed to sit; if we say that a person should sit muftarishan \r\n    during the time of standing, there would be no difference between the way of \r\n    sitting when one is supposed to and the way of sitting when it is done \r\n    instead of standing. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If that is at the time of bowing, some of them say that it \r\n    should be muftarishan but the correct view is that it should be \r\n    mutarabbi&rsquo;an, because when bowing a person&rsquo;s leg and thigh are upright, and \r\n    he only bends his back. So we say that if a person is mutarabbi&rsquo;an he should \r\n    remain like that and bow in that posture. This is the correct view \r\n    concerning this matter.

I put my hand on his head and he said, &lsquo;What is \r\n    the matter, O &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I was told, O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah that you said, &lsquo;The prayer of a man who sits is half of the prayer of \r\n    a man who stands,&rsquo; and you are praying sitting.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, but I am not \r\n    like one of you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Sharh \r\n    Muslim<\/i>: What this means is that the prayer of one who sits brings half \r\n    the reward of the prayer of one who stands, which means that it is valid but \r\n    brings a lesser reward. This hadeeth is to be understood as referring to a \r\n    naafil prayer offered sitting when one is able to stand. This brings half \r\n    the reward of a prayer offered standing. But if a person offers a naafil \r\n    prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, then the reward is not \r\n    reduced, rather it will be the same as one who stands. With regard to \r\n    obligatory prayers, if a person prays sitting down when he is able to stand, \r\n    his prayer is not valid and he will not be rewarded, rather he is sinning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our companions (the Shaafa&rsquo;is) said: If he believes that to \r\n    be permissible, he is a kaafir and is subject to the rulings on apostates, \r\n    just like one who regards zina (adultery), riba and other haraam things to \r\n    be permissible.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;If a person offers an obligatory prayer sitting down because \r\n    he is unable to stand, or lying down because he is unable to stand or sit, \r\n    then his reward will be like that of one who stands, and it will not be \r\n    reduced, according to the consensus of our companions. The hadeeth about the \r\n    reduction in reward is to be understood as applying to one who offers a \r\n    naafil prayer sitting when he is able to stand. This differentiation is our \r\n    view and is the view of the majority concerning the meaning of this hadeeth. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he said: With regard to the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;I am not like any one of you,&rdquo; \r\n    according to our companions it is one of the unique characteristics of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that his naafil \r\n    prayers offered sitting when he was able to stand were like his naafil \r\n    prayers offered standing, as an honour for him, as he was also singled out \r\n    for other honours that are well known in the books of our companions and \r\n    others.

Abu \r\nDawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that she was \r\nasked about a woman who prayed in a khimaar and qamees (dress or gown). She \r\nsaid, &quot;There is nothing wrong with it if the dir&rsquo; (chemise) covers her feet.&quot; In any \r\ncase, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side. As far as the hands are \r\nconcerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or \r\nuncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.

But if he does both of them, that is better and is more on the \r\n      safe side, and after that he may bow; so he may say the first takbeer \r\n      whilst standing then say takbeer whilst leaning forward for bowing. This \r\n      is the most complete way. But if he does not say the second takbeer and \r\n      limits it to the first one, that is sufficient according to the correct \r\n      view.

Drawing an analogy between the end of the prayer and \r\n    the beginning is not correct; the intention is regarded as essential at the \r\n    beginning so that it covers all other parts of the prayer, unlike the \r\n    ending.

This was stated by Ahmad who said: \r\n    He should say the salaam in the prayer and intend by saying it to respond to \r\n    the imam, because of the report narrated by Muslim from Jaabir ibn Samurah \r\n    who said: When we prayed with the Prophet (sa), we used to say: As-salaamu \r\n    &lsquo;alaykum, as-salaamu &lsquo;alaykum.

If he says the tasleem at the end of his prayer without the \r\n    intention, that is acceptable because of his previous intention, because he \r\n    does not have to renew the intention for every part of the prayer.

Some of them are of the view that the worshipper \r\n    should clench his right hand and point with his index finger in the sitting \r\n    between the two prostrations as he does during the tashahhud, and some of \r\n    them say that he should stretch out his hand and not clench it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Then he \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) raised his head, saying takbeer \r\n    but not raising his hands, and he lifted his head from prostration before \r\n    his hands, then he sat muftarishan, spreading out his left foot and sitting \r\n    on it, and holding his right foot upright. Al-Nasaa&rsquo;i narrated that Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Umar said: One of the Sunnahs of prayer is to hold the right foot upright \r\n    with the toes facing towards the qiblah and to sit on the left foot. And \r\n    there is no report to suggest that the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) sat at this point in the prayer in any other way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he would place his hands on his thighs and place his \r\n    elbows on his thighs and the ends of his fingers on his knees, and he would \r\n    clench two of this fingers and make a circle, then he would raise his \r\n    finger, supplicating with it and moving it. This was said by Waa&rsquo;il ibn \r\n    Hajar. Then he would say between the two prostrations: &ldquo;O Allaah, forgive \r\n    me, have mercy on me, help me, guide me and grant me provision.&rdquo; This is how \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated it from him (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allaah be upon him). Hudhayfah stated that he used to say: \r\n    &ldquo;Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me.&rdquo; End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, \r\n    1\/230&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the left hand, it should be laid flat with all \r\n    the fingers hand close together and pointing towards the qiblah and the edge \r\n    of the elbow should be at the end of the thigh, meaning that he should not \r\n    hold it away from the body; rather it should be resting on the thigh. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the right hand, the Sunnah indicates that he should \r\n    clench the pinkie finger and ring finger, make a circle with the thumb and \r\n    middle finger, and raise the forefinger, moving it when saying the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. \r\n    This is what it says in the reports from Imam Ahmad of the hadeeth of Waa&rsquo;il \r\n    ibn Hajar, with an isnaad of which the author of <i>al-Fath al-Rabbaani<\/i> \r\n    said is jayyid. The commentator on <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> said that it is \r\n    saheeh, and that was also the view of Ibn al-Qayyim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the fuqaha&rsquo;, they said that the right hand should be \r\n    laid flat when sitting between the two prostrations, like the left hand, but \r\n    following the Sunnah is better, and it is not narrated in the Sunnah in any \r\n    hadeeth, whether it be saheeh (sound), da&rsquo;eef (weak) or hasan (good) that \r\n    the right hand should be spread out on the right thigh. Rather it is \r\n    narrated that it should be clenched; the pinkie finger and ring finger \r\n    should be clenched, and a circle should be made with the thumb and middle \r\n    finger, or the middle finger should also be clenched, and the thumb should \r\n    be clenched with it when sitting in prayer. Thus it was narrated in general \r\n    terms, and in some versions it says, &ldquo;when he sits for the tashahhud.&rdquo; Both \r\n    versions appear in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i>. So when we take the phrase &ldquo;when he \r\n    sits in prayer&rdquo;, we say: This is general and applies to all sittings, and \r\n    the words &ldquo;when he sits for the tashahhud&rdquo; in some versions do not refer to \r\n    that specific point in the prayer, because we have a principle which was \r\n    mentioned by the scholars of usool, and among those who always mentioned it \r\n    was al-Shawkaani in <i>Nayl al-Awtaar<\/i> and al-Shanqeeti in <i>Adwa&rsquo; \r\n    al-Bayaan<\/i>, among others, who say that if there is a report stating that \r\n    the ruling is broadly application and there is another report which mentions \r\n    that ruling in a specific situation, that does not mean that the second \r\n    report is specifying and limiting the application of the ruling mentioned in \r\n    the first report; rather the specifying and limiting is to be understood as \r\n    applying when a report refers to specific situations with a ruling different \r\n    from that which is applicable in regular situations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of the first is if I tell you: honour the \r\n    students. This is general in meaning and includes all students. Then I tell \r\n    you: honour So and so - who is one of the students. Does this imply that I \r\n    should not honour other students? The answer is no, but it implies that \r\n    there is a particular reason why I singled him out for mention.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And an example of the second is if I say: honour the \r\n    students, then I say: do not honour So and so - who is one of the students. \r\n    This is specifying, because in the first case I mentioned So and so so as to \r\n    apply a ruling to him that is applicable to everyone, because he is one of \r\n    the students, but in the second case, I mentioned him so as to apply a \r\n    ruling different from the ruling that is applicable to everyone. Hence they \r\n    say when defining specification in the context of a ruling that is different \r\n    or when excluding some from that ruling: therefore a different ruling must \r\n    be applied to them. But if the ruling that applies to these is the same \r\n    ruling as is applicable to the others, the majority of scholars of usool \r\n    think that it does not indicate exclusivity for this group, as stated by the \r\n    author of Adwa&rsquo; al-Bayaan. This is clear, as in the examples that we have \r\n    given. Based on this, the fact that some of the versions of the hadeeth of \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Umar which refer to clenching the hand in the tashahhud only does not \r\n    mean that this is the only point in the prayer in which that is to be done, \r\n    because there are other reports which state that this is to be done in any \r\n    sitting in the prayer.

If he cannot recite the opening du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and prayer \r\n    for refuge and recite before the imam starts to recite the next soorah, then \r\n    he should not recite the opening du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, because the opening du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is \r\n    Sunnah; rather he should recite the prayer for refuge and al-Faatihah, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \r\n    with regard to reciting behind the imam: &ldquo;Do not do anything but recite the \r\n    Essence of the Qur&rsquo;aan [al-Faatihah], for there is no prayer for the one who \r\n    does not recite it.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 311; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is according to the \r\n    view that it is obligatory for the person who is praying behind an imam in a \r\n    prayer where Qur&rsquo;aan is recited out loud to recite al-Faatihah.

Otherwise he \r\n    should focus on al-Faatihah after saying the opening Takbeer, and not recite \r\n    the opening du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, because it is more important to pay attention to that \r\n    which is obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>Mughni al-Muhtaaj<\/i>, 1\/257; <i>Talbees Iblees<\/i>, \r\n    p. 161&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam bows, the \r\n    person praying behind him should leave the rest of al-Faatihah and bow with \r\n    him, because he has only caught up with what he has recited, and he has \r\n    caught up with the rak&rsquo;ah, as is the case if he catches up with him when he \r\n    is bowing. So in this case the obligation to recite al-Faatihah is waived, \r\n    and he should not lag behind his imam in order to complete al-Faatihah, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;When he bows, then bow.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 378; Muslim, 414.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Reciting the opening du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is Sunnah \r\n    and reciting al-Faatihah is obligatory for the one who is praying behind an \r\n    imam, according to the correct scholarly opinion.

The hadeeth which speaks of the Prophet (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) praying in Haashiyat al-Mataaf without a \r\n    sutrah and with people passing in front of him is not saheeh, even though it \r\n    does not say that they were passing between him and his place of \r\n    prostration.

He said: &ldquo;When one of you finishes reciting the \r\n    final tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allaah from four things: from the \r\n    punishment of Hell, from the punishment of the grave, from the trials of \r\n    life and death, and from the evil of the Dajjaal.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim \r\n    (588).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars are of the view that reciting this \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is obligatory. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, then in order to be on the safe side, the \r\n    person who is praying behind an imam should not say the salaam until he has \r\n    completed the tashahhud and sent blessings upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and sought refuge with Allaah from these \r\n    four things. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: \r\n    During the prayer, the imam said the salaam and I had only completed a small \r\n    part of al-tahiyyaat. Should I repeat my prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: You have to complete the tashahhud even if it \r\n    means that you are a little behind your imam, because the final tashahhud is \r\n    a pillar or essential part of the prayer according to the more correct of \r\n    the two scholarly opinions, and it includes sending blessings upon the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So what you have to do is complete it, even if that is after \r\n    the imam says the salaam. It also includes seeking refuge with Allaah from \r\n    the punishment of Hell, the torment of the grave, the trials of life and \r\n    death and the trial of the Dajjaal, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined seeking refuge from these four \r\n    things in the final tashahhud, and because some of the scholars said that \r\n    this is obligatory.

He said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Are the words &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu &lsquo;alayka<\/i> (peace be upon you)&rdquo; \r\n    a statement or a supplication?

This is a statement which is \r\n    serving as a supplication.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is this addressed to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) as people address one another?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is No. If that were the case, it would invalidate \r\n    the prayer, because this prayer should not contain anything of human speech. \r\n    If that were the case, the Sahaabah would have spoken these words out loud \r\n    so that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) could \r\n    hear them, and he would have returned the greeting to them as he used to do \r\n    when they met him. But as Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in his book <i>\r\n    Iqtida&rsquo; al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem<\/i>: Because you are thinking of the \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is so strong when \r\n    you send salaams upon him, it is as if he is there in front of you and you \r\n    are addressing him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the Sahaabah used to say &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu &lsquo;alayka<\/i> \r\n    (peace be upon you)&rdquo;, but he did not hear them, and they would say, &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu \r\n    &lsquo;alayka<\/i> (peace be upon you)&rdquo; when they were in another land. And we say \r\n    &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu &lsquo;alayka<\/i> (peace be upon you)&rdquo; when we are in a land other \r\n    than his, and in a time other than his.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the report narrated in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> \r\n    from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, which says that after the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed away they used to say &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu \r\n    &lsquo;ala al-nabi wa rahmat-Allaahi wa barakaatuhu<\/i> (peace be upon the Prophet \r\n    and the mercy and blessings of Allaah)&rdquo; &ndash; this was the ijtihaad of Ibn \r\n    Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), which differed from that of one \r\n    who was more knowledgeable than him, namely &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab, for he \r\n    addressed the people from the minbar of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said in the tashahhud: &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu \r\n    &lsquo;alayka ayyhu&rsquo;l-nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allaah<\/i> (peace be upon you, O Prophet \r\n    and the mercy of Allaah)&rdquo;, as was narrated by Maalik in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    with the soundest of isnaads. &lsquo;Umar said this in the presence of the \r\n    Sahaabah and they approved of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) taught it to his ummah, and he even taught it to Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, \r\n    holding his hand between his own, so that he would remember this wording. He \r\n    used to teach it to them as he used to teach them a soorah from the Qur&rsquo;aan. \r\n    And he knew that he was going to die, because Allaah said to him \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) \r\n    will die&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Zumar 39:30]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h1>But he did not say: after I die, say &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu &lsquo;ala \r\n    al-nabi<\/i> (peace be upon the Prophet)&rdquo;, rather he taught them the \r\n    tashahhud as he used to teach them a soorah of the Qur&rsquo;aan, with this \r\n    wording. Hence we should not rely on the ijtihaad of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, rather we \r\n    should say, &ldquo;<i>al-salaamu &lsquo;alayka ayyhu&rsquo;l-nabiyyu<\/i> (peace be upon you, O \r\n    Prophet)&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/h1>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 3\/150-151&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5063","question_id":"5063","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to point with his index finger and move it during the tashahhud when praying.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The scholars differed concerning that and \r\n    there are several points of view.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The Hanafis say that the finger should be \r\n    raised when saying &ldquo;Laa (no)&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah)&rdquo; and it should \r\n    be lowered when saying, &ldquo;ill-Allaah (except Allaah).&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The Shaafa&rsquo;is say that it should be \r\n    raised when saying &ldquo;ill-Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; The Maalikis say that it should be moved \r\n    right and left until one finishes the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The Hanbalis say that one should point \r\n    with the finger when saying the name of Allaah, without moving it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said: There is no basis for any of these definitions and manners in the Sunnah.

Al-Nawawi (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: Note that there is no specific du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for Qunoot according to the preferred point of view. Any du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; that is said \r\n    will serve as Qunoot, even if one recites a verse or verses from the Qur&rsquo;aan that include words of supplication, this will count as Qunoot, but it \r\n    is better to recite the words that were narrated in the Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah<\/i>, \r\n    p. 50&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; As for what the brother mentions about \r\n    reciting Qur&rsquo;aan instead of the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of Qunoot, there is no doubt that he should not do this, because the purpose behind Qunoot is du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; or \r\n    supplication. Hence if these verses include words of supplication, it is permissible to recite them as Qunoot, for example, the verse in which \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Our Lord!

This befits the state \r\n    of the one who is praying, for he is facing his Lord and conversing with Him \r\n    so long as he is praying. When he says the salaam that conversation comes to \r\n    a close and he is no longer standing before Him and close to Him. So why \r\n    should he not ask of Him whilst he is conversing with Him and close to Him \r\n    and turning to Him, and then ask of Him when he has turned away from Him? \r\n    Undoubtedly it is better to do the opposite. There is another subtle point \r\n    to be made, which is that when the worshipper has finished praying, and he \r\n    has remembered Allaah and proclaimed His oneness, glorified Him, praised Him \r\n    and magnified Him by reciting the dhikrs that are prescribed following the \r\n    prayer, it is mustahabb to send blessings upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) after that, and to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; as he \r\n    wishes, His du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; should come immediately after this second act of worship, \r\n    not because it is after the prayer but because it is mustahabb for anyone \r\n    who remembers Allaah and praises Him and sends blessings upon the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n    after that, as it says in the hadeeth of Faddaalah ibn &lsquo;Ubayd: &ldquo;When any one \r\n    of you prays, let him start by praising Allaah, then let him send blessings \r\n    upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then let \r\n    him say du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; however he wishes.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Tirmidhi said: (it is) a saheeh hadeeth.

This is where the hands should be during\r\n    the qiyaam before rukoo&#146; and after.

But it is better to \r\n    recite out loud in the prayers where doing so is customary, as in Fajr and \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person deliberately does not recite out loud when he is \r\n    leading the prayer, his prayer is valid but it is lacking.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;If a person is praying alone, he has the choice between \r\n    reciting out loud or silently. He should look at what is more likely to \r\n    increase his focus and humility in prayer, and do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    13\/73&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that a Muslim is obliged to adhere to \r\n    the laws of Allaah, without making that dependent on whether he knows the \r\n    reason or wisdom behind it.

In \r\n    order to achieve this the people must all be gathered in one place, except \r\n    in cases of necessity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second reason is that the imam&rsquo;s recitation out loud \r\n    during the prayer is a completion of the two khutbahs. Hence the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite in Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    prayer soorahs that were appropriate, either al-Jumu&rsquo;ah and al-Munaafiqeen, \r\n    because the former mentions Jumu&rsquo;ah and encourages us to attend the prayer, \r\n    and the latter describes hypocrisy and denounces its people; or he would \r\n    recite al-A&rsquo;la and al-Ghaashiyah, because the former mentions the beginning \r\n    of creation and describes various creatures and the beginning of divine \r\n    laws, and the latter describes the Resurrection and rewards and \r\n    punishments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third reason is so as to distinguish between Zuhr and \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fourth reason is so that it will be similar to Eid \r\n    prayer, because Jumu&rsquo;ah is the weekly &ldquo;Eid&rdquo;.

There are several opinions, one of which is that \r\n    it is a pillar or essential part of the prayer, without which the prayer is \r\n    not valid.

He said \r\n    in his commentary on <i>Zaad al-Mustaqni&rsquo;<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The words &ldquo;Sending \r\n    blessings upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)&rdquo; \r\n    mean, in the last tashahhud, which is the twelfth &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is the fact that the Sahaabah asked the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, we have learned how to send salaams upon you, how should we send \r\n    blessings upon you?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Say: <i>Allaahumma salli &lsquo;ala Muhammad, wa \r\n    &lsquo;ala aali Muhammad<\/i> (O Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the \r\n    family of Muhammad).&rdquo; A command implies that it is obligatory, and the basic \r\n    principle concerning an obligation is that it is a must (fard), and if it is \r\n    not done, then the prayer is invalid. This is how the fuqaha (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on them) settled this issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you think about this hadeeth, it is not obvious \r\n    therefrom that sending blessings upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) is a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of the prayer, because the Sahaabah \r\n    were simply asking how to do it &ndash; how should we send blessings upon you? So \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught them how \r\n    to do it. Hence we say that the command in the word &ldquo;<i>Qoolu<\/i> (Say)&rdquo; \r\n    does not mean that it is obligatory; rather the purpose here was to teach \r\n    them. If there is any other evidence which enjoins sending blessings upon \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in prayer, then \r\n    it must be followed; if there is nothing apart from this report, this does \r\n    not indicate that it is obligatory, let alone indicating that it is a \r\n    &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of the prayer. Hence the scholars differed concerning this matter \r\n    and there were several opinions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The first opinion is that it is a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of prayer. \r\n    This is the well-known view of our madhhab, that prayer is not valid without \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The second view is \r\n    that it is obligatory, but is not a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo;, and the prostration of \r\n    forgetfulness (sujood al-sahw) is required if it is omitted by mistake.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: That is because his words, &ldquo;Say: <i>Allaahumma \r\n    salli &lsquo;ala Muhammad, wa &lsquo;ala aali Muhammad<\/i> (O Allaah, send blessings \r\n    upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad)&rdquo;&nbsp; imply both a command and \r\n    teaching, and we cannot say that it a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of the prayer without which \r\n    prayer is not valid when it possible to understand the phrase as meaning \r\n    that it is an obligatory part of prayer and not a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; The third view is that sending blessings upon the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a Sunnah, and is not \r\n    obligatory or a pillar of the prayer. This view was narrated from Imam \r\n    Ahmad. If a person deliberately omits it, his prayer is still valid, because \r\n    the evidence quoted by those who regard it as obligatory and those who \r\n    regard it as a pillar of the prayer does not clearly indicate either of the \r\n    things suggested, so the basic principle is that it is not essential.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view which is most likely to be correct because \r\n    there is no other evidence apart from this report which the fuqaha&rsquo; (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on them) quoted as evidence.

Then \r\n    he said: I do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars \r\n    concerning the fact that it is mustahabb for everyone who leads the people \r\n    in prayer to make the prayer light so long as it is still complete.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (1\/323):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is mustahabb for the \r\n    imam to recite Qur&rsquo;aan, tasbeeh and the tashahhud in as slow a manner as one \r\n    who is reciting it slowly behind him, and he should make his bowing and \r\n    prostration as long as he thinks that the old, young and heavy need. If he \r\n    does not do that, and he does it at his own pace without paying attention to \r\n    the people behind him, it is makrooh but is still sufficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (6\/213) it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is makrooh for him to \r\n    rush so much that the one who is praying behind him cannot do the Sunnah, \r\n    such as saying the tasbeeh three times when bowing and prostrating, and \r\n    completing the Sunnah words in the final tashahhud.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in an essay on the rulings on \r\n    fasting, zakaah and Taraweeh:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what some people do, hastening too much, this \r\n    is contrary to what is prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah, and if he does it to such an \r\n    extent that he omits an obligatory or essential part of the prayer, then it \r\n    invalidates the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Many imams do not perform Taraweeh prayer in a deliberate \r\n    manner, and this is a mistake on their part, because the imam is not praying \r\n    for himself only, rather he is praying for himself and others. He is like a \r\n    leader who is obliged to do that which is in the best interests of all.

This applies \r\n    only to the first two rak&rsquo;ahs because the worshipper has more energy then. \r\n    Because the day is the time of distractions and mixing with people, it is \r\n    required to recite silently, because the daytime is not the best time to \r\n    focus fully on conversing with Allaah. The morning (Fajr) prayer is joined \r\n    to the night prayers because its time is not usually a time when there are \r\n    distractions, like Friday. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    I&rsquo;laam al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een<\/i> (2\/91):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the distinction between the nighttime prayers \r\n    and the daytime prayers, in terms of reciting out loud and reciting \r\n    silently, there is great wisdom in that, because the night is a time when \r\n    voices and movements are stilled, and hearts are focused and have renewed \r\n    energy. The day is the time when people are busy with their day-to-day \r\n    occupations, and the night is the time when a person can focus with his \r\n    heart on what he is saying with his tongue. Hence the Sunnah is to make the \r\n    recitations in Fajr longer than in other prayers. The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite between \r\n    sixty and one hundred verses in them, and Abu Bakr used to recite al-Baqarah \r\n    in them, and &lsquo;Umar used to recite al-Nahl, Hood, Bani Israa&rsquo;eel, Yoonus and \r\n    similar soorahs, because the heart is more free of distractions when it has \r\n    just been wakened from sleep. If the first thing that a person hears is the \r\n    word of Allaah in which there is all goodness, then these words will come to \r\n    his heart which is free form any distraction, and will thus have a great \r\n    impact on him. As for the day, the opposite is the case, so Qur&rsquo;aan is \r\n    recited silently unless there is a reason, such as the large gatherings on \r\n    Eid and Jumu&rsquo;ah (Friday), and when offering prayers for rain and the eclipse \r\n    prayer. On those occasions it is better to recite out loud and that is more \r\n    likely to achieve the objective and is more beneficial, and because this \r\n    serves to convey the words of Allaah when there is a large gathering.

It \r\n    is one of the major sins that doom a person and make his burden of sins \r\n    heavy on the Day of Resurrection, and it may lead him to Hell. We ask Allaah \r\n    to keep us safe and sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the gravest forms of wrongdoing and transgression is \r\n    consuming the wealth of weak people such as women and orphans, whom Allaah \r\n    has singled out for extra care and concern, and a sterner warning against \r\n    consuming their wealth, because the wrongdoers find it easier to take their \r\n    wealth because of their weak position.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When Allaah mentioned the shares of inheritance in Soorat \r\n    al-Nisa&rsquo;, He also warned the one who transgresses against this shar&rsquo;i \r\n    division of wealth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad\r\n    <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>), and transgresses \r\n    His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall \r\n    have a disgraceful torment&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:14]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah also listed consuming orphans&rsquo; wealth as a major sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And give unto orphans their property and do not exchange \r\n    (your) bad things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by \r\n    adding it) to your substance.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Whoever seizes a handspan of land unlawfully, he will be encircled by it \r\n    down through seven earths on the Day of Resurrection.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (3198) and Muslim (1610).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is strange indeed, by Allaah, to see someone who is keen \r\n    to offer prayers and do naafil acts of worship, but then you find that he \r\n    has fallen into sin by usurping people&rsquo;s rights, and he has taken on burdens \r\n    that mountains could not bear on the Day of Resurrection. His prayer, \r\n    fasting and reading Qur&rsquo;aan did not deter him from his greed and he did not \r\n    show mercy towards the weakness of women, children and orphans, so he \r\n    transgressed against the rights that Allaah has decreed for them, so after \r\n    that how could we hope for him to be saved.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our sister,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to reward you greatly for your keenness to save \r\n    your deceased grandfather from the punishment that you think is happening to \r\n    him, but we can do no more than remind you of the reality that Allaah has \r\n    stated in His Book, and that our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) has stated, that usurping land and consuming people&rsquo;s wealth \r\n    unlawfully, and transgressing against the shares of inheritance, are all \r\n    major sins, and if a man did not repent from them before he died (and \r\n    repentance includes restoring people&rsquo;s rights to them), if he did not repent \r\n    then he is exposed to the punishment of Allaah. Then when the Day of \r\n    Resurrection comes, those who had rights will take them from his hasanaat \r\n    (good deeds) to an extent commensurate with their rights. If his hasanaat \r\n    are all used up, then some of their sayi&rsquo;aat (bad deeds) will be taken and \r\n    added to his burden, then he will be thrown into the Fire, as the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us in his hadeeth \r\n    about the one who is bankrupt. Narrated by Muslim (2581).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your grandfather&rsquo;s repentance from usurping the orphan&rsquo;s land \r\n    that you mentioned is not sufficient, rather he should have told him the \r\n    truth of the matter and given him his rights in full.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Ghazaali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning \r\n    the conditions of repentance from transgressions against people:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He has to tell (his victim) the extent of his wrongdoing \r\n    before asking for forgiveness, because asking for forgiveness for something \r\n    that the victim is unaware of is not sufficient. Perhaps if the victim \r\n    realizes the extent of his transgression, he will not feel at ease with \r\n    forgiving him and he will keep that until the Day of Resurrection and he \r\n    will settle the score by taking from his hasanaat or giving him some of his \r\n    sayi&rsquo;aat.

Their saying that they &ldquo;will never \r\n    give their land to the people&rdquo; is very strange, because they know that it is \r\n    not their land or their father&rsquo;s land. What they should say, which is in \r\n    accordance with the truth, is &ldquo;We will carry on usurping the people&rsquo;s land&rdquo;. \r\n    We would think that neither they nor all the Muslims would knowingly expose \r\n    themselves to the punishment of Allaah, for the punishment of Allaah is \r\n    severe, and all the pleasures of this world are as nothing compared to a \r\n    moment in the fire of Hell.

There is a \r\n    difference between specifying when and specifying how.

The evidence for this is\r\n    the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;O Children of Adam!

The man&#146;s &#145;awrah is what I\r\n    have already described (i.e., from the navel to the knee), and all of a woman is &#145;awrah, apart from her\r\n    face and hands. The top of her feet is also &#145;awrah. If during prayer any part of the\r\n    area between a man&#146;s navel and knees becomes uncovered, or any part of a woman&#146;s\r\n    hair, whether it is a lot or a little, or any part of her body apart from her face and\r\n    hands and wrist &#150; and no more than that &#150; becomes uncovered, whether they\r\n    realize it or not, then both (man and woman) must repeat the prayer &#150; unless it was\r\n    uncovered by the wind, or it slipped and was immediately replaced without delay (no longer\r\n    than it takes to pick up the garment and place it back immediately.) (Al-Shaafa'i, <i>Kitaab\r\n    al-Umm<\/i>, <i>Baab Kayfiyyat Libs al-Thiyaab fi&#146;l-Salaah<\/i>). <\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book <i>al-Mughni<\/i>:\r\n    &#147;Section: if a little bit of the &#145;awrah becomes uncovered, this does not\r\n    invalidate the prayer. This is the opinion of Ahmad and Abu Haneefah. Al-Shaafa'i said:\r\n    &#145;It invalidates the prayer because it is a ruling that has to do with the\r\n    &#145;awrah, and it is the same whether it is a little or a lot, as is the case with\r\n    looking (at the &#145;awrah).&#146; We have what was reported by Abu Dawood, with his\r\n    isnaad from Ayyoob, from &#145;Amr ibn Salamah al-Jarmi, who said: &#145;My father went\r\n    with a group from his people to the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him), and he taught them how to pray. He said, &#147;The one who reads Qur&#146;aan\r\n    best among you should lead you in prayer.&#148; I was the best at reading Qur&#146;aan, so\r\n    they appointed me. I used to lead them in prayer wearing a small yellow burdah (cloak or\r\n    garment), and when I prostrated, my &#145;awrah became uncovered. One of the women said,\r\n    &#145;Cover the &#145;awrah of your reciter for us!&#146; so they bought me an Omani\r\n    shirt, and I never rejoiced over anything &#150; apart from Islam &#150; as much as I\r\n    rejoiced over that.&#146; Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Nasaa'i also reported from\r\n    &#145;Aasim al-Ahwal, from &#145;Amr ibn Salamah, who said: &#147;I used to lead them in\r\n    prayer wearing a burdah made of two attached parts in which there was a gap. When I\r\n    prostrated in it, my backside showed.&#146; This was common and was not denounced, and we\r\n    have not heard that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his\r\n    Companions denounced it, because if prayer is still valid despite a severe problem where\r\n    there is an excuse, then we should differentiate between whether the problem is severe or\r\n    not where there is no excuse; it is like the case of walking during the prayer. Avoiding\r\n    little matters may be too difficult, so a little is excused, as is the case with blood.\r\n    Once this is clear, the definition of a lot is that which is offensive to look at, and in\r\n    this case there is no differentiation between the private parts and other parts of the\r\n    &#145;awrah. A little is that which is not offensive, and the point of reference is that\r\n    which is customary, except that the two private parts are more offensive than anything\r\n    else, so that is considered to be an obstacle to prayer&#133; This is a matter in which\r\n    Islam did not define what is offensive, so the point of reference is what is customary, as\r\n    also applies in the case of excessive movement during the prayer&#133;&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If these holes show what is customarily regarded to be too much of the\r\n    &#145;awrah, and it shows it for a while, or it is not possible to cover them because the\r\n    garment is too small, for example, then the prayer is not valid, because covering the\r\n    &#145;awrah is one of the conditions of prayer, and if one of the conditions is not met\r\n    without a valid excuse such as inability to meet it, then the prayer is not valid. You\r\n    have to repeat the prayers which you did wearing this garment. If you do not know how many\r\n    they were, you should take what you are certain of. For example, if you think that they\r\n    may have been four or three or five, but definitely not more than five, then what you can\r\n    be certain of in this case is five, and so on.

This is \r\n    the view of Abu Qilaabah and Ahmad. However the majority of scholars say \r\n    that he does not have to repeat it.

Ibn al-Mundhir said: This is also my opinion. It is also the view \r\n    of Rabee&lsquo;ah and Maalik. The evidence for it is strong and it is the favoured \r\n    view.

This is the \r\n    correct view according to the majority of later scholars and was the view \r\n    favoured by the author [i.e., Ibn Qudaamah]&hellip; and Shaykh Taqiy ad-Deen [i.e., \r\n    Ibn Taymiyah]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second opinion says that his prayer is not valid and he \r\n    has to repeat it. And this is what we think is the correct view. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If (a person) prays with some impurity on his body, i.e., \r\n    some najaasah got on him and he did not wash it off, or there is some \r\n    impurity on his garment or in the place where he is praying, then his prayer \r\n    is not valid according to the majority of scholars. But if he was not aware \r\n    of this najaasah, or he was aware of it but then he forgot to wash it off \r\n    until he had completed his prayer, then his prayer is valid and he does not \r\n    have to repeat it. The evidence for that is that the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in prayer one day and took \r\n    his shoes off (whilst praying), and the people took their shoes off. When \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had finished the \r\n    prayer, he asked them why they had taken their shoes off and they said: We \r\n    saw you take off your shoes so we took off our shoes. He said: &ldquo;Jibreel came \r\n    to me and told me that there was some impurity on them.&rdquo; If the prayer was \r\n    to be deemed invalid because of the najaasah when he was unaware of it, then \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have started \r\n    the prayer all over&nbsp; again.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So avoiding impurities on the body and clothes and in the \r\n    place where one prays is one of the conditions of prayer being valid. But if \r\n    a person did not avoid impurity because he was unaware of it or because he \r\n    forgot, then his prayer is still valid whether he knew about it before he \r\n    prayed then forgot to wash it off, or he did not find out about it until \r\n    after he had prayed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you were to say: What is the difference between this and \r\n    one who prays without wudoo&rsquo; because he forgot or was unaware (of the \r\n    ruling), as the one who prays without wudoo&rsquo; because he forgot or was \r\n    unaware (of the ruling) was instructed to repeat it, but the one who prays \r\n    with some impurity because he forgot or was unaware (of it) is not \r\n    instructed to repeat it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our answer is: The difference between them is that wudoo&rsquo; or \r\n    ghusl come under the heading of doing something that is enjoined, whereas \r\n    avoiding impurity (najaasah) comes under the heading of refraining from \r\n    something that is prohibited. Failing to do something that is enjoined \r\n    cannot be excused&nbsp; on the grounds of ignorance or forgetting, unlike doing \r\n    something that is prohibited.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fa<\/i>taawa, 12\/390&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5147","question_id":"5147","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      If a Muslim is offering an obligatory prayer, he should not \r\n      interrupt it in order to answer the call of his father or mother.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described not praying as kufr, and he \r\n    said: &ldquo;The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives \r\n    it up is a kaafir.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2545) and by Ahmad and others; \r\n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is strange how the brother can say: I have tried not to \r\n    fall into sin,&rdquo; then he says that he missed a lot of prayer. What is his \r\n    concept of sin in that case?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Giving up prayer is the greatest and most serious sin. You \r\n    have tried to prevent yourself from doing every sin except associating \r\n    others with Allaah (shirk).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So hasten to repent and regret what you have done, before \r\n    there comes a moment when man regrets at the time when regret is to no \r\n    avail.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for you saying that you have a &ldquo;complex about prayer&rdquo; and \r\n    you feel that you will never recover from this complex, this is a trick of \r\n    the shaytaan who makes this idea seem attractive. You are the one who has \r\n    helped your enemy against yourself, and you let him fill your mind with the \r\n    idea of this complex which stems from illusions and laziness, and lack of \r\n    resolve to do good. So hasten to solve this problem by obeying Allaah, may \r\n    He be exalted, and keeping your wudoo&rsquo;, and hastening to pray when the time \r\n    for prayer begins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;The Shaytaan ties three knots at the back of the head of \r\n    any one of you when he goes to sleep, striking each knot and saying: &ldquo;You \r\n    have a long night ahead, so sleep.&rdquo; If he wakes up and remembers Allaah, one \r\n    knot is undone. If he does wudoo&rsquo;, two knots are undone. If he prays, all \r\n    the knots are undone, and he starts the day energetic and in a good mood. \r\n    Otherwise, he starts his day in a bad mood and feeling lazy.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3269) and Muslim (776).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him)said: This \r\n    hadeeth indicates that the shaytaan causes a person to sleep and makes him \r\n    feel heavy and lazy through his efforts and waswaas, and his ability to \r\n    tempt, mislead and make falsehood seem attractive, except the sincere slaves \r\n    of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth indicates that the shaytaan may be expelled by \r\n    means of remembrance of Allaah (dhikr), as well as wudoo&rsquo; and prayer. End \r\n    quote. <i>Al-Tahmeed<\/i> (19\/45).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    Undoubtedly prayer itself offers good health to the body, and helps the body \r\n    to rid itself of impurities and keep that which most beneficial thing for \r\n    it, as well as offering protection to one&rsquo;s faith and happiness in this \r\n    world and the hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, qiyaam al-layl is one of the most beneficial means \r\n    of protecting one&rsquo;s well being and preventing many chronic diseases, and it \r\n    is one of the most energizing things for the body, soul and heart, as it \r\n    says in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i>&hellip; and he quoted the hadeeth. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> (4\/225).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Do not feel weak before your enemy, and do not let him gain \r\n    any power over you. Seek the help of Allaah and do not feel helpless &ndash; as \r\n    your Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has enjoined \r\n    you. Remember that <i>&ldquo;ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaytaan (Satan)&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:76]<\/i>. Remember that the obligatory prayers are easy and the \r\n    Muslim will not find it burdensome to perform them regularly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what you mention about losing interest, the \r\n    reason for that may be the kind of people with whom you are keeping company. \r\n    Try as much as you can to attend gatherings of dhikr and knowledge, and to \r\n    sit with good companions, for acts of worship are easy when a person sees \r\n    others whom he can take as examples and who can help him with it. A person \r\n    will inevitably be exposed to situations which make him feel stronger and \r\n    more keen to do good, and other situations where that keenness will be less. \r\n    But it is not permissible to let that lead you to giving up obligatory \r\n    duties or committing haraam actions. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: <span>\r\n    &ldquo;Every deed has a period of enthusiasm, and every period of \r\n    enthusiasm is followed by a slackening off. If a person&rsquo;s enthusiasm is for \r\n    my Sunnah, then he has succeeded, but whoever chooses something else when he \r\n    slackens off is doomed.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (6725) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n    in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i> (no. 2151).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence our advice to you is to set a regular program for \r\n    yourself which you should not neglect, including the obligatory and \r\n    confirmed naafil prayers. If you do more than that occasionally that will be \r\n    good upon good, and if you fall short then do not fall short in doing the \r\n    obligatory prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the prayers that you have missed in the past, \r\n    whatever you missed because of sleep, there is no sin on you for that but \r\n    you have to make them up. As for those that you missed with no excuse, i.e., \r\n    you were too lazy to do them before the time for them ended, then you have \r\n    to repent, and in that case making them up will not avail you anything. What \r\n    you have to do is offer a lot of naafil prayers and pray for forgiveness, so \r\n    that Allaah may forgive you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have also discussed the words of the scholars in the \r\n    answer to question no.

If the Muslim was not able to acquire Islamic knowledge and \r\n    the rulings of sharee&lsquo;ah did not reach him, then he is not obliged to do \r\n    anything because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>All&acirc;h burdens not a person \r\n    beyond his scope<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:286]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no difference of opinion among the Muslims that if a \r\n    person was living in dar al-kufr (non-Muslim lands) and he believed but he \r\n    was unable to migrate (to a Muslim land), he is not obliged to observe \r\n    Islamic rituals and laws that he is unable to; rather he is only obliged to \r\n    do what he is able to. The same applies to matters concerning which he did \r\n    not know the rulings. If he did not know that prayer was obligatory for him \r\n    and he did not pray for a while, he does not have to make up those prayers \r\n    according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. This is the \r\n    view of Abu Haneefah and the literalists, and it is one of the two views of \r\n    the madhhab of Ahmad. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to all the other duties such as fasting the \r\n    month of Ramadan, paying zakaah, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he did not know that alcohol is haraam and he drank it, \r\n    then he is not to be subjected to the hadd punishment, according to Muslim \r\n    consensus. They only differed with regard to whether he has to make up the \r\n    prayers&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic issue with regard to all of this is: are the laws \r\n    obligatory for one who did not know them or is it the case that no one is \r\n    under any obligation until after he comes to know?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view concerning this matter is that there is no \r\n    obligation to adhere to a ruling unless there is the possibility of \r\n    acquiring knowledge thereof, and nothing has to be made up if it was not \r\n    known that it is obligatory. It is proven in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> that some of \r\n    the Sahaabah ate after dawn in Ramadan until they could tell the white \r\n    thread apart from the black thread, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) did not instruct them to make up those fasts. Some of \r\n    them used to remain in a state of janaabah (impurity following sexual \r\n    activity or nocturnal emissions for which ghusl or full ablution is \r\n    required) for a while and not pray; they did not know that it is permissible \r\n    to pray with tayammum (dry ablution) &ndash; as happened to Abu Dharr, &lsquo;Umar ibn \r\n    al-Khattaab and &lsquo;Ammaar. But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) did not instruct any of them to make up the prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    No doubt some Muslims in Makkah and in the wilderness \r\n    continued to pray facing towards Jerusalem until news reached them that that \r\n    had been abrogated (and the qiblah had been changed to the Ka&lsquo;bah), but they \r\n    were not instructed to repeat those prayers. And there are many similar \r\n    examples. This reflects the principle that the early generation and the \r\n    majority of scholars followed, namely that <span>Allah \r\n    burdens not a person beyond his scope<\/span>. Things are only obligatory \r\n    when one is able to do them, and the punishment only applies when one fails \r\n    to do something that is enjoined or does something that is forbidden, after \r\n    proof has been established.

But if this person who has missed an obligatory prayer starts to pray \r\n    again before the &lsquo;iddah is over, he comes back to Islam and his marriage \r\n    continues.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your question does not suggest that either of you stopped \r\n    praying for a long time that would include the &lsquo;iddah period, rather at the \r\n    most you did not pray sometimes, then you went back to praying.

As for one who prays sometimes, he is not a kaafir \r\n    because the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Between a man and kufr and shirk there stands his giving up prayer.&rdquo; He did \r\n    not say &ldquo;giving up a prayer&rdquo; (<i>tarku salaatin<\/i>) rather he said &ldquo;giving \r\n    up [the] prayer&rdquo; (<i>tark al-salaah<\/i>). This implies not praying \r\n    altogether. Similarly he said: &ldquo;The covenant that distinguishes between us \r\n    and them is prayer; whoever does not pray is a kaafir.&rdquo; Based on that we \r\n    say: The one who prays sometimes and does not pray sometimes is not a \r\n    kaafir. End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> (12\/55).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But he was asked about one who only prays Jumu&rsquo;ah (Friday \r\n    prayer) and he replied: He only prays Jumu&rsquo;ah?

So he prays Jumu&rsquo;ah out of habit and he \r\n    gets dressed and makes himself look good and puts on perfume and goes. Even \r\n    if I do not think that anyone is a kaafir except the one who does not pray \r\n    at all, I would still have doubts about this man&rsquo;s Islam, because he is \r\n    taking Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer as a special occasion only, and he dresses up and goes \r\n    to meet people, when he is wearing perfume and dressed up. I doubt whether \r\n    he is still Muslim. According to the opinion of our Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez he \r\n    is a kaafir.

And all of that has a negative effect on one's mental attitude.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah \r\n    knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5161","question_id":"5161","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If prayers have been missed, one of the following three \r\n    scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The prayer was missed for a reason such as sleeping or \r\n    forgetting. In that case it must be made up, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever forgets a prayer or \r\n    sleeps and misses it, the expiation for that is to pray it when he \r\n    remembers.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 572; Muslim, 684.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should offer these prayers in order as enjoined, because \r\n    of the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah, according to which &lsquo;Umar ibn \r\n    al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) came on the day of al-Khandaq \r\n    after the sun had set, and started cursing the kuffaar of Quraysh and \r\n    saying, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I could hardly pray &lsquo;Asr until the sun had \r\n    almost set.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;By Allaah, I did not pray it either.&rdquo; We went to Bat-haan and he did \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; for prayer and so did we, then he prayed &lsquo;Asr after the sun had set, \r\n    then he prayed Maghrib after that. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (571) and Muslim \r\n    (631).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; He omitted the prayer for a reason but he was not aware \r\n    of it, such as unconsciousness. In this case the prayer is waived for him \r\n    and he does not have to make it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I was involved in a car accident and I stayed in the hospital \r\n    for three months, where I did not wake up and I did not pray for all that \r\n    time.

One of two scenarios \r\n    applies in this case:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Either he denied and \r\n    refused to accept that they are obligatory. In this case there is no dispute \r\n    that this is kufr and he has nothing to do with Islam. He has to enter Islam \r\n    and then do all the duties and obligations of Islam, but he does not have to \r\n    make up the prayers he missed when he was a kaafir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or he did not pray because he was negligent and lazy. In this \r\n    case the prayers are not valid if he makes them up, because he had no excuse \r\n    at the time when he missed them. Allaah has enjoined prayers at certain, \r\n    clearly-defined times, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, As&#8209;Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the \r\n    believers at fixed hours&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:103]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action \r\n    that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari, 2697; Muslim, 1718.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I did not pray until the age of twenty-four.

Rather he has to repent to \r\n    Allaah, because prayer is the foundation of Islam, and failing to pray is \r\n    the greatest of sins. In fact, failing to pray constitutes major kufr \r\n    according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because it is \r\n    narrated that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; \r\n    whoever does not pray is a kaafir.&rdquo; Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the authors \r\n    of <i>al-Sunan<\/i> with a saheeh isnaad from Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up \r\n    prayer.&rdquo; Narrated by Imam Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> from Jaabir ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him). And there are other ahaadeeth \r\n    which indicate the same thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you have to do is repent sincerely to Allaah by \r\n    regretting what you have done in the past, giving up not praying, and \r\n    sincerely resolving not to go back to it. You do not have to make up \r\n    anything, either with every prayer or otherwise. Rather all you have to do \r\n    is repent. Praise be to Allaah, whoever repents, Allaah accepts his \r\n    repentance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O \r\n    believers, that you may be successful&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:31]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The one who repents from \r\n    sin is like one who did not sin at all.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to be sincere in your repentance, and take stock of \r\n    yourself, and strive to offer prayers regularly on time in congregation.

When a kaafir \r\n    becomes Muslim, he is not obliged to make up acts of worship that he did not \r\n    do when he was a kaafir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you did not fast at a time when you were praying, then \r\n    one of the following two scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Either you did not form the intention to fast from the night \r\n    before, and you decided rather that you would not fast. In this case making \r\n    up the fasts would not be valid in your case, because you failed to do the \r\n    act of worship at the time prescribed for it by Islam, with no excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or you started to fast then you broke the fast during the \r\n    day. In this case you have to make it up, because when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the one who had had \r\n    intercourse during the day in Ramadaan to offer expiation for that, he said \r\n    to him: &ldquo;Fast one day in its stead.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2393; Ibn \r\n    Maajah, 1671; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Irwa&rsquo; al-Ghaleel<\/i>, \r\n    940.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked about the ruling on breaking the fast during the day in Ramadaan with \r\n    no excuse. He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Breaking the fast during the day in Ramadaan with no excuse \r\n    is a major sin, which makes a person a faasiq (disobedient, evildoer) who \r\n    has to repent to Allaah and make up the day when he broke his fast. I.e., if \r\n    he fasted then during the day he broke his fast with no excuse, then he has \r\n    sinned, and he has to make up the day when he broke the fast, because when \r\n    he started it, it became binding upon him, so he has to make it up, like a \r\n    vow. But if he did not fast at all, deliberately, with no excuse, then it is \r\n    most likely that he does not have to make it up, because that will not \r\n    benefit him at all, for it will never be accepted from him. The basic \r\n    principle with regard to every act of worship which is to be done at a \r\n    specific time is that if it is delayed beyond that time with no excuse, it \r\n    will not be accepted, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does any action that is not in accordance \r\n    with this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo; And he has transgressed the \r\n    limits set by Allaah, and transgressing the limits set by Allaah is zulm \r\n    (wrongdoing), and good deeds are not accepted from the wrongdoer. Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, \r\n    then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:229]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he had done this act \r\n    of worship ahead of time &ndash; i.e., before the time for it began &ndash; it would not \r\n    have been accepted of him, and by the same token, if he does it after that \r\n    it will not be accepted from him, unless he has an excuse.

There are reasons why a Muslim may be excused and not \r\n    judged to be a kaafir, for example: ignorance, misunderstanding, being \r\n    forced, and making mistakes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to the first, a man may be ignorant of the ruling of Allaah, because he \r\n    lives far from the Muslim lands, such as one who grows up in the desert or \r\n    in a kaafir land, or has only recently come to Islam. This may include many \r\n    of those Muslims who live in societies where ignorance prevails and \r\n    knowledge is scarce. These are the ones concerning whom the questioner is \r\n    confused as to whether they are to be judged as kaafirs and executed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second \r\n    reason is if a person interprets the ruling of Allaah in a manner not \r\n    intended by the Lawgiver, such as those who blindly follow the people of \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) in their misinterpretations, such as the Murji&rsquo;ah, \r\n    Mu&rsquo;tazilah, Khawaarij and the like.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The third \r\n    reason is if an oppressor overwhelms a Muslim and will not let him go until \r\n    he makes a blatant statement of kufr out loud in order to ward off the \r\n    torture, when his heart is at ease with faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fourth \r\n    is when words of kufr come to one's lips without meaning it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Not everyone \r\n    who is ignorant about wudoo&rsquo; and prayer can be excused, when he seed the \r\n    Muslims establishing prayer and praying regularly, and he can read and hear \r\n    the verses on prayer.

Rather \r\n    he should be asked to repent and he should be offered the opportunity to \r\n    return to Islam and resolve his doubts, if he has any doubts. Then if he \r\n    persists in his apostasy after that, he is to be put to death.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah \r\n    said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 9\/18:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The apostate \r\n    should not be put to death until he has been asked to repent three times. \r\n    This is the view of the majority of scholars, including &lsquo;Umar, &lsquo;Ali, &lsquo;Ata&rsquo;, \r\n    al-Nakhaii, Maalik, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa&rsquo;i, Ishaaq and others. Because \r\n    apostasy comes about because of doubt, and cannot be dispelled in an \r\n    instant. Time should be allowed for the person to rethink the matter, and \r\n    the best length of time is three days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The saheeh \r\n    Sunnah indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari \r\n    (6922) narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever changes his religion, \r\n    put him to death.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari \r\n    (6484) and Muslim (1676) narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that \r\n    there is no god except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah, except \r\n    in one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., in the case of murder); a \r\n    previously-married person who commits zina; and one who leaves his religion \r\n    and separates from the main body of the Muslims.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The general \r\n    meaning of these ahaadeeth indicates that it is essential to put the \r\n    apostate to death whether he is waging war on Islam (muhaarib) or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The view \r\n    that the apostate who is to be put to death is the one who is waging war on \r\n    Islam (muhaarib) only is contrary to these ahaadeeth. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the reason why he \r\n    should be put to death is his apostasy, not his waging war against Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Undoubtedly \r\n    some kinds of apostasy are more abhorrent than others, and the apostasy of \r\n    one who wages war against Islam is more abhorrent than that of anyone else. \r\n    Hence some of the scholars differentiated between them, and said that it is \r\n    not essential to ask the muhaarib to repent or to accept his repentance; \r\n    rather he should be put to death even if he repents, whereas the repentance \r\n    of one who is not a muhaarib should be accepted and he should not be put to \r\n    death. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Apostasy is of two types: ordinary apostasy \r\n    and extreme apostasy, for which execution is prescribed. In both cases there \r\n    is evidence that it is essential to execute the apostate, but the evidence \r\n    indicating that the sentence of death may be waived if the person repents \r\n    does not apply to both types of apostasy. Rather the evidence indicates that \r\n    that is allowed only in the first case &ndash; i.e., ordinary apostasy &ndash; as will \r\n    be clear to anyone who studies the evidence that speaks about accepting the \r\n    repentance of the apostate. In the second type &ndash; i.e., extreme apostasy &ndash; \r\n    the obligation to put the apostate to death still stands, and there is no \r\n    text or scholarly consensus to indicate that the death sentence may be \r\n    waived. The two cases are quite different and there is no comparison between \r\n    them. It does not say in the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah, or according to scholarly \r\n    consensus, that everyone who apostatizes in word or deed may be spared the \r\n    death sentence if he repents after he is a captured and tried.

Do not let him slaughter the meat for you himself, and tell him the \r\n    reason why, which is that the one who does not pray is regarded as a kaafir, \r\n    so meat slaughtered by him is not halaal.

This is the correct view, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Between a man and shirk and kufr \r\n    there stands his giving up prayer.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from \r\n    Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him). And the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The covenant \r\n    that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever does not pray is a \r\n    kaafir.&rdquo; Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the four authors of <i>Sunan<\/i> with a \r\n    saheeh isnaad from Buraydah ibn al-Husayb (may Allaah be pleased with him). \r\n    And he said: &ldquo;The head of the matter is Islam and its pillar is prayer.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Imam Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi with a saheeh isnaad from Mu&rsquo;aadh ibn \r\n    Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him). If the pillar of a thing falls, it \r\n    cannot stand straight or remain; when the pillar falls, whatever rests on it \r\n    falls too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it is known that the one who does not pray has no \r\n    religion, so meat slaughtered by him cannot be eaten. If you are living in a \r\n    land where there are no Muslim butchers, you should laughter your own meat \r\n    and use your hands to do something that will be benefit to you, or look for \r\n    a Muslim butcher to slaughter meat for you even in his own house. Praise be \r\n    to Allaah, this is something easy so you should not be heedless about this \r\n    matter. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should advise this man to fear Allaah and pray. His \r\n    suggestion that the Shahaadatayn is sufficient is a serious mistake, because \r\n    the Shahaadatayn come with conditions that must be fulfilled, as the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I have been ordered \r\n    to fight the people until they bear witness that there is no god except \r\n    Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah, and establish regular prayer \r\n    and pay zakaah. If they do that, then their blood and wealth are safe from \r\n    me, except in cases dictated by Islamic law, and their reckoning will be \r\n    with Allaah.&rdquo; Saheeh &ndash;&nbsp; agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So prayer and zakaah are mentioned alongside the \r\n    Shahaadatayn. According to another version: &ldquo;I have been commanded to fight \r\n    the people until they say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, and if they say Laa ilaaha \r\n    ill-Allaah, then their blood and wealth are safe from me, except in cases \r\n    dictated by Islamic law, and their reckoning will be with Allaah.&rdquo; Prayer is \r\n    one of these conditions and zakaah is one of these conditions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the believer must do is fear Allaah, and everyone who \r\n    claims to be a Muslim must fear Allaah and offer the five prayers regularly, \r\n    for prayer is the foundation of Islam and it is the greatest of the five \r\n    pillars of Islam after the Shahaadatayn. Whoever neglects it neglects his \r\n    religious commitment, and whoever does not pray has left the faith. We ask \r\n    Allaah to keep us safe and sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the truth and this is what is correct. Some of the \r\n    scholars said that such a person is not a kaafir in the sense of major kufr, \r\n    rather his kufr is minor kufr, and he is a sinner who has committed a grave \r\n    sin, one that is worse than adultery, worse than stealing, worse than \r\n    drinking alcohol. But he is not a kaafir in the sense of major kufr unless \r\n    he denies that prayer is obligatory. This is the view of a number of \r\n    scholars. But the correct view is that which is indicated by the words of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is that \r\n    such a person is a kaafir in the sense of major kufr, as stated in the \r\n    ahaadeeth quoted above, because he has neglected the pillar or foundation of \r\n    Islam which is prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We should not take this matter lightly. &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    Shaqeeq al-&lsquo;Aqeeli, the great Taabi&rsquo;i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;The companions of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) did not regard the omission of anything as being kufr, except in the \r\n    case of prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And he mentioned that the \r\n    Sahaabah were unanimously agreed that the one who did not pray was a kaafir \r\n    in their view. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So we must be careful, and adhere to this important \r\n    obligation and not take the matter lightly if someone does not pray. We \r\n    should not eat meat slaughtered by him, or invite him to any feasts, or \r\n    accept his invitations. Rather he should be shunned until he repents to \r\n    Allaah and starts to pray. We ask Allaah to guide us all.

Moreover it is not \r\n    permissible for a chaste woman to remain married to an immoral adulterer. \r\n    His not praying dictates that the marriage contract should be annulled; as \r\n    for his committing immoral actions, it does not dictate that the marriage \r\n    contract be annulled, but her acceptance of his actions makes her a partner \r\n    with him in them.

What is meant here by kufr or disbelief is the kind of kufr which puts a person\r\n    beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    made prayer the dividing line between the believers and the disbelievers. It is known that\r\n    the community of kufr is not the same as the community of Islam, so whoever does not\r\n    fulfil this covenant must be one of the kaafireen (disbelievers).<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is also the hadeeth of &lsquo;Awf ibn Maalik (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him), according to which the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said: &ldquo;The best of your leaders are those whom you love and who love you, who\r\n    pray for you and you pray for them. The worst of your leaders are those whom you hate and\r\n    who hate you, and you send curses on them and they send curses on you.&rdquo; He was asked,\r\n    &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, should we not fight them by the sword?&rdquo; He said,\r\n    &ldquo;Not as long as they are establishing prayer amongst you.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This hadeeth indicates that those in authority should be opposed and\r\n    fought if they do not establish prayer, but it is not permissible to oppose and fight them\r\n    unless they make a blatant show of kufr and we have evidence from Allaah that what they\r\n    are doing is indeed kufr. &lsquo;Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called us and we gave bay&rsquo;ah (oath of\r\n    allegiance) to him. Among the things that we pledged to do was to listen and obey him both\r\n    when we felt enthusiastic and when we were disinclined to act, both at times of difficulty\r\n    and times of ease, and at times when others were given preference over us, and that we\r\n    would not oppose those in authority. He said: &lsquo;unless they made a blatant show of\r\n    kufr and you have evidence from Allaah that what they are doing is indeed\r\n    kufr.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Agreed upon). On this basis, their neglecting the\r\n    prayer, for which the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said we should\r\n    oppose them and fight them by the sword, constitutes an act of blatant kufr for which we\r\n    have evidence from Allaah that it is indeed kufr.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If someone were to say: is it not permissible to interpret the texts\r\n    about a person who neglects prayer being a kaafir as referring to the one who neglects the\r\n    prayer because he does not think it is obligatory?<\/p>\r\n    <p>We would say: it is not permissible to interpret the texts in this way\r\n    because there are two reservations about this interpretation:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>it involves ignoring the general description that the Lawgiver took into\r\n        consideration and to which the ruling was connected. The ruling that the person who\r\n        neglects prayer is a kaafir is connected to the action of neglecting prayer, not to his\r\n        denial of it being obligatory. Brotherhood in religion is based on performing the prayer,\r\n        not on whether a person declares it to be obligatory. Allaah did not say, &ldquo;If they\r\n        repent and state that the prayer is obligatory&rdquo;, and the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not say &ldquo;Between a man and shirk and kufr there\r\n        stands his denial that the prayer is obligatory&rdquo; or &ldquo;The covenant that\r\n        distinguishes between us and them is our statement that the prayer is obligatory, so\r\n        whoever denies that it is obligatory has disbelieved.&rdquo; If this is what Allaah and His\r\n        Messenger had meant, then not stating it clearly would have contradicted what is said in\r\n        the Qur&rsquo;aan. For Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <i><p>&ldquo;And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&rsquo;aan) as an\r\n      exposition of everything&rdquo; [al-Nahl 16:89]<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder\r\n      and the advice (i.e. the Qur&rsquo;aan)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent\r\n      down to them&rdquo; [al-Nahl 16:44]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i>\r\n      <li><p>It is not correct to refer to a reason which the Lawgiver did not make a\r\n        factor in ruling a person to be a kaafir, because if a person who does not have the excuse\r\n        of ignorance denies that the five daily prayers are obligatory then he is deemed to be a\r\n        kaafir, whether he prays or not. If a person performs the five daily prayers, fulfilling\r\n        all the conditions of prayer and doing all the actions that are obligatory or mustahabb,\r\n        but he denies that the prayers are obligatory with no valid reason for doing so, then he\r\n        is a kaafir, even though he is not neglecting the prayers. From this it is clear that it\r\n        is not correct to interpret the texts about neglecting the prayers as referring to denying\r\n        that they are obligatory. The correct view is that the person who neglects the prayer is a\r\n        kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, as is clearly stated in the report narrated by Ibn\r\n        Abi Haatim in his <i>Sunan<\/i> from &lsquo;Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased\r\n        with him), who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n        him) exhorted us: &lsquo;Do not associate anything in worship with Allaah, and do not\r\n        neglect the prayer deliberately, for whoever neglects the prayer deliberately puts himself\r\n        beyond the pale of Islam.&rdquo; Moreover, if we interpret the ahaadeeth about neglecting\r\n        the prayer as referring to a denial that it is obligatory, there would be no point in the\r\n        reports referring specifically to the prayer, because this ruling applies equally to\r\n        zakaah, fasting and Hajj &ndash; whoever neglects any of these, denying that it is\r\n        obligatory, is a kaafir, if he does not have the excuse of ignorance.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Just as the one who neglects the prayer is deemed to be a kaafir on the\r\n    basis of the evidence of the texts and reports, so he may also be deemed to be a kaafir on\r\n    the basis of rational analysis. How can a person be a believer if he neglects the prayer\r\n    which is the pillar of religion, and when there are aayaat and ahaadeeth urging us to\r\n    perform prayer which make the wise believer rush to do the prayer, and when there are\r\n    aayaat and ahaadeeth warning against neglecting it, which make the wise believer scared to\r\n    ignore the prayer? Once we have understood this, a person cannot be a believer if he\r\n    neglects the prayer.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person were to say: can we not interpret kufr in the case of one\r\n    who neglects the prayer as meaning a lesser form of kufr (<i>kufr al-na&rsquo;mah<\/i>)\r\n    rather than the kind of kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam (<i>kufr\r\n    al-millah<\/i>)? Or can we not interpret it as being less than Kufr Akbar (major kufr) and\r\n    more like the kufr referred to in the ahaadeeth, &ldquo;There are two qualities that exist\r\n    among people which are qualities of kufr: slandering people&rsquo;s lineage and wailing\r\n    over the dead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trading insults with a Muslim is <i>fisq<\/i> (immoral\r\n    conduct) and exchanging blows with him is kufr&rdquo;, etc.?<\/p>\r\n    <p>We would say that this interpretation is not correct for a number of\r\n    reasons:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made prayer the\r\n        dividing line between kufr and faith, between the believer and the disbeliever. This is\r\n        where he drew the line, and the two things are quite distinct and do not overlap.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Prayer is one of the pillars of Islam, so when the person who neglects\r\n        it is described as a kaafir, this implies the kind of kufr that puts a person beyond the\r\n        pale of Islam, because he has destroyed one of the pillars of Islam. This is a different\r\n        matter from attributing kufr to a person who does one of the actions of kufr.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>There are other texts which indicate that the kufr of the one who\r\n        neglects the prayer is the kind of kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, so\r\n        what is meant here by kufr should be interpreted according to the apparent meaning, so as\r\n        avoid contradictions between the texts.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The description of kufr in those ahaadeeth is different. Concerning\r\n        neglecting the prayer, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n        &ldquo;Between a man and shirk and kufr.&rdquo; Here the word kufr is preceded in the\r\n        original Arabic by the definite article &ldquo;al&rdquo;, which indicates that what is\r\n        referred to here is the reality of kufr. This is in contrast to the other ahaadeeth where\r\n        kufr is referred to without the definite article, or in a verbal form, which indicates\r\n        that this is a part of kufr or that the person has disbelieved by doing this action, but\r\n        it is not the absolute kufr which places a person beyond the pale of Islam.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book <i>Iqtidaa&rsquo;\r\n    al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem<\/i> (p. 70, Al-Sunnah Al-Muhammadiyyah edn.),\r\n    concerning the hadeeth of the Messenger <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    &ldquo;&ldquo;There are two qualities that exist among people which are qualities of\r\n    kufr&rdquo;:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;The phrase &lsquo;which are qualities of kufr&rsquo; means that\r\n    these two qualities which exist among people are qualities of kufr because they are among\r\n    the deeds of kufr and they exist among people. But not everyone who has a part of kufr\r\n    becomes a kaafir because of it, unless there exists in his heart the reality of kufr.\r\n    Similarly, not everyone who has a part of faith becomes a believer because of it, unless\r\n    there exists in his heart the essential reality of faith. So there is a distinction\r\n    between kufr that is preceded [in the original Arabic] by the definite article\r\n    &ldquo;al&rdquo;, as in the hadeeth &lsquo;Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands\r\n    nothing but his neglecting the prayer&rsquo;, and kufr that is not preceded by the definite\r\n    article but is used in an affirmative sense.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So it is clear that the person who neglects the prayer with no excuse\r\n    is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, on the basis of this evidence. This is the\r\n    correct view according to Imaam Ahmad, and it is one of the two opinions narrated from\r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, as was mentioned by Ibn Katheer in his tafseer of the aayah\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up\r\n    As-Salaat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not\r\n    offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper\r\n    fixed times] and have followed lusts&rdquo; [Maryam 19:59]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in his book <i>Al-Salaah<\/i> that it was one of\r\n    the two views narrated from al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, and that al-Tahhaawi narrated it from\r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i himself.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This was also the view of the majority of the Sahaabah, indeed many\r\n    narrated that there was consensus among the Sahaabah on this point. &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn\r\n    Shaqeeq said: the companions of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    did not think that neglecting any deed made a person a kaafir, apart from neglecting the\r\n    prayer. This was reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh according\r\n    to the conditions of (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, the well known imaam,\r\n    said, It was reported with a saheeh isnaad from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) that the one who neglects the prayer is a kaafir. This was also the\r\n    view of the scholars from the time of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) until the present day: that the person who deliberately neglects the prayer with no\r\n    valid excuse, until the time for that prayer is over, is a kaafir. Ibn Hazm said that it\r\n    was reported from &lsquo;Umar, &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf, Mu&rsquo;aadh ibn Jabal,\r\n    Abu Hurayrah and others among the Sahaabah. He said: &ldquo;We do not know of any opposing\r\n    view among the Sahaabah.&rdquo; Al-Mundhiri narrated this from him in <i>Al-Targheeb\r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Tarheeb<\/i>, and added more names of Sahaabah: &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn\r\n    Mas&rsquo;ood, &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah and\r\n    Abu&rsquo;l-Dardaa&rsquo; &ndash; may Allaah be pleased with them.

Some of them say that he is\r\n    definitely a kaafir who has gone beyond the pale of Islam. He is considered to be a <i>murtadd<\/i>\r\n    (apostate) who is to be given three days to repent &ndash; if he does not, he is to be\r\n    executed for his apostasy. The funeral prayer will not be recited over him, and he will\r\n    not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. The greeting of salaam is not to be given to him,\r\n    in life or in death, and his greeting is not to be returned; prayers for forgiveness and\r\n    mercy for him cannot be offered; he cannot inherit, neither can his wealth be inherited,\r\n    instead it is to be given to the Muslim treasury (<i>bayt al-maal<\/i>). This ruling\r\n    applies whether the number of people who are neglecting their prayers are many or a few.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This opinion is the soundest and most correct, because of the words of\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The difference between\r\n    us and them is salaah. Whoever neglects it is a kaafir.&rdquo; (Reported by Imaam\r\n    Ahmad and the authors of <i>Sunan<\/i> with a saheeh isnaad); and:\r\n    &ldquo;(Nothing stands) between a man and kufr and shirk, except prayer: (whoever neglects\r\n    it becomes a kaafir and a mushrik).&rdquo; (Reported by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh,\r\n    with other similar ahaadeeth).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The majority of scholars said that if a person denies\r\n    that prayer is obligatory, he is a kaafir and an apostate from the religion of Islam.

If he does not deny that it is\r\n    obligatory, but he neglects it because of laziness, for example, then he is guilty of a\r\n    major sin (<i>kabeerah<\/i>), but he is not considered to be beyond the pale of Islam. He\r\n    should be given three days in which to repent. If he does, then al-hamdu lillah (praise be\r\n    to Allaah); if he does not, then he should be executed, but this is a punishment, not\r\n    because he became a kaafir. In this case, he should be washed (<i>ghusl<\/i>, after death)\r\n    and wrapped in a shroud (<i>kafn<\/i>). The funeral prayer should be offered for him,\r\n    prayers can be offered for forgiveness and mercy for him, and he should be buried in the\r\n    Muslim graveyard. He can inherit and be inherited from.

The majority of them \r\n    said that he should be asked to repent, and if he repents all well and good, \r\n    otherwise he is to be executed as a hadd punishment. Others said that he \r\n    should be given a disciplinary punishment (ta&rsquo;zeer) and imprisoned until he \r\n    starts to pray. So there are three opinions concerning this issue:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The first opinion: that the one who does not pray is a \r\n    kaafir, without differentiating between the one who denies it and the one \r\n    who is lazy. This is the view of the Sahaabah, and no difference of opinion \r\n    is known among them. Among those who hold this view are: Imam Ahmad (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) according to the more correct of the two opinions \r\n    narrated from him, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and Mansoor \r\n    al-Faqeeh among the Shaafa&rsquo;is. It was also narrated from Abu&rsquo;l-Tayyib ibn \r\n    Salamah among the Shaafa&rsquo;is.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second opinion: that the one who does not pray because he \r\n    is lazy and heedless, not because he denies it, is one of the evildoers \r\n    among the Muslims, but he is not a kaafir. However, he should be asked to \r\n    repent -- although they differed concerning the time that should be allowed \r\n    for that -- then if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he is to be \r\n    executed as a hadd punishment! Like the married adulterer, but he should be \r\n    executed with the sword. This is the view of Maalik and his companions, and \r\n    it is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and most of his companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The view that someone like this should be executed as a hadd \r\n    punishment is subject to further discussion. We have explained the error of \r\n    this opinion in the answer to question number\r\n    [fatin]6035[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third opinion: that the person who does not pray \r\n    deliberately, because he is lazy and heedless, although he acknowledges that \r\n    it is obligatory, is not a kaafir and should not be executed, rather he \r\n    should be given a disciplinary punishment (ta&rsquo;zeer) and imprisoned until he \r\n    begins to pray.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of Imam Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) and his companions, and of a number of the people of Kufah, Sufyaan \r\n    al-Thawri, and of al-Mazani the companion of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, but it is the \r\n    weakest of the opinions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Many practical rulings are based on the difference in opinion \r\n    on the ruling on one who does not pray, such as: whether he inherits, \r\n    inheritance from him, whether he is to be washed and buried in the Muslim \r\n    graveyard, whether the funeral prayer is to be offered for him, ruling on \r\n    meat slaughtered or hunted by him, whether his marriage remains valid and \r\n    other rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For those who say that the one who does not pray is a kaafir \r\n    -- even if he does not deny it is obligatory -- all the rulings on apostates \r\n    apply to him. So he cannot inherit or be inherited from, he cannot be washed \r\n    (after he dies), he cannot be buried in the Muslim graveyard, the funeral \r\n    prayer cannot be offered for him, meat slaughtered by him is not halaal and \r\n    his marriage contract becomes invalid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For those who ruled that he is not a kaafir, the rulings \r\n    mentioned above do not apply to him; rather he is regarded as an evildoer \r\n    among the Muslims and one who is committing a major sin, but the majority of \r\n    them say that he should be asked to repent, then if he does not pray, he is \r\n    to be executed as a hadd punishment! Similarly -- in their view -- if he is \r\n    married to a Christian or Jewish woman, then his marriage contract is deemed \r\n    to be valid, and is the marriage contract between a Muslim man and a woman \r\n    from the People of the Book.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The more correct of these two opinions is the first one, \r\n    because of the apparent meaning of the evidence from the Qur'aan and Sunnah, \r\n    and because of the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them) concerning that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what was stated in fatwas by shaykhs such as: \r\n    Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz, Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen, the scholars of the Standing Committee and others, despite \r\n    the difference of opinion concerning the hadd punishment which the one who \r\n    does not pray is thought to deserve.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that: the marriage contract between this man and \r\n    that woman is a marriage contract between an apostate and the Christian \r\n    woman -- if she is still following her religion -- and her situation is less \r\n    serious than his, because she is a woman of the People of the Book, whilst \r\n    he is an apostate from his religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answers to questions number\r\n    [fatin]2182[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]5208[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]33007[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]10094[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the woman asked about, if she has become \r\n    Muslim, it is not permissible for her to stay with a man who does not pray. \r\n    The ruling on that has been discussed above in detail.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if she is still a nonbeliever, then their are no rulings \r\n    that have to do with her marriage to him, because they are both not Muslim. \r\n    Neither of them is Muslim so that the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah would apply to \r\n    their marriage.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We advise her to leave this man and marry a man who is really \r\n    a Muslim. Because he does not pray, he is not regarded as a Muslim, and the \r\n    evils and sins that he commits are not part of the Muslim&rsquo;s attitude. \r\n    Moreover, as seems to be the case to us from the question, he is lacking in \r\n    chivalry and decency, because he agrees to his wife going out to work and \r\n    bearing the burden of earning a living, whilst he sits at home. By Allaah, \r\n    his attitude would be wrong even if he were staying home to read Qur'aan and \r\n    pray, whilst his wife goes out to work and support him, so what should we \r\n    say about him when he is staying home to commit sin and evil?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we say to this wife is: O female slave of Allaah, do not \r\n    look at the religion on the basis of its people or on the basis of one of \r\n    them; rather look at what there is in it of truth, goodness, honesty and \r\n    righteousness. As for the people, if your husband is as you describe, then \r\n    among the Muslims there are people who adhere to its etiquette, rulings and \r\n    morals and manners apart from this man. There are still people, among both \r\n    Muslims and non-Muslims, who are sincere, righteous and decent, and there \r\n    are some who are not like that. But the attitude of the Muslim, if he still \r\n    follows his religion properly is more sublime and more righteous and purer \r\n    than the attitude of others. Think about it and you will find that this is \r\n    true. Remember that most of the Muslims around you are interested in worldly \r\n    gains and greed, and they have gone against the rulings of their religion \r\n    which forbid living in the lands of the kuffaar for the sake of worldly \r\n    gains and greed, so what kind of attitude do you expect from them? Very few \r\n    of them adhere to the commands of their religion, or they are living there \r\n    for a reason which makes that permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    O female slave of Allaah, hasten and do not delay; do not let \r\n    people and their attitudes be a barrier between you and light from your \r\n    Lord. Every soul is a pledge for that which it has earned, and people will \r\n    be called to account on the Day of Resurrection one by one, and no soul will \r\n    bear the burden of another: it will get what it deserves, good or bad. So \r\n    come to the light that you have seen, and beware of delaying, lest darkness \r\n    overwhelm you and the light of guidance disappear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If there is something that is keeping you away from the \r\n    light, remove it from your eyes no matter what it is, and hasten towards \r\n    your Lord on His straight path.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5191","question_id":"5191","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Meat slaughtered by one who does not pray is not halaal, \r\n    whether he says the name of Allaah over it or not.

It is well known that if the condition is not met, \r\n    the thing is invalid, so if the name of Allaah is not mentioned, the meat is \r\n    not halaal, as with any other condition. Hence if a person prays but he \r\n    forgot to do wudoo&rsquo;, he has to repeat the prayer. Similarly if he prays not \r\n    realizing that he had broken his wudoo&rsquo; because he thought that breaking \r\n    wind does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, or that eating camel meat does not \r\n    invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, for example, then he must repeat it, because the thing is \r\n    not valid without the conditions being met. So if he slaughtered it but the \r\n    blood did not flow, by mistake or out of ignorance, then it is not halaal, \r\n    and the same applies if he does not mention the name of Allaah, because it \r\n    is mentioned in the same hadeeth.

So he should not be content with what she shows or what he thinks \r\n    from her outward appearance or from a few events. If he tries hard to check \r\n    and ask, then it becomes clear that she is different from what he expected, \r\n    this is the matter of the divine decree and has nothing to do with him, and \r\n    in that case he needs to see the best way to deal with the situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The matter of religious commitment is a relative matter. When \r\n    it comes to details, some people want the level of religious commitment that \r\n    suits them, such as striving hard to offer naafil fasts, pray qiyaam \r\n    al-layl, memorize the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan or a specific portion of it, or have some \r\n    shar&lsquo;i knowledge, etc. Others may vary in the level of religious commitment \r\n    they seek.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In fact, examining this issue and the possibility of getting \r\n    what you want is to be done before marriage. After marriage, however, there \r\n    are two possible scenarios:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is a certain level of religious commitment but it is \r\n    less than expected or less than required. It is possible to accept this \r\n    situation, even if it is less than we hoped for, if the level of commitment \r\n    is limited to doing obligatory duties and staying away from haraam things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the woman adheres to that minimum obligatory level of \r\n    performing duties and avoiding haraam things, then she will be fine, in sha \r\n    Allah, so long as that includes obedience to her husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ahmad narrated (1573), in a report that was classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani, that &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;If a woman offers her five (daily) prayers, fasts her month, \r\n    guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: &lsquo;Enter \r\n    Paradise from whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After that, the man and his wife can work together to do more \r\n    good deeds and naafil acts of worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the serious problem is if the shortcoming in doing acts \r\n    of obedience reaches the level of omitting some obligatory duties or falling \r\n    into haraam actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ahmad (6664) narrated, in a report that was classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani, that &lsquo;Abd-Allah ibn &lsquo;Amr (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Every action starts with enthusiasm, then the enthusiasm wanes; \r\n    anyone whose enthusiasm wanes but (remains within the limits of) my Sunnah \r\n    will prosper, but anyone whose enthusiasm wanes and drifts away to something \r\n    else, will be doomed.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What this means is that there may be times when a person is \r\n    very energetic and enthusiastic about worship and acts of obedience, then \r\n    these energetic times are followed by a decrease in enthusiasm, laziness and \r\n    a drop from the level previously reached. This is something natural and \r\n    there is the hope that the individual will still prosper, but that is only \r\n    if, during the times of decreased enthusiasm and weakness, he does not \r\n    neglect the obligatory duties, because if he abandons them or takes them \r\n    lightly, he will be doomed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Doom is not caused by merely falling into sin, for we are all \r\n    sinners; rather a person is doomed when sins appear in his general behaviour \r\n    and that becomes his situation most of the time and he does not care or feel \r\n    regret or repent; rather he persists in that sin and feels at ease with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is clear from the way you described your wife that her \r\n    decrease in enthusiasm and backtracking is of the type that is dangerous, \r\n    and indeed is of the type that makes one doubt that she really was as \r\n    religiously committed as she appeared to be. Even if she has grown lazy \r\n    about some acts of worship, what does your beard have to do with her that \r\n    she should feel annoyed by it?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you have to do now is not to show any compromise towards \r\n    her situation. Being too lazy to get up for Fajr prayer is a major sin and \r\n    serious offence. In fact it is kufr that puts one beyond the pale of Islam \r\n    according to many of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him). That was also stated in a fatwa by Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez \r\n    ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him). So it is not permissible for you to \r\n    approve of that. If ghusl is what is preventing her from getting up, then \r\n    you should not let her go to sleep except in a state of purity, so that she \r\n    will have no excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We share your anxiety about your wife and we advise you to \r\n    delay having children with her and to try again with her. If you see that \r\n    she is praying regularly on time and is serious about it, including &ndash; first \r\n    and foremost &ndash; Fajr prayer, and she is obeying you and fulfilling the rights \r\n    that you have over her, then be patient with her for a while and see how \r\n    things go. Try to discipline her and teach her, and be patient in putting up \r\n    with her crookedness and weakness, in the hope that Allah may guide her and \r\n    set her straight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you find that she is persisting in neglecting the \r\n    prayer or trying to interfere with your religious commitment and objecting \r\n    to your beard, then there is nothing good for you in her and we advise you \r\n    to leave her before having children from her, which would only make the \r\n    problem more complicated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]141289[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]98624[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allah to guide you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5193","question_id":"5193","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth does not appear in any of the books of Sunnah, \r\n    or any books of saheeh (sound) hadeeth or even books of da&lsquo;eef (weak) \r\n    hadeeths.

Whoever can pray standing must do that, otherwise he should pray \r\n    sitting or on his side, or by making gestures, according to what he is able \r\n    to do, and Allaah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. That is because \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Pray \r\n    standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your \r\n    side.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1117).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who prays sitting should lean forward for bowing and \r\n    prostrating, making the prostration deeper than the bowing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he is unable to move his head, then should he gesture with \r\n    his eyes, or is prayer waived for him, or are the movements waived only and \r\n    not the words? The correct view is the third option.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    The most correct of these three views is that only the movements are waived, \r\n    because that is what he is unable to do. As for the words, they are not \r\n    waived in his case, because he is able to say them, and Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you \r\n    can&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Taghaabun 64:16]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So we say: Say takbeer, recite Qur&rsquo;aan, form the intention to \r\n    bow, say takbeer and the tasbeeh of bowing, then form the intention to stand \r\n    up, and say, <i>Sami&rsquo;a Allaahu liman hamidah Rabbana wa laka al-hamd<\/i> \r\n    (Allaah hears those who praise Him, our Lord to You be praise), and so on. \r\n    Then form the intention to prostrate and say takbeer and the tasbeeh of \r\n    prostration, because this is what is dictated by the shar&rsquo;i principle, <i>\r\n    &ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can&rdquo; [al-Taghaabun \r\n    64:16]<\/i>. If a person is unable to say the words or do the movements, such \r\n    as if a man is paralyzed and cannot speak, what should he do? The answer is \r\n    that both the words and the movements are waived in his case, but the \r\n    intention remains, so he should form the intention that he is praying, and \r\n    form the intention to recite, and form the intention to bow, prostrate, \r\n    stand and sit. This is the correct view, because the prayer is words and \r\n    movements accompanied by the intention, so if the words and movements are \r\n    waived because of one&rsquo;s inability to do them, there remains the intention. \r\n    And if we were to say to this sick person: You do not have to pray, that \r\n    might cause him to forget Allaah, because if a day and a night pass without \r\n    his praying, he may forget Allaah. So if we make him feel that he has to \r\n    pray even if it is only by intention, that is better than saying that he \r\n    does not have to pray.

This is the old view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and \r\n    of the Hanbalis and Maalikis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (3\/532): Our \r\n    companions said: Naafil prayers are of two types, one that is not connected \r\n    to a specific time and is only done for a reason such as eclipses, praying \r\n    for rain and greeting the mosque. If it is missed, it cannot be made up. The \r\n    second type is connected to a specific time, such as Eid prayer, Duha and \r\n    regular Sunnah prayers that are offered with obligatory prayers, such as the \r\n    Sunnah of Zuhr etc. There are three views concerning these, the correct view \r\n    is that it is mustahabb to make them up. Al-Qaadi Abu&rsquo;l-Tayyib and others \r\n    said that this is the view that is stated in the new view (of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second \r\n    view is that they should not be made up. This was stated in the old view (of \r\n    al-Shafaa&rsquo;i), and it is the view of Abu Haneefah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The third \r\n    view is that independent prayers such as Eid and Duha should be made up, \r\n    whereas prayers that are not independent such as the regular Sunnah prayers \r\n    that are offered with obligatory prayers should not be made up. If they are \r\n    made up then the correct view is that they should always be made up. Some of \r\n    our companions narrated a weak view which is that missed prayers of the day \r\n    may be made up so long as the sun has not set and missed prayers of the \r\n    night may be made up so long as the sun has not risen. Based on this, the \r\n    Sunnah of Fajr may be made up so long as it is still day&hellip; This is all weak \r\n    (da&rsquo;eef) and the correct view is that it is mustahabb to make up all prayers \r\n    at all times. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him):&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer \r\n    or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers it.&rdquo; And Abu Qataadah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) missed Fajr prayer whilst travelling, until \r\n    the sun had risen. So he did wudoo&rsquo; then he prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs, then the \r\n    iqaamah was given and he prayed Fajr prayer. What is meant by two rak&rsquo;ahs \r\n    here is the regular Sunnah prayer that comes before Fajr. And Umm Salamah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs after &lsquo;Asr and she asked \r\n    him about that. He said: &ldquo;Some people from &lsquo;Abd al-Qays came to me with the \r\n    news that their people had become Muslim and they distracted me from the two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs that come after Zuhr, so I did these two rak&rsquo;ahs after &lsquo;Asr.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. And Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever did not pray two rak&rsquo;ahs of Fajr until the sun \r\n    rose, let him pray them (now).&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bayhaqi with a jayyid isnaad. \r\n    And it was narrated from Abu Sa&rsquo;eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) that \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    slept and missed Witr, or forgot it, let him pray it when he remembers.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood with a hasan isnaad. And it was narrated from \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that if the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) missed praying at night because of pain \r\n    or anything else, he would pray twelve rak&rsquo;ahs during the day. Narrated by \r\n    Muslim. There are many other ahaadeeth about this matter, apart from those \r\n    which we have mentioned, but this is sufficient. And Allaah is the Source of \r\n    strength.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Hanafis \r\n    stated that if the Sunnah prayers are missed, none of them should be made up \r\n    except the Sunnah of Fajr, which should be made up if it is missed along \r\n    with the obligatory prayer, and it may be made up until the sun reaches its \r\n    zenith. <i>Al-Fataawa al-Hindiyyah<\/i> (1\/112).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is also \r\n    the view of the Maalikis. In their view no naafil prayer should be made up \r\n    except the two rak&rsquo;ahs of Fajr, which may be made up until the sun reaches \r\n    the zenith, whether the obligatory Fajr prayer was offered alongside it or \r\n    not. <i>Balghat al-Saalik<\/i> (1\/408).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See also <i>\r\n    al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah<\/i> (34\/37).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured the view that Duha prayer \r\n    should not be made up if the time for it has ended. He was asked: If the \r\n    Sunnah prayer of Duha is missed, should it be made up or not? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: \r\n    If the time for Duha prayer is missed, then the prayer has been missed, \r\n    because it is limited to that time. But with regard to the regular Sunnah \r\n    prayers, because they are connected to the obligatory prayers, they may be \r\n    made up alongside them. The same also applies to Witr, because it is proven \r\n    in the Sunnah that if the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) slept or was ill at night he would pray twelve rak&rsquo;ahs during the \r\n    day.

He said: \r\n    &ldquo;Witr, between &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer and the break of dawn.&rdquo; And there are many \r\n    ahaadeeth on this topic, which indicates that Witr ends with the break of \r\n    dawn.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a \r\n    worshipper does not know when dawn is, he may rely on a muezzin who is known \r\n    to pay attention to the right time. If the muezzin who pays attention to the \r\n    right time gives the adhaan, then he has missed witr. As for the one who \r\n    gives the adhaan before dawn breaks, he has not missed witr when he gives \r\n    the adhaan and this does not mean that it has become haraam for one who is \r\n    fasting to eat and drink, and the time for Fajr prayer has not begun with \r\n    this adhaan. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Bilaal gives the adhaan at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm \r\n    Maktoom gives the adhaan.&rdquo; Saheeh &ndash; agreed upon. Ibn Umm Maktoom was a blind \r\n    man who did not give the adhaan until he was told that dawn had come. From \r\n    what we have mentioned it is clear that the time for witr ends with the \r\n    first adhaan if the muezzin pays attention to the correct time of dawn, but \r\n    if the muezzin gives the adhaan when the Muslim is in the final rak'ah of \r\n    witr, he should complete it because he cannot be certain that dawn has come \r\n    just from hearing the adhaan, and there is nothing wrong with that in sha \r\n    Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person \r\n    misses Fajr, it is prescribed for him to pray what he usually prays during \r\n    the day, but he should make it even-numbered by adding one rak&rsquo;ah. If he \r\n    usually prays three, he should make it four, and if he usually prays five, \r\n    he should make it six, and so on, saying the tasleem after each two rak&rsquo;ahs. \r\n    It is narrated in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah&nbsp; (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her) said: If the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) missed witr at night because he was sick or sleeping, he would \r\n    pray twelve rak&rsquo;ahs during the day. And he usually prayed eleven rak&rsquo;ahs, \r\n    but if sickness or sleep kept him from doing that, he would pray twelve \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs as &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said, saying the \r\n    tasleem after each two rak&rsquo;ahs, as &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    her) said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) used to pray ten rak&rsquo;ahs at night, saying the tasleem after each \r\n    two rak&rsquo;ahs, and praying witr with one.&rdquo; Saheeh &ndash; agreed upon. And the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The prayers \r\n    of the night and day are two by two.&rdquo; Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the authors \r\n    of <i>al-Sunan<\/i> with a saheeh isnaad from the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him). It is narrated in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> with the \r\n    wording, &ldquo;The night prayers are two by two,&rdquo; as we stated at the beginning. \r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

Al-Mardaawi \r\n    stated in <i>al-Insaaf<\/i> (4\/413) that this view was favoured by a number \r\n    of the companions of Imam Ahmad, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and \r\n    his grandfather al-Majd ibn Taymiyah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/143:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he intends to pray \r\n    Fajr behind one who is praying Zuhr and the congregational prayer is \r\n    completed, if he wishes he may wait during the Tashahhud until the imam \r\n    finishes, and say the tasleem with him, which is better, or if he wishes he \r\n    may decide to leave him and say the tasleem. This leaving does not \r\n    invalidate his prayer, and there is no scholarly dispute on this point, \r\n    because he is excused from following the imam. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some worshippers were delayed in praying Maghrib, and they \r\n    found that the imam had started to pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;. Should they pray Maghrib in \r\n    a congregation on their own, or join the imam? And how should they pray?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that if a person comes (to the mosque) \r\n    and the imam is praying &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, whether he is with a group or not, he should \r\n    join the imam, with the intention of praying Maghrib. It does not matter if \r\n    the imam&rsquo;s intention is different from that of one who is praying behind \r\n    him, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that \r\n    which he intended.&rdquo; If they join him in the second rak&rsquo;ah, they can say the \r\n    tasleem with him, because they will have prayed three rak&rsquo;ahs, and it does \r\n    not matter if they sit for the Tashahhud during their first rak&rsquo;ah. If they \r\n    join him in the first rak&rsquo;ah, then when he stands up for the fourth rak&rsquo;ah, \r\n    they can sit and recite the Tashahhud and say the tasleem, then join him in \r\n    what remains of &lsquo;Isha prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second opinion concerning this matter is that they should \r\n    join him with the intention of praying &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, then pray Maghrib after that, \r\n    and the obligation to offer the prayers in order is waived because of the \r\n    duty to join the congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third view is that they should pray Maghrib on their own, \r\n    then join him in whatever is left of &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer. The last two views \r\n    involve something about which there is some reservation. The first view \r\n    involves neglecting the order of prayers by putting &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; before Maghrib. \r\n    The second view involves having two congregations in one mosque at the same \r\n    time, which is dividing the ummah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the first view which we mentioned is the correct one. \r\n    Someone may say that there is something wrong, which is saying the tasleem \r\n    before the imam. In fact there is nothing wrong with this. It is narrated in \r\n    some places in the Sunnah that a member of the congregation may do something \r\n    separately from the imam, such as in the fear prayer, where the imam leads \r\n    them in one rak&rsquo;ah, then they complete the prayer by themselves and leave.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example is the story of the man who joined Mu&rsquo;aadh \r\n    ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) in prayer, but when he started to \r\n    recite Soorat al-Baqarah or another similar soorah, he left him and did not \r\n    complete the prayer with him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the scholars said \r\n    that if a man is praying in congregation then he feels that is about to pass \r\n    wind or that he needs to break his wudoo&rsquo; by urinating or defecating, then \r\n    there is no sin on him if he decides to pray alone and completes his prayer \r\n    and leaves. This indicates that praying alone in the case of need is not \r\n    regarded as wrong.

When the imam \r\n    stands up for the fourth rak&rsquo;ah, you should sit in the third rak&rsquo;ah and \r\n    recite the final tashahhud &ndash; i.e., <i>al-tahhiyaatu<\/i> and the blessings \r\n    upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &ndash; and make \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; after that, then wait for the imam to say the tasleem and say the \r\n    tasleem with him. It does not matter if the imam and the member of the \r\n    congregation have different intentions, according to the sound scholarly \r\n    opinion. If you pray Maghrib on your own and then join the congregation in \r\n    what is left of &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer, there is nothing wrong with that.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said, &ldquo;Knowledge comes by learning.&rdquo; (Classed as hasan by Ibn Hajar in <i>\r\n    Fath al-Baari<\/i>).

We advise you to try hard to learn Arabic, at least Soorat \r\n    al-Faatihah and the pillars and essential parts of prayer. That should be \r\n    easy, either by learning it from a Muslim who knows it by heart and can read \r\n    it well, or by going to a website on the Internet that has audio recordings \r\n    of the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan and listening to it and memorizing it from that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to missing prayers, one of the following two \r\n    scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; When you miss a prayer unintentionally, for a legitimate \r\n    shar&rsquo;i excuse, such as forgetting or sleeping, although you are basically \r\n    very keen to perform the prayer on time. In this case you are excused but \r\n    you have to make it up as soon as you remember it. The evidence for that is \r\n    the hadeeth narrated in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> (681) which tells how the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions \r\n    slept and missed Fajr prayer, and the Sahaabah began to ask one another, \r\n    &ldquo;What is the expiation (kafaarah) for what we have done by neglecting the \r\n    prayer?&rdquo; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said. &ldquo;Sleeping does not mean that you are neglecting the prayer. \r\n    Rather neglecting the prayer means not praying one prayer until the time for \r\n    the next prayer comes. Whoever does that let him pray when he remembers \r\n    it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This does not mean that a person should sleep deliberately \r\n    when a prayer is due, until he misses it, then use sleep as an excuse, or \r\n    neglect a means that would help him to do the prayer, and then take that as \r\n    an excuse. Rather he must make use of all the means he can, as the Messenger \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did in this case, when he \r\n    appointed one person to stay awake and wake them up to pray, but that person \r\n    was overcome by drowsiness, so he did not wake them up. This is the case in \r\n    which a person may be excused.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; When you miss a prayer deliberately. This is a major sin, \r\n    and it is so serious that some of the scholars stated that the one who does \r\n    this is a kaafir. (as it says in Majm<i>oo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Samaahat \r\n    al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, 10\/374). The one who does this has to repent \r\n    sincerely, according to scholarly consensus. With regard to making up the \r\n    prayer, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether \r\n    or not it would be accepted from him if he makes it up afterwards. Most of \r\n    the scholars said that he should make it up and that his prayer is valid, \r\n    although he is a sinner (i.e., if he does not repent &ndash; and Allaah knows \r\n    best), as Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthyameen quoted from them in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    2\/89. The view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) is that it is not valid, and that it is not prescribed for him \r\n    to make it up. He said in <i>al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i> (34): &ldquo;It is not prescribed \r\n    for the one who misses a prayer deliberately to make it up, and the prayer, \r\n    if he makes it up, is not valid; rather he should do a lot of voluntary \r\n    (naafil) prayers. This is the view of a group among the Salaf.&rdquo; One of the \r\n    contemporary scholars who regarded this view as more correct is Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him); he quoted as evidence for that \r\n    the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \r\n    &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours \r\n    (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.&rdquo; (Agreed upon).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you must beware of this and strive to perform all the \r\n    prayers on time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, As&#8209;Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the \r\n    believers at fixed hours&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:103]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to \r\n    repentance, you will find a detailed answer under question no. \r\n    [fatin]14289[\\fatin] on this \r\n    website.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to meat that has been slaughtered by a \r\n    non-Muslim, you will find an answer under question no. \r\n    [fatin]10339[\\fatin].<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;With regard to your question about seafood, it is all halaal \r\n    in principle, because Allaah say (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) \r\n    water game and its use for food &mdash; for the benefit of yourselves&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa'idah 5:96]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;We ask Allaah to help you to learn Arabic and to understand \r\n    Islam, and to do more righteous deeds, for He is Able to do that.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5211","question_id":"5211","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>This question will be answered by addressing three points:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>1 &ndash; The ruling on praying missed prayers in order:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imaam Abu Haneefah, Imaam Maalik and Imaam Ahmad are of the \r\n    view that it is obligatory to pray missed prayers in order when making them \r\n    up. The evidence for that is the fact that when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) missed some prayers on the day of \r\n    al-Khandaq, he made them up in order.

This is the view of Imaam Abu Haneefah and Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on them).

So he \r\n    should complete the current prayer, which then becomes a naafil \r\n    (supererogatory) prayer, then he should pray the prayer his missed, and then \r\n    repeat the current prayer, in order to keep them in the proper order. This \r\n    is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him). See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, \r\n    2\/336-340). This is also the view of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with them both). Imaam Maalik narrated in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> (408) \r\n    that Naafi&rsquo; ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar used to say, &ldquo;Whoever forgets a prayer \r\n    then remembers it only when he is with the imaam, then when the imaam says \r\n    the salaam, let him pray the prayer that he had forgotten, then let him pray \r\n    the other after that.&rdquo; Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah &ndash; may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said: &ldquo;When he remembers the prayer that he missed during the \r\n    (current) prayer, it is as if he remembered before he started it. But if he \r\n    does not remember until the current prayer is finished, then the current \r\n    prayer is valid according to the majority of scholars, such as Abu Haneefah, \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad&hellip;&rdquo; (<i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 1\/112)<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    His completing the prayer that he is currently praying is \r\n    mustahabb (recommended), not waajib (obligatory). If he stops that prayer, \r\n    then prays the prayer he missed, then prays the current prayer, that is \r\n    permissible. Muhanna said: &ldquo;I said to Ahmad, &lsquo;I was praying &lsquo;Isha, then I \r\n    remembered that I had not prayed Maghrib.

This is the view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, as stated in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 3\/70. This was also the view \r\n    favoured by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). (<i>Majmoo&rsquo; \r\n    Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, 12\/221). But the first opinion is more on the \r\n    safe side.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>3 &ndash; The questioner says that he did not pray Fajr because \r\n    he was sick<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What he did was not correct, because sickness is not an \r\n    excuse to delay the prayer until the time for prayer is over. Rather what \r\n    the Muslim must do is to offer the prayer on time. If he is sick, he should \r\n    pray as best he can, for Allaah does not burden a soul beyond what it is \r\n    able to bear. If he is unable to stand, then he may pray sitting down. If he \r\n    is unable to sit, then he may pray lying on his side. If he is unable to do \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;, then he should do tayammum. If there is some impurity on his body \r\n    and he is unable to remove it, then he should pray as he is, and so on. It \r\n    is not permissible for him to delay the prayer until the time for it is over \r\n    because he is unable to purify himself or remove the impurity. Rather he \r\n    should pray as best he can and do as much of the obligatory actions of \r\n    prayer as he is able, and he is relieved of the obligation to do the things \r\n    that he is unable to do.

This is how the believer should be, he should feel regret if he misses \r\n    out on some righteous deed. But this regret should be a motive for him to \r\n    correct his actions and avoid falling short in them.

It will not take you \r\n    more than ten minutes to do this thing, so you can agree with the boss that \r\n    you will make up this time before or after your shift. You may not be able \r\n    to imagine that you can ask permission for ten minutes from work, but if you \r\n    wanted to go to the bathroom they would never stop you from doing that, even \r\n    though that may take the same amount of time or more.

When the sun rises in \r\n    the east, the shadow of this stick will fall towards the west. The higher \r\n    the sun rises, the shorter the shadow will become. So long as it keeps \r\n    growing shorter, the sun has not yet reached its zenith. The shadow will \r\n    keep on growing shorter until it reaches a certain point, then it will start \r\n    to increase, falling towards the east. When it increases by even a small \r\n    amount, then the sun has passed its zenith.

Let us assume that \r\n    its length is one meter. We will notice that before the sun reached its \r\n    zenith, the shadow decreased gradually until it reached a certain point \r\n    (make a mark at this point), then it started to increase, at which point the \r\n    time for Zuhr began. The shadow will continue to increase, falling towards \r\n    the east until the length of the shadow is equal to the length of the object \r\n    itself, i.e., it will be one meter long, starting from the point marked at \r\n    the zenith). As for the shadow before the mark, that is not counted, and it \r\n    is called fay&rsquo; al-zawaal (the shadow of the zenith). At this point the time \r\n    for Zuhr ends and the time for &lsquo;Asr begins straight away.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>2 &ndash; The time of &lsquo;Asr<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The time for &lsquo;Asr lasts until the sun turns yellow.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We know that the time for &lsquo;Asr begins when the time for Zuhr \r\n    ends, i.e., when the length of an object&rsquo;s shadow becomes equal to the \r\n    length of the object itself.

What is meant \r\n    by delaying it from its proper time is delaying it from the preferred or \r\n    best time, not delaying it from its time altogether, because what was \r\n    narrated from the earlier and later rulers is that they delayed it from its \r\n    preferred time; none of them delayed it from its time altogether. So we must \r\n    interpret these reports according to what actually happened.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (<i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, 5\/47 ff)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thus it will be clear to you that there is a \r\n    difference between establishing prayer and delaying it. The ahaadeeth are \r\n    not referring to delaying the prayer from its time altogether until the time \r\n    for the prayer is over and then praying, rather what is meant is delaying it \r\n    from the preferred time, such as delaying &#8216;Asr until the sun has turned \r\n    yellow, or delaying Maghrib until the red afterglow has almost disappeared, \r\n    and so on. What is meant by not establishing prayer is not doing it at all. \r\n    Thus we may reconcile between the ahaadeeth.

Hence we \r\n    cannot explain what these times are by the clock for all lands and in all \r\n    seasons. But we will explain the general principles which will make it easy \r\n    for every Muslim to work out when these times are. Hence we say that the \r\n    times when prayer is forbidden are three:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From when dawn breaks until approximately a quarter of an \r\n    hour after the sun has risen.

So the \r\n    beginning of the time when prayer is forbidden is when one has prayed &lsquo;Asr, \r\n    not the beginning of the time for &lsquo;Asr prayer, because the Muslim may offer \r\n    &lsquo;Asr prayer some time after the time for it begins. In that case the Muslim \r\n    may offer voluntary prayers so long as he has not yet prayed &lsquo;Asr, even if \r\n    the time for &lsquo;Asr has begun. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (1\/429): We do not know of any difference of \r\n    opinion concerning that among those who say that prayer is not allowed after \r\n    &lsquo;Asr.

Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended \r\n    until the shadow of a spear falls directly north (i.e., noon). Then refrain \r\n    from praying, for at that time Hell is stoked up. Then when the shadow moves \r\n    forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended, until you have \r\n    prayed &lsquo;Asr.

Some scholars called for adopting Makkah al-Mukarramah as the \r\n    standard in this case. One of those who supported this view is the author of \r\n    the essay referred to above.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the time for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; that \r\n    is prescribed in sharee&lsquo;ah, namely the disappearance of the twilight, should \r\n    be adhered to so long as the time is sufficient to offer the prayer.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This last opinion is the one that we think is most likely to \r\n    be correct and is the opinion that is indicated by the hadeeth texts. It is \r\n    mentioned in fatwas issued by the Council of Senior Scholars, the Standing \r\n    Committee for Issuing Fatwas, Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen, Shaykh Ibn Baaz, and \r\n    other scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These specified times only apply in places where night and \r\n    day occur within twenty-four hours, whether night and day are equal in \r\n    length or one of them is longer than the other by a short or long period.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for places in which night and day do not occur within \r\n    twenty-four hours, that applies either throughout the year or only for a few \r\n    days:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is only for a few days, such as if it is a place in \r\n    which night and day occur within twenty-four hours throughout the seasons of \r\n    the year, but during some periods there may be twenty-four hours or more of \r\n    either night or day, in that case if there is a phenomenon on the horizon by \r\n    means of which you can work out the time, such as if the light starts to \r\n    increase or when it disappears completely, then deciding the time may be \r\n    connected to this phenomenon. Or if there is no such phenomenon, you can \r\n    work out the times of prayer as they were on the last day before night or \r\n    day began to last for twenty-four hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if it is a place where night and day within twenty-four \r\n    hours does not occur all year or in any season, then the times for prayer \r\n    should be worked out, because of the hadeeth narrated by Muslim from \r\n    an-Nawwaas ibn Sam&lsquo;aan (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjaal \r\n    who will appear at the end of time. They asked him how long he would stay on \r\n    earth and he said: &ldquo;Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, \r\n    one day like a week, and the rest of his days will be like your days.&rdquo; They \r\n    said: O Messenger of Allah, on that day which will be like a year, will the \r\n    prayers of one day be sufficient for us? He said: &ldquo;No, work it out&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if it is established that in a place in which night and \r\n    day do not occur (within twenty-four hours) the times for prayer are to be \r\n    worked out, then how do we work it out?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; Some scholars think that it should be worked out according \r\n    to the average time. So the night is to be estimated as being twelve hours, \r\n    and the same for the day, because when it is not possible to work out the \r\n    time of prayer based on the place itself, it should be worked out on the \r\n    basis of a place where night and day are equal. This is like the case of the \r\n    woman who is suffering istihaadah (prolonged non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) \r\n    and does not have a period as such and cannot distinguish between menstrual \r\n    and non-menstrual bleeding.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Others say that it should be worked out in accordance with \r\n    the nearest land in which night and day occur throughout the year; because \r\n    when it is not possible to work it out with regard to the land itself, then \r\n    it should be worked out in accordance with the land that most closely \r\n    resembles it, which is the nearest land to it in which night and day occur \r\n    within twenty-four hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view is more correct, because it is based on a stronger \r\n    argument and is more realistic.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    12\/197, 198&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of the Council of Senior Scholars in the \r\n    Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and is supported by the Standing Committee for \r\n    Issuing Fatwas.

But they stated that this \r\n    should not be made a habit for everyone; rather it is only for those who \r\n    have legitimate reasons. It says in that statement:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the signs of the time for the prayer appear, but the \r\n    disappearance of the twilight with which the time for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; begins, is very \r\n    late, the Council believes that it is obligatory to offer &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer at \r\n    the proper time as defined by sharee&lsquo;ah. But those for whom it is too \r\n    difficult to wait and offer the prayer on time &ndash; such as students, people \r\n    with jobs and workers during the work week &ndash; can put the prayers together, \r\n    in accordance with the texts which speak of protecting this ummah from \r\n    hardship. For example, in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> and elsewhere it is narrated \r\n    that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of \r\n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put together Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, \r\n    and Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, in Madinah, when there was no fear or rain. Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas was asked about that and he said: He wanted not to put his ummah \r\n    through hardship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But putting prayers together should not be something that is \r\n    done by all the people in that country throughout that period, because that \r\n    is changing the concession and making it become the norm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the guideline on what constitutes hardship, reference \r\n    should be made to custom and this is something that differs from one person \r\n    to another, from one place and situation to another.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from the nineteenth session, held in the \r\n    headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, 22-27 \r\n    Shawwaal 1428 AH\/ 3-8 November 2007 CE, second statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to defining the time between Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; \r\n    as being one hour and thirty-two minutes, we could not find anything \r\n    concerning that from Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen or anyone else.

But the \r\n    scholars stated that if (a muezzin) is given something from the bayt al-maal \r\n    to help him do that, there is no blame on him for that and there is nothing \r\n    wrong with it, because the bayt al-maal is for the interests of the Muslims, \r\n    and the same applies to the awqaaf that Muslims have established to support \r\n    muezzins and imams. There is nothing wrong with them taking from them that \r\n    which will help them to do this righteous deed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if you take from the bayt al-maal or the Ministry of \r\n    Awqaaf that which will help you, there is nothing wrong with that, and we \r\n    hope that you will have the reward in full because you have taken something \r\n    to help you to do this duty and this righteous deed, and perhaps if you did \r\n    not take it you would give up this work in order to earn a living in other \r\n    ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up, if the muezzin is given something to help him give \r\n    the adhaan because he is in need of that, there is nothing wrong with that, \r\n    because giving the adhaan is keeping him busy and occupying his time.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if Allah has given him plenty and he wants to work \r\n    without receiving anything from the bayt al-maal, this is preferable and is \r\n    better, because in that case his act of worship is more complete and has \r\n    nothing to detract from it; rather his deed is complete and proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he takes something from the bayt al-maal, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with that, because the bayt al-maal is for all Muslims, \r\n    especially with regard to things that are in the public interest such as the \r\n    adhaan, leading prayers and so on. The same applies to awqaaf that have been \r\n    set up to provide for muezzins and imams. All of that comes under the \r\n    heading of cooperation in righteousness and piety, and making things easy. \r\n    Not everyone has spare time to lead the prayers or give the call to prayer, \r\n    so if his needs are met, it is more likely that he will be committed and \r\n    will do this important and necessary task.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps the hadeeth refers to one who insisted on payment, \r\n    i.e., he said, &ldquo;I will not give the call to prayer unless I paid for that,&rdquo; \r\n    i.e., as the stipulation between him and the people of the mosque, or \r\n    between him and some other people. This is closer to the apparent meaning of \r\n    the text. With regard to the one who is given from the bayt al-maal, such as \r\n    teachers, imams and mujaahideen, that does not come under this heading, in \r\n    sha Allah. But there is no doubt that the one who does not want to take \r\n    anything at all &ndash; and he wants to volunteer to do this because Allah has \r\n    given him wealth and made him well off, this is more complete in terms of \r\n    sincerity.

In the hadeeth of &lsquo;As&rsquo;ishah, the later adhaan clearly called the \r\n    first adhaan in relation to the iqaamah, because the iqaamah is a second \r\n    adhaan, and the later adhaan may be called the second adhaan, in relation to \r\n    the first adhaan, the purpose of which is to alert people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars are of the view that these words should \r\n    be said in the first adhaan which serves to alert people before dawn breaks. \r\n    This issue is broad in scope, in sha Allah, but these words should not be \r\n    said in both calls. It is better to say them in the second call which is the \r\n    first in relation to the iqaamah and is the adhaan that is given after dawn \r\n    breaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by the words &ldquo;prayer is better than sleep&rdquo; is \r\n    that the obligatory prayer that Allah has enjoined is better than sleep, and \r\n    what people should do is get up for it. With regard to the naafil prayers at \r\n    the end of the night or during the night, they are not obligatory, and sleep \r\n    may be better than prayer if being sleepy is going to affect his prayer. [In \r\n    that case] he should sleep and have his share of rest so that he will be \r\n    able to pray properly.

To proceed:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, it is as the questioner says. At the time of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there was one adhaan, with the \r\n    iqaamah. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came \r\n    out to deliver the khutbah and lead the prayer, the mu&rsquo;adhdhin gave the \r\n    adhaan, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    delivered the two khutbahs, then the iqaamah would be given. This is what is \r\n    known and this is what is narrated in the books of Sunnah, as the questioner \r\n    says, and it is something well-known to people of knowledge and faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But then the people&rsquo;s numbers in Madinah increased at the \r\n    time of the Rightly Guided Caliph &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn &lsquo;Affaan (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him), so he decided to add the third adhaan. It is called the first \r\n    adhaan, and is given to alert the people to the fact that this day is \r\n    Friday, so that they may prepare themselves and hasten to the prayer before \r\n    the regular adhaan that is given after the sun has passed the meridian. The \r\n    Sahaabah followed him in that at his time, such as &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him), &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf, one of the ten (who were \r\n    promised Paradise), az-Zubayr ibn al-&lsquo;Awwaam, who was also one of the ten, \r\n    Talhah ibn &lsquo;Ubaydullah, and other senior Sahaabah. And this is how the \r\n    Muslims started to do it in most regions, following the action of the \r\n    Rightly Guided Caliph, &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn &lsquo;Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him); \r\n    he was followed in that by the Rightly Guided Caliph &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him) and the rest of the Sahaabah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that this happened during the caliphate of \r\n    &lsquo;Uthmaan and subsequently, and it has remained the practice of most of the \r\n    Muslims throughout the regions and throughout the centuries until the \r\n    present day, following the precedent that was set by &lsquo;Uthmaan (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him), on the basis of his ijtihaad and sincerity towards the \r\n    Muslims. And there is nothing wrong with that, because the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I urge you to adhere to my \r\n    Sunnah and the way of the Rightly Guided Caliphs; hold fast to it.&rdquo; He \r\n    (&lsquo;Uthmaan) was one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and the interest served by \r\n    that is quite clear. Hence this was adopted by Ahl as-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah, \r\n    and they did not see anything wrong with it, because it was part of the \r\n    practice of the Rightly Guided Caliphs &lsquo;Uthmaan and &lsquo;Ali and those of the \r\n    Sahaabah who were present at that time (may Allah be pleased with them all). \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him)&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala ad-Darb, 2\/1038"},{"id":"5304","question_id":"5304","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For one who is praying on his own, the adhaan is Sunnah, but \r\n    it is prescribed for him to do it in the case of a prayer that is being made \r\n    up, and he should perform it in full.

The fact that giving the adhaan is Sunnah for one who is praying \r\n    alone is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (609) from &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allah ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Sa&lsquo;sa&lsquo;ah al-Ansaari from his father, \r\n    who told him that Abu Sa&lsquo;eed al-Khudri said to him: I see that you love \r\n    sheep and the wilderness.

But because the adhaan is \r\n    remembrance and veneration of Allah, and is a call to himself to prayer and \r\n    prosperity, (it is Sunnah) and the iqaamah, likewise, is also Sunnah. The \r\n    fact that it is mustahabb to give the adhaan is indicated by what is said in \r\n    the hadeeth of &lsquo;Uqbah ibn &lsquo;Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I \r\n    heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \r\n    &ldquo;Your Lord wonders at a shepherd at the top of a mountain who gives a call \r\n    to prayer, and Allah says: &lsquo;Look at this slave of Mine giving the adhaan and \r\n    iqaamah for prayer and fearing Me.

Rather the general \r\n    meaning of the evidence about praying before sitting down in the mosque \r\n    includes the Sacred Mosque too, and the view that its greeting is tawaaf is \r\n    contrary to the general meaning referred to, so it should not be accepted \r\n    unless it is proven.

The Hanafis are of the \r\n    view that she invalidates the prayer of three men: one to her right, another \r\n    to her left and a third behind her, subject to conditions that they \r\n    mentioned, which may be summed up by saying that if the woman is desirable, \r\n    has reached the age of seven years or is of marriageable age, with some \r\n    variations in the madhhab on this point, and she joins in a regular prayer \r\n    with a man, which includes bowing and prostrating, and they join together \r\n    simultaneously in the opening takbeer and the prayer, and the imam intended \r\n    to lead women in prayer, and other details which may be referred to in their \r\n    books.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See <i>\r\n    al-Mabsoot<\/i> (1\/183); <i>Badaa&rsquo;i&rsquo; al-Sanaa&rsquo;i&rsquo;<\/i> (1\/239); <i>Tabyeen \r\n    al-Haqaa&rsquo;iq<\/i> (1\/136-139).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, discussing the difference of opinion on \r\n    this topic and summing up the Hanafi view: If a man prays and there is a \r\n    woman beside him, that does not invalidate his prayer or hers, whether he is \r\n    leading the prayer or praying behind an imam. This is our view and it was \r\n    also the view of Maalik and the majority. Abu Haneefah said: If the woman is \r\n    not praying or she is offering a different prayer than him and is not \r\n    praying with him, his prayer and hers are both valid. If she is praying with \r\n    him &ndash; and in Abu Haneefah&rsquo;s view she cannot be praying with him unless the \r\n    imam intended to lead the women in prayer too &ndash; then if she joins the prayer \r\n    and stands beside a man, the prayer of the men who are standing on either \r\n    side of her is invalidated, but her prayer and the prayer of the man who is \r\n    beside the man who is beside her are not invalidated, because there is a \r\n    barrier between her and him. If she is in the row in front of him, the \r\n    prayer of those who are beside her and behind her are invalidated, but the \r\n    prayer of those who are beside the ones who are beside her is not \r\n    invalidated, because there is a barrier between them. If the women&rsquo;s row is \r\n    behind the imam and there is a row of men behind them, then the prayer of \r\n    the row behind them is invalidated, but by analogy the prayer of the rows \r\n    behind that row is not invalidated, because there is a barrier. But we say \r\n    that the prayer of the rows of men behind them is invalidated, even if there \r\n    are a hundred rows. If she stands beside the imam, then the prayer of the \r\n    imam is invalidated, because she is next to him, and his view is that if the \r\n    prayer of the imam is invalidated, the prayer of those who are praying \r\n    behind him is also invalidated, and her prayer is also invalidated, because \r\n    she is one of those who are praying behind him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This view is \r\n    based on weak evidence and this argument has no basis. Our view is that the \r\n    prayer is valid unless there is sound shar&rsquo;i evidence to prove that it is \r\n    invalid, and they do not have such proof. Our companions drew an analogy \r\n    from her standing in the funeral prayer, which is not invalidated in their \r\n    view. Allaah knows best which is correct, and to Him be all praise.

If he \r\n    is one who commits immoral actions or innovations openly, then it is \r\n    obligatory to denounce him and tell him not to do that, and the minimum \r\n    level of denouncing is shunning him, so that he will give up his immoral \r\n    actions or bid&rsquo;ah. Hence the majority of imams differentiated between the \r\n    daa&rsquo;iyah and others: if a daa&rsquo;iyah commits evil openly then he deserves to \r\n    be denounced for it, unlike the one who keeps quiet, who is like one who \r\n    commits sin secretly, so he should not be denounced openly, because if the \r\n    sin is done secretly it does not affect anyone but the one who does it; but \r\n    if he commits sin openly and is not denounced, then this harms everyone.

As Allaah \r\n    has enjoined prayer in congregation in the battlefield, so it is more \r\n    appropriate that it is obligatory at times of stability and peace. This has \r\n    been discussed in the answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]120[\\fatin] and \r\n    [fatin]8918[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>It is \r\n    obligatory to pray in congregation in the mosque, not in workplaces or \r\n    schools.<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This applies \r\n    if the Muslim is accountable, male, able to do it and can hear the adhaan \r\n    without the aid of a loudspeaker.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is \r\n    indicated by the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) thought of burning down the houses of those who prayed at home, \r\n    even though they may have prayed in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was \r\n    narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;I was thinking of ordering that the iqaamah for prayer be given, then I \r\n    would tell a man to lead the people in prayer, and I would set out with men \r\n    carrying bundles of firewood, and go to people who do not attend the prayer \r\n    and burn their houses down around them.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (657) and \r\n    Muslim (651).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This has been \r\n    discussed in the answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]72398[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence there is \r\n    no comparison between prayer in congregation at home and prayer in \r\n    congregation in the mosque. The reward and virtue come from praying in \r\n    congregation in the mosque. The one who does not pray in congregation in the \r\n    mosque and chooses to pray in congregation at home or in the workplace does \r\n    not attain the reward of praying in congregation in the mosque, if he is \r\n    free from sin in the first place.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The one who \r\n    has an excuse for not attending prayer in congregation in the mosque will \r\n    have the same reward as those who pray in congregation, even if he prays at \r\n    home.<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A Muslim may \r\n    be excused for not praying in congregation in the mosque, such as if he is \r\n    far away and the sound of the adhaan in its natural form does not reach him, \r\n    or he is sick, or afraid. If that is the case, then he should pray in \r\n    congregation with the members of his family who are not obliged to pray in \r\n    congregation, or those who have a similar excuse. Here it is valid to \r\n    differentiate between the congregation in the mosque and the congregation of \r\n    these people in terms of numbers. The congregation that is greater in number \r\n    is more beloved to Allaah &ndash; and we shall quote the relevant hadeeth below &ndash; \r\n    but there is no room for comparison of other rewards, such as the number of \r\n    steps that the worshipper takes to the mosque, or coming early to pray, and \r\n    Allaah preparing a welcome in Paradise every time he comes and goes, and so \r\n    on. These rewards are denied to the one who prays in his house, unless he is \r\n    one who regularly prays in the mosque but is kept from doing so by sickness \r\n    or some other reason, in which case a reward will be decreed for him like \r\n    that which he used to do, as is stated in a saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For the one \r\n    who is excused, the reward will be decreed if it was his habit to pray in \r\n    congregation, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;If a person falls sick or travels, there will be decreed \r\n    for him a reward like that for what he used to do when he was healthy or not \r\n    travelling.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh \r\n    al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (4\/323).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a man does \r\n    not have anyone to pray with, he may pray alone, but the more people who \r\n    pray, the dearer that is to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>If a person \r\n    deliberately misses the first jamaa&rsquo;ah (prayer in congregation), he is \r\n    sinning, but his praying in congregation is better than his praying alone, \r\n    although he will not have the reward of the first jamaa&rsquo;ah<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who \r\n    delay it without any excuse and aim to pray with the second or third \r\n    jamaa&rsquo;ah &ndash; as happens in some marketplace mosques &ndash; are sinning by \r\n    deliberately missing the first jamaa&rsquo;ah, and they are deprived of the reward \r\n    even if they pray in congregation with a group that is larger than the first \r\n    jamaa&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the \r\n    view of those who say that if they pray in the mosque, even if that is after \r\n    the first jamaa&rsquo;ah, they will have the twenty-seven-fold reward, this is not \r\n    correct. The twenty-seven-fold reward applies only to the first jamaa&rsquo;ah. As \r\n    for the second jamaa&rsquo;ah, undoubtedly praying in congregation is better than \r\n    praying individually, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said concerning a man who entered the mosque and had \r\n    missed the prayer: &ldquo;Who will give charity to this man and pray with him?&rdquo; \r\n    and one of the people got up and prayed with him. And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s praying with two other men \r\n    is better than his praying with one other man, and the more there are, the \r\n    more beloved that is to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.&rdquo; But as for \r\n    the second jamaa&rsquo;ah attaining the same reward as the first, this is not \r\n    correct. Otherwise people would go to the mosque whenever they wanted, and \r\n    they would pray in congregation and say, We have gotten the \r\n    twenty-seven-fold reward. But I do not know of anyone who says that, i.e., \r\n    that the second prayer is like the first in terms of attaining the \r\n    twenty-seven-fold reward.

But that should be limited to whatever will serve the purpose, \r\n    without being extravagant.

It says in <i>al-Insaaf<\/i>: al-Haarithi said: \r\n    This is our view. He said: It is more likely that they are permissible for \r\n    other poor people too. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I \r\n    would not like to eat from them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it was planted before the mosque was built and was given \r\n    as a waqf along with it, then if (the donor) specified how (the fruits) were \r\n    to be disposed of, his wishes should be followed, otherwise it should be \r\n    given to the heirs of the donor, both rich and poor, as a waqf to them \r\n    according to their shares of inheritance. They are entitled to it as an \r\n    inheritance. If he has no relatives then it is for the poor and needy as a \r\n    waqf for them. al-Muwaffaq said: It is permissible to eat from it, and this \r\n    is the view of Imam Ahmad according to the report narrated by Abu Taalib. \r\n    ... A number of our companions said: It should be (sold and the money) spent \r\n    on the mosque, and if there is no need of it then its neighbour may eat the \r\n    fruits. He stated this in <i>al-Faa&rsquo;iq<\/i>. But he stated the former view, \r\n    that if no particular recipient is stipulated then it is like a waqf for \r\n    which no recipient were stipulated, in <i>al-Iqnaa&rsquo;<\/i>, <i>al-Muntaha<\/i> \r\n    and <i>al-Ghaayah<\/i>. (2\/317).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Haashiyat al-Bujayrimi<\/i> (3\/103) it says: It is \r\n    makrooh to plant trees in the mosque as it says in al-Rawdah. I say: This is \r\n    to be understood as meaning that it is makrooh if it does not affect the \r\n    mosque or the worshippers, otherwise it is haraam and if it has been planted \r\n    it should be uprooted. The one who should uproot it is the imam or his \r\n    deputy, not individuals, whether it was haraam or makrooh to plant it, \r\n    because he has the right to remove makrooh things. But it is not permissible \r\n    to cut down that which was planted for the mosque and is not causing any \r\n    harm, because it belongs to the mosque. This was stated by al-Qaadi. But it \r\n    should be limited to that which bears fruits from which the mosque may \r\n    benefit, otherwise it should be removed. The basic principle dictates that \r\n    attention should be paid to whichever serves the greater interest: leaving \r\n    it or removing it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of things that were planted for the mosque but \r\n    deserve to be removed, it is not permissible to eat their fruits unless one \r\n    makes a donation to the mosque in return. If they were planted to provide \r\n    food for the sake of Allaah or the intention of the one who planted them is \r\n    unknown, it is permissible to eat from them without paying anything in \r\n    return. The same applies to the fruits of trees planted for the sake of \r\n    Allaah in the graveyard or if the intention of the one who planted it is not \r\n    known, and the same applies to plants that grew there by themselves. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said: Abu&rsquo;l-Khattaab said: In my view, if the \r\n    mosque needs the price of the fruits of the trees, they may be sold and the \r\n    price given towards upkeep of the mosque.

Based on this, bid&rsquo;ah does not \r\n    have to do with matters other than worship, rather things that are \r\n    introduced with regard to worldly matters should be examined to see if they \r\n    are halaal or haraam, but it cannot be said that they are bid&rsquo;ah. In \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah terminology, bid&rsquo;ah refers to when a person worships Allaah in a \r\n    manner other than that which He has prescribed. As for worldly innovations, \r\n    although they may be called innovations in linguistic terms, they are not \r\n    innovations in religious terms in the sense that they cannot be ruled to be \r\n    haraam, halaal, obligatory or mustahabb unless there is shar&rsquo;i evidence to \r\n    that effect. Based on that, we cannot say that the things that people invent \r\n    nowadays to make it easier to do acts or worship are bid&rsquo;ahs even if they \r\n    did not exist before, such as loudspeakers. Loudspeakers did not exist at \r\n    the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \r\n    rather they were invented recently, but they serve a religious purpose by \r\n    conveying to the people the prayer, recitation and khutbah of the imam. \r\n    Similarly in lectures they serve a useful purpose, so they are good, and \r\n    buying them for the mosque for this purpose is something that is prescribed \r\n    and for which a person will be rewarded.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Another example is the \r\n    recent development of having carpets in our mosques in which there are lines \r\n    so that the rows may be made straight.&nbsp; Even though this is something new, \r\n    it is a means of doing something that is prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah, so it is \r\n    permissible or allowed for a purpose. It is well known to the people that \r\n    the imams were keen to straighten the rows and they paid attention to that \r\n    before these lines came along, and they would face some problems, such as if \r\n    someone stood too far forward, they would tell him to go back, and if \r\n    someone stood too far back, they would tell him to come forward, and if \r\n    necessary to come further. That took a lot of effort. But now, praise be to \r\n    Allaah, the imam can say: Make your rows straight along the lines, and the \r\n    rows can be organized properly. This is an innovation in the sense that it \r\n    is something new, but it is not an innovation in shar&rsquo;i terms, because it is \r\n    a means of achieving something that is required by sharee&rsquo;ah.

If the voice reaches the women in their \r\n    part of the mosque and they are able to follow the imam, then it is valid \r\n    for them to pray in congregation with the imam, because it is all one place, \r\n    and it is possible to follow either hearing the voice through loudspeakers \r\n    or hearing the imam&rsquo;s voice directly, or by hearing the voice of the one who \r\n    repeats the imam&rsquo;s takbeer.

This is what al-Ghazaali \r\n    said and what others of our companions mentioned, and it is as they said, \r\n    because it is not permissible to destroy this wealth or throw it into the \r\n    sea.

But if negative consequences are feared as a result of \r\n    picking it up, such as enmity or hatred and so on, then it should not be \r\n    picked up, because warding off negative consequences takes precedence over \r\n    bringing benefits. If Allaah knows from your intention that were it not for \r\n    this prayer mat you would be in his place, then Allaah will give you the \r\n    reward of those who sit in the front rows, because you only left this place \r\n    in the front row for a reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The phrase &ldquo;so long as the time for prayer has not yet come&rdquo; \r\n    means that if the time for prayer has come and the iqaamah has been given, \r\n    then we may pick up the prayer mat, because in this case it has no sanctity \r\n    or protection, and because if we leave it, there will be a gap in the row, \r\n    and that is contrary to the Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An exception is made to the correct view that it is haraam to \r\n    put down the prayer mat. If a man is in the mosque and he puts his prayer \r\n    mat down in the first row, or anything else to indicate that he is reserving \r\n    this spot, then he goes to the back of the mosque to sleep, or to read \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan or another book, then in this case he is entitled to do that, \r\n    because he is still in the mosque. But if the rows started to fill, then he \r\n    has to go back to his spot, so that he will not be stepping over people&rsquo;s \r\n    necks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another exception is that mentioned by the author:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever gets up from his spot for some reason, then he comes \r\n    back to it soon afterwards, he has more right to it. If a person has \r\n    reserved a spot and he goes out of the mosque for a valid reason, then he \r\n    comes back, he has more right to it. A valid reason is something like \r\n    needing to do wudoo&rsquo;, or if anything happens to him that makes him go out. \r\n    If he goes out, when he comes back he has more right to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the author stipulated that he should come back quickly. \r\n    The apparent meaning of the author&rsquo;s words is that if he takes a long time \r\n    to come back, he does not have more right to it, and anyone else may sit \r\n    there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars said that he does have the right to it, \r\n    even if he comes back after a long time, so long as the excuse was still in \r\n    effect. This view is more correct, because the continuation of the excuse is \r\n    like the beginning of it. If it is permissible for him to leave the mosque \r\n    and to leave the prayer mat there when the excuse first appears, then if the \r\n    excuse continues it is still permissible. But it is well known that if the \r\n    iqaamah for prayer is given and he is still absent, then his prayer mat \r\n    should be picked up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Rawd<\/i>: The majority did not limit it to \r\n    coming back soon, i.e., the majority of the companions of Imam Ahmad did not \r\n    limit it to coming back soon, as is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But what we have \r\n    mentioned is the middle view, i.e., that if he comes back after a long time \r\n    because the excuse continued, then he has more right to it, but if the \r\n    excuse ceased, but he was careless and took a long time, then he no longer \r\n    has more right to it.

Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) has spoken in detail on this \r\n    issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \r\n    his commentary on <i>Zaad al-Mustaqni&rsquo;<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The phrase &ldquo;and the same applies if he is outside and sees \r\n    the imam or the congregation&rdquo; means that a person&rsquo;s following the imam is \r\n    valid if he is outside the mosque, on condition that he can see the imam or \r\n    the congregation. The apparent meaning of the author&rsquo;s words is that it is \r\n    not conditional upon the rows (of worshippers) being uninterrupted. So if it \r\n    is assumed that a person is a neighbour of the mosque and he can see the \r\n    imam or the congregation from his window and he prays in his house, and \r\n    there is someone with him so that he is not praying alone, then it is valid \r\n    for him to follow this imam, because he can hear the takbeer and see the \r\n    imam or the congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The apparent meaning of the author&rsquo;s words is that he has to \r\n    see the imam or congregation throughout the entire prayer, so that he will \r\n    not miss following the imam. The view of our madhhab is that it is \r\n    sufficient for him to see them for part of the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So, if he is outside the mosque, two conditions must be met:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That he can hear the takbeer<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That he can see the imam or the congregation, either \r\n    throughout the entire prayer, according to the apparent meaning of the \r\n    author&rsquo;s words, or for part of the prayer, according to the view of our \r\n    madhhab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The apparent meaning of his words is that it is not essential \r\n    for the rows (of worshippers) to be uninterrupted, if the person is praying \r\n    outside the mosque. This is the view of our madhhab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second view &ndash; which is that of the author of <i>al-Muqni&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    is that the rows (of worshippers) must be uninterrupted, and that it is not \r\n    valid for one who is outside the mosque to follow the imam unless the rows \r\n    are joined to one another, because what counts in congregational prayer is \r\n    for all the worshippers to be doing the same things at the same time, \r\n    following one imam in one place. But we say that if the imam and the \r\n    worshippers are in the same mosque, and there are two other worshippers in \r\n    another room between which and the mosque there is some distance, and \r\n    another two in a third room, undoubtedly this is splitting up the \r\n    congregation, especially according to the view of those who say that prayer \r\n    in congregation must be offered in the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view with regard to this matter is that it is \r\n    essential for those who follow the imam from outside the mosque there should \r\n    be no interruption in the rows; if there is any interruption in the rows \r\n    then their prayer is not valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: there are buildings around the Haram, in which \r\n    are apartments in which people pray. Those people can see the imam or the \r\n    congregation for all or part of the prayer. According to the words of this \r\n    author, their prayer is valid, but we say to them: if you hear the iqaamah \r\n    then you can stay where you are and pray with the imam, and not come to \r\n    al-Masjid al-Haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the second opinion, the prayer is not valid, \r\n    because the rows are interrupted. This is the correct view, which refutes \r\n    the fatwa that stated by some contemporary scholars, that it is permissible \r\n    to follow the imam in a prayer that is being broadcast. He wrote an essay \r\n    concerning that, entitled <i>al-Iqnaa&rsquo; bi Sihhat Salaat al-Ma&rsquo;moom khalfa \r\n    al-midhaa&rsquo;<\/i>. This view implies that we need not pray Jumu&rsquo;ah in the \r\n    Friday mosques, rather we can follow the imam of al-Masjid al-Haraam, \r\n    because in that way we will have a larger congregation and that will be \r\n    better, even though the one who follows a prayer broadcast on the radio \r\n    cannot see the congregation or the imam, and if it comes by TV which \r\n    broadcasts the prayer live, it is more likely to be appropriate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But this is undoubtedly a false view, because it leads to \r\n    abolishing of prayer in congregation and Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer, and the rows (of \r\n    worshippers) are interrupted in this case, and it does not achieve the \r\n    purpose for which the Lawgiver enjoined prayer in congregation and Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who follows a broadcast prayer is not praying behind \r\n    an imam who is in front of him, rather there is a huge distance between \r\n    them, and this opens the door to evil, because the one who is careless about \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer could then say that so long as it is valid to follow a prayer \r\n    broadcast on the radio or TV, then I am going to pray at home, with my son \r\n    or brother etc, and we will form a row.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the correct view is that it is not valid to follow the \r\n    prayer outside the mosque unless the rows are uninterrupted, and two \r\n    conditions must be met:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the worshipper can hear \r\n    the takbeer<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the rows be uninterrupted.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to seeing \r\n    the imam or congregation, this is a matter that is subject to scholarly \r\n    debate. But so long as the takbeer can be heard and the rows are \r\n    uninterrupted, then it is valid to follow the imam. Based on this, if the \r\n    mosque is full and the rows are uninterrupted, and people pray in the market \r\n    places and outside shops, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/297-300.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows best<\/span>.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5335","question_id":"5335","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    I do not know of anything wrong with that, and I do not know \r\n    of any evidence for those who ban them, but if the beggars step over \r\n    people&rsquo;s necks and walk between the rows, then they should be stopped from \r\n    doing that, because by doing that they are disturbing the worshippers. \r\n    Similarly at the time of the Friday khutbah, they should be prevented \r\n    because it is obligatory for them and other worshippers to listen \r\n    attentively and because their begging at this time will distract others from \r\n    listening to the khutbah.

No one can use this as evidence that it is permissible to build structures over graves or to take graves as places of worship, or to bury people inside mosques, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth quoted above which forbid that.

So it is prescribed to &ldquo;greet&rdquo; \r\n          the mosque (by praying two rak&rsquo;ahs), unlike other places.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          If there is a mosque nearby, it is obligatory to go there \r\n          to pray, but if the mosque is far away and the adhaan cannot be heard \r\n          from afar, then in this case it is permissible to pray in the musallas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Those who call people to Allaah should be wise and should \r\n          encourage the students to pray in the mosques without putting them off \r\n          from praying in congregation altogether. For some ignorant people may \r\n          give up praying altogether when they see the harshness of some of the \r\n          daa&rsquo;iyahs. So we must pay attention to this and call people in a good \r\n          manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

I gave them the analogy of \r\n    another example from the Sunnah, where in another story the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered the one who needed to \r\n    spit whilst praying to spit to his left or beneath his feet.

He said: The hadeeth refers to a different \r\n    situation. He said: The mosques now have mats spread on the ground&nbsp; and they \r\n    are not as they used to be.

It is an evil deed\r\n    (sayi&#146;ah) to disturb the people in the mosque by talking about worldly affairs,\r\n    because this is offensive to them and distracts Muslims from doing acts of worship\r\n    properly.

The fact that there was no partition at the\r\n    time of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was either because\r\n    there was no need for it or because there was a reason why they could not have a\r\n    partition.

The Messenger <img>\r\n\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves, such as\r\n      the graveyard of al-Baqee&rsquo;, and he <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n      be upon him)<span>&nbsp; <\/span>visited the\r\n      graves of the shuhadaa&rsquo; (martyrs) and made du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for them. This is\r\n      something which is well known. What is forbidden is travelling\r\n      specifically to visit graves. This is something which we should not do,\r\n      according to the hadeeth of Abu Sa&rsquo;eed. Hence al-Qaadi &lsquo;Iyaad\r\n      al-Maaliki said: It is not permissible to travel specifically to visit\r\n      graves. This was also the view of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, Ibn &lsquo;Aqeel, Ibn\r\n      Battah and a group of scholars. All that was said to you is not correct,\r\n      as we have explained to you.

The one who looks at the general \r\n    meaning of the words of the fuqaha&rsquo; will say that it is part of the mosque, \r\n    because the room that is enclosed within the wall of the mosque is regarded \r\n    as part of the mosque. But for the one who thinks that it was not built to \r\n    be part of the mosque and that it is a room for the imam, it is like the \r\n    apartments of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The \r\n    doors of the apartments of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) opened on to the mosque but they were (separate) houses, and the \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not go out to them \r\n    when he was in i&rsquo;tikaaf. So to be on the safe side we say that the one who \r\n    is observing i&rsquo;tikaaf should not do so in such rooms.

So tahiyyat al-masjid \r\n    should not be offered when entering it, i&rsquo;tikaaf is not valid there, it is \r\n    not haraam to buy and sell there, because it is not part of the mosque as it \r\n    is separate from it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the third case, which is when the library has two doors, \r\n    one of which is inside the mosque and the other is outside: if the wall of \r\n    the mosque encompasses it then it is part of the mosque and the rulings on \r\n    mosques apply to it. If it is not encompassed by it; rather it has its own \r\n    separate wall, then it does not come under the same rulings as the mosque, \r\n    because it is separate from the mosque. Hence the houses of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not part of his mosque, even \r\n    though they had doors opening into the mosque, because they were separate \r\n    from it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    14\/351.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5395","question_id":"5395","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with your staying in one of the rooms \r\n    attached to the mosque or with teaching the children and using the computer, \r\n    projector, blackboard and other means that help in teaching.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is also nothing wrong with offering biscuits and juice \r\n    to the children in the mosque, so long as you teach them to avoid causing \r\n    any nuisance and to be keen to keep it clean.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person goes out of the mosque and intends to come back \r\n    soon, then he does not need to pray tahiyyat al-masjid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: I entered the mosque and prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs to &ldquo;greet the mosque&rdquo;, \r\n    then I went out intending to return.

In this case he does not have to pray tahiyyat al-masjid, \r\n    because the time was short. But if the time was long, then he should pray \r\n    two rak&rsquo;ahs. All of us, when we have prayed Zuhr, leave the mosque with the \r\n    intention of coming back to pray &lsquo;Asr, but can we say when we come back to \r\n    pray &lsquo;Asr that we should not pray tahiyyat al-masjid? No, we should pray it. \r\n    What matters is that if it is for some errand and we will come back quickly, \r\n    then we do not have to pray tahiyyat al-masjid and the first time we did it \r\n    is sufficient. The evidence for that is that the Messenger of Allah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the one who is \r\n    observing i&rsquo;tikaaf to go out to his house if he needs to and then come back. \r\n    This indicates that going out for a brief time is not regarded as leaving \r\n    the mosque.

So the people \r\n    shunned us, or their attitude towards us changed, until it seemed to me that \r\n    the land itself had turned hostile towards me and was no longer the land \r\n    that I knew. We stayed like that for fifty days. As for my two companions, \r\n    they stayed in their houses weeping, but I was the youngest and strongest of \r\n    them. I would go out and attend the prayer, and go around in the \r\n    marketplaces, and no one would speak to me. I would go to the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah (S) and greet him with salaam, when he was sitting with the people \r\n    after prayer, and I would say to myself: Did his lips move in response or \r\n    not? Then I would pray close to him, stealing glances at him. When I focused \r\n    on my prayer, he would look at me, then when I looked at him he would turn \r\n    away.&nbsp; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2757) and Muslim (2769).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When the Khawaarij manifested their bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) and \r\n    separated from the main body of the Muslims because of the idea and \r\n    innovations they introduced, none of the Sahaabah ordered that they be \r\n    removed or expelled from the mosques, because they are houses which Allaah \r\n    has given permission to be built and His name mentioned in them. So it is \r\n    not right for anyone to forbid that for which Allaah has given permission.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib said concerning the Khawaarij: &ldquo;They have \r\n    three rights over us: that we should not initiate fighting with them so long \r\n    as they do not fight us; that we should not prevent them from entering the \r\n    mosques of Allaah to mention His name therein; and that we should not deny \r\n    the booty to them so long as they have fought alongside us.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i> (7\/562) \r\n    with a hasan isnaad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is prescribed in your case is to treat them kindly in \r\n    the house of Allaah, and to strive to explain the Sunnah to them by all \r\n    means. If you can prevent them from establishing their bid&rsquo;ah, after asking \r\n    the scholars and making sure that this particular action is indeed bid&rsquo;ah, \r\n    then you may prevent them from doing this bid&rsquo;ah only, but you cannot \r\n    prevent them from entering the mosque altogether. That is subject to the \r\n    condition that preventing this bid&rsquo;ah will not lead to trouble among the \r\n    Muslims or to an evil that is greater than the bid&rsquo;ah that you want to \r\n    prevent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, if the person or group combines good with evil \r\n    in such a way that they cannot be separated, rather they will do it all or \r\n    abandon it all, then it is not permissible merely to enjoin good or forbid \r\n    evil, rather you should look and see. If the good is more prevalent, then it \r\n    should be enjoined, even if that will entail a lesser amount of evil, and \r\n    you should not forbid an evil if that means that a greater amount of good \r\n    will be lost. In that case, forbidding evil would be more akin to blocking \r\n    the path of Allaah and striving to stop people from obeying Him and His \r\n    Messenger, and to stop people doing good. But if the evil is more prevalent \r\n    then it should be forbidden, even if that means that a lesser amount of good \r\n    will be lost. In that case, enjoining that good which entails a greater \r\n    amount of evil is in fact enjoining evil and striving to disobey Allaah and \r\n    His Messenger. If the good and evil are equal, then you should neither \r\n    enjoin nor forbid, rather in some cases it will be better to enjoin (the \r\n    good) and in some cases it will be better to forbid (the evil), and in some \r\n    cases neither enjoining good nor forbidding evil will be appropriate, \r\n    because the good and evil are so strongly connected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That has to do with specific issues. But when speaking about \r\n    specific actions, then good should be enjoined in general and evil should be \r\n    forbidden in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to a single person or group, then its good should \r\n    be enjoined and its evil should be forbidden; its praiseworthy actions \r\n    should be commended and its blameworthy actions should be criticized, in \r\n    such a way that enjoining good will not cause most of the good to be lost or \r\n    a greater evil to occur, and in such a way that forbidding evil will not \r\n    cause a greater evil to occur or a greater good to be lost. If the matter is \r\n    unclear then the believer should wait until the truth is clear to him, so \r\n    that he will not do an act of obedience without the proper knowledge and \r\n    intentions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (28\/129-130); <i>\r\n    al-Istiqaamah<\/i> (2\/217-218).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have Shi&rsquo;ah with us at work. Is it permissible for us to \r\n    return their salaams?

If they greet you with \r\n    salaam, then return their salaams. It is not good to expel them from the \r\n    mosque, rather some of them may be from among the common folk who do not \r\n    know anything and have been misled by their scholars. If you are clever and \r\n    call them in ways that are better, you may be able to influence them. Using \r\n    violence is not something that is narrated in sharee&rsquo;ah. Allaah loves \r\n    kindness in all things. Now if you oppose them and say &ldquo;Do not prostrate on \r\n    pieces of paper, do not prostrate on stones&rdquo; and the like, if the matter may \r\n    be settled there and they will give up these things, that is good. But (the \r\n    problem is that) they will persist, and the enmity and hostility between you \r\n    will increase. What I think you must do is advise them first, especially the \r\n    ordinary people. Advising does not mean attacking their madhhab and false \r\n    religion. No, advising means explaining the truth to them and teaching them \r\n    the Sunnah. Then after that, if you explain the Sunnah to them, I am \r\n    absolutely certain that if they have real faith, they will come back to the \r\n    Sunnah and give up their falsehood. If that happens, then that is better. If \r\n    it does not happen, then you should treat them as they treat you. As for \r\n    expelling them from the mosque, you have no right to do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Liqaa&rsquo;aat al-Baab il-Maftooh<\/i> \r\n    (no. 80, question no. 4).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We should point out to you that not everyone who does an act \r\n    of bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) is an innovator, and not everything that you regard \r\n    as bid&rsquo;ah is necessarily an innovation. It is not permissible to take as a \r\n    reference point in this issue the junior seekers of knowledge or those who \r\n    are zealous about the Sunnah. They themselves need guidance, care and \r\n    advice. For example, they may think that clasping the hands to the chest \r\n    after rukoo&rsquo; (bowing) is a bid&rsquo;ah. Do they judge the one who does that as an \r\n    innovator? Do they want to expel such people from the mosques?

This is \r\n    like evidence that the multiplied reward for praying in Makkah applies to \r\n    all of the Haram, not just the Mosque which is the place of tawaaf, and the \r\n    words &ldquo;one prayer in al-Masjid al-Haraam is better than a hundred prayers in \r\n    my mosque&rdquo; are like the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): <i>\r\n    &ldquo;So let them not come near Al&#8209;Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah)&rdquo; [al-Tawbah 9:28]<\/i> \r\n    and <i>&ldquo;Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) Who took His slave (Muhammad\r\n    <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) for a journey by \r\n    night from Al&#8209;Masjid Al&#8209;Haraam (at Makkah)&rdquo; [al-Isra&rsquo; 17:1]<\/i>.

Hence in <i>al-Muntaqa<\/i> he \r\n    mentioned the story of al-Hudaybiyah as narrated by Ahmad and al-Bukhaari, \r\n    then he mentioned a report which was narrated only by Ahmad, in which he \r\n    said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) used to pray in the Haram when he was staying outside the sanctuary. \r\n    This report is narrated from Ibn Ishaaq from al-Zuhri, but Ibn Ishaaq is \r\n    mudallis.

She came to Maymoonah, \r\n    the wife of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to \r\n    greet her, and told her about that. Maymoonah said to her: Stay here and eat \r\n    the provisions you made, and pray in the Mosque of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for I heard the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;One prayer therein is \r\n    better than a thousand prayers offered in any other mosque, except the \r\n    mosque of the Ka&rsquo;bah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Muslim (1397) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No journey should be undertaken to visit any \r\n    mosque but three: this mosque of mine, al-Masjid al-Haraam and Masjid \r\n    al-Aqsa.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is a clear statement that what is meant by al-Masjid \r\n    al-Haraam in these two ahaadeeth is the mosque in which the Ka&rsquo;bah is, and \r\n    it does not apply to Makkah or the Haram in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: Is there the same reward in the other mosques of Makkah as in \r\n    al-Masjid al-Haraam?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: The answer to the question is there the same \r\n    reward in the other mosques of Makkah as in al-Masjid al-Haraam? is no, the \r\n    other mosques of Makkah are not the same as al-Masjid al-Haraam in terms of \r\n    reward, rather the multiple reward is only in al-Masjid al-Haraam, both the \r\n    older parts and the extensions, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;One prayer in this mosque of mine is \r\n    better than a thousand prayers anywhere else except the mosque of the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim. So the ruling applies only to the mosque of the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah, and the mosque of the Ka&rsquo;bah alone. Just as the multiplication of \r\n    reward for prayers applies only to the Mosque of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it also applies only to al-Masjid \r\n    al-Haraam. This is also indicated by the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;No journey should be undertaken to \r\n    visit any mosque but three: this mosque of mine, al-Masjid al-Haraam and \r\n    Masjid al-Aqsa.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is well known that if we undertake a journey to visit \r\n    any of the mosques of Makkah apart from al-Masjid al-Haraam, this is not \r\n    prescribed, rather it is forbidden. The one to which a journey should be \r\n    undertaken is the one in which there is the multiple reward, but praying in \r\n    the mosques of Makkah, and indeed in any part of the Haram, is better than \r\n    praying outside the sanctuary. The evidence for that is the fact that when \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) halted at \r\n    al-Hudaybiyah, part of which is outside the sanctuary and part of which is \r\n    in the Haram, he would pray inside the Haram even though he was staying \r\n    outside of it. This indicates that praying inside the Haram is better, but \r\n    it does not indicate that one attains the multiple reward that is applicable \r\n    only to the mosque of the Ka&rsquo;bah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it were said: How should we respond to the words of Allaah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) \r\n    Who took His slave (Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) \r\n    for a journey by night from Al&#8209;Masjid Al&#8209;Haraam (at Makkah)&rdquo; [al-Isra&rsquo; \r\n    17:1], <\/i>when he was taken on the Isra&rsquo; (Night Journey) from Makkah from \r\n    the house of Umm Haani&rsquo;?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that it is proven in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> \r\n    that he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was taken on the \r\n    Isra&rsquo; from al-Hijr. He said: &ldquo;Whilst I was sleeping in the Hijr, someone \r\n    came to me&hellip;&rdquo; The Hijr is inside al-Masjid al-Haraam.

In the Sunnah it is proven via \r\n    several isnaads that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Mounts are not to be prepared for travelling to any mosques \r\n    except three: al-Masjid al-Haraam, al-Masjid al-Aqsa and this mosque of \r\n    mine.&rdquo; Another example is al-Masjid al-Kabeer. One of the mosques on the \r\n    route between Makkah and Madeenah is called al-Masjid al-Akbar, as it says \r\n    in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i>; similarly a mosque may be called al-Jaami&rsquo; \r\n    al-Kabeer.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Calling a mosque by a name \r\n    that is not connected to any facts in order to distinguish it and by which \r\n    it may be known is a phenomenon that is widespread nowadays because many \r\n    mosques are being built, praise be to Allaah, in Muslim lands, in cities and \r\n    in villages, even in a single neighbourhood. So mosques are given names to \r\n    distinguish them, and names are chosen to call the mosque after one of the \r\n    prominent figures of Islam among the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them) and the Taabi&rsquo;een who followed them in truth, such as Masjid Abi Bakr \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him), Masjid &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) and so on, to distinguish them from one another. There does not seem to \r\n    be anything wrong with giving mosques names like these, especially since it \r\n    is known that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    gave names to his weapons, furnishings, mounts and clothes, as was stated by \r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) at the beginning of his book <i>\r\n    Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Naming a mosque after one \r\n    of the names of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as Masjid \r\n    al-Rahmaan, Masjid al-Quddoos, Masjid al-Salaam. It is well known that \r\n    Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And the mosques are for \r\n    Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah&rdquo; [al-Jinn 72:18]<\/i>. \r\n    All the mosques are for Allaah, without needing to be singled out, so \r\n    calling a mosque by one of the names of Allaah so as to distinguish it from \r\n    other mosques is an innovated matter which was not done in the past, so it \r\n    is better not to do it. And Allaah is the guide to the straight path.

This name, among the scholars, is a kind of praise and \r\n    mentioning something good, so calling a mosque by this name is something \r\n    sound and there is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This ruling has to do with \r\n    the general principles, but before applying it to your mosque, we should \r\n    look at the situation in your land. If attributing yourself to Ahl \r\n    al-Hadeeth, or calling yourself by their name, or calling your mosque &ldquo;Ahl \r\n    al-Hadeeth&rdquo; will result in creating division among the Muslims, or stir up \r\n    resentment in their hearts, or revive jaahili tribalism and create fitnah \r\n    and troubles among the Muslims, then it is better not to use this name, and \r\n    even avoid permissible matters of higher importance if doing them will \r\n    result in any of these evils. All that can be said about giving your mosque \r\n    this name is that it is a permissible matter that you decided to give up. \r\n    Among the permissible names you have those that will unite people and not \r\n    cause division, names that will attract people and not put them off, and \r\n    that should be sufficient. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) denounced calling with permissible names if the motive is \r\n    fanatical devotion to anything other than the truth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Jaabir \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>We were with the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a campaign, \r\n    when a man of the Muhaajireen hit a man of the Ansaar from behind. The \r\n    Ansaari said: O Ansaar! And the Muhaajir said: O Muhaajireen! The Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;What is \r\n    this call of Jaahiliyyah?&rdquo; They said: O Messenger of Allaah, a man of the \r\n    Muhaajireen hit a man of the Ansaar from behind. He said: &ldquo;Stay away from \r\n    it, it is disgusting.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari \r\n    (3518) and Muslim (4682).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>These two names &ndash; \r\n    Muhaajireen and Ansaar &ndash; are Islamically acceptable names which are \r\n    mentioned in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and Allaah called them by these names, \r\n    as Allaah calls us Muslims. For a man to attribute himself to the \r\n    Muhaajireen and Ansaar is something good and praiseworthy before Allaah and \r\n    His Messenger. It is not only permissible for the purpose of distinction, \r\n    such as when one attributes oneself to a tribe or country; it is not \r\n    something disliked or haraam, such as when one attributes oneself to \r\n    something that may lead to bid&rsquo;ah or sin. Nevertheless, when each of them \r\n    called a group to help him, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) denounced that and called it the call of Jaahiliyyah, until it \r\n    was said to him that those who were giving this call were young men, and \r\n    that did not come from the group, in which case he ordered that the \r\n    wrongdoer be stopped and the one who was wronged be helped.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Iqtida&rsquo; al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem<\/i> (71)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5405","question_id":"5405","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is only valid to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf in masjids, because \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And do not have sexual \r\n    relations with them (your wives) while you are in I&lsquo;tikaaf (i.e. confining \r\n    oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly \r\n    activities) in the mosques&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:187]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence in this verse indicates that if it (i&rsquo;tikaaf) \r\n    were valid in places other than the mosque, the prohibition on intimacy with \r\n    one&rsquo;s wife would not be singled out for prohibition there because \r\n    intercourse is contrary to i&rsquo;tikaaf according to scholarly consensus.

What is the ruling?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They replied&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If these mosques and places \r\n    where the Eid prayers and prayers for rain (istisqa&rsquo;) are offered were not \r\n    built near the graveyards because of the graveyards or to honour those who \r\n    were buried in them or to seek more reward for praying in them because they \r\n    are close to the graveyards, then building them for praying and drawing \r\n    closer to Allah in them is permissible, praying in them is acceptable and \r\n    frequenting them for the purpose of prayer and other acts of worship that \r\n    may be done there is something that is encouraged in Islam. If the \r\n    graveyards are surrounded with walls that separate them from the mosques, \r\n    that is sufficient. With regard to those that are not surrounded with walls, \r\n    walls should be built to separate them from the mosques and places where the \r\n    Eid prayers and prayers for rain (istisqa&rsquo;) are offered. If it is possible \r\n    to leave empty space between the walls of the mosques and places where the \r\n    Eid prayers and prayers for rain (istisqa&rsquo;) are offered, and the walls of \r\n    the graveyards, that is more on the safe side. But if the mosques were built \r\n    around the graveyards in order to venerate the graves, it is not permissible \r\n    to pray in them and they should be demolished, because building them in the \r\n    manner mentioned is one of the things that lead to shirk, i.e., associating \r\n    the occupants of the grave with Allah.

With regard to the prayer room or prayer place, it is a \r\n    place that a person uses to pray in, but he does not make it a place for \r\n    prayer on a permanent basis; rather he prays there if the time for prayer \r\n    comes. This is not a mosque. The evidence for that is the fact that the \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to offer naafil \r\n    prayers in his house, and his house was not a mosque. Similarly, &lsquo;Utbaan ibn \r\n    Maalik invited him to come to his house and pray in a place that &lsquo;Utbaan \r\n    could take as a prayer room or prayer place, and that place was not a \r\n    mosque.

That is because of the general meaning of the words of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The imam is \r\n    only appointed to be followed, so do not differ from him.

As for a more detailed discussion, we can sum up the issue of \r\n    the person praying behind an imam and the prostration of forgetfulness as \r\n    follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; If a \r\n    person offers the entire prayer with the imam, then the imam makes a mistake \r\n    and does the prostration of forgetfulness, he has to follow him, whether he \r\n    does the prostration before the salaam or after. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; If a \r\n    person joins the prayer late, and the imam makes a mistake in the part of \r\n    the prayer that he catches up with, then it depends: if the imam does the \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness before the salaam, the person praying behind \r\n    him should prostrate with him, then complete his prayer, then do the \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness once again, because the first prostration that \r\n    he did with the imam was not at the proper place for him, because the \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness cannot be done during the prayer, rather it \r\n    should be done at the end of the prayer, so his prostration with the imam \r\n    was merely for the purpose of following the imam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam \r\n    prostrates after the salaam, then the person who joined the prayer late \r\n    should not prostrate with him, rather he should stand up and complete his \r\n    prayer and say the salaam, then do the prostration of forgetfulness and say \r\n    the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; If the \r\n    person praying behind the imam joined the prayer late, and the imam made a \r\n    mistake in the part of the prayer that he did not catch up with, such as if \r\n    he made a mistake in the first rak&rsquo;ah and the person joined the prayer in \r\n    the second rak&rsquo;ah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam \r\n    prostrates before the salaam, the person praying behind him should follow \r\n    him, then complete his prayer, but he does not have to prostrate again \r\n    because the ruling on his imam&rsquo;s mistake does not apply to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam \r\n    does the prostration after the salaam, the person praying behind him should \r\n    not follow him, and he does not have to prostrate after finishing his prayer \r\n    either, because the ruling on his imam&rsquo;s mistake does not apply to him, as \r\n    the mistake happened before he joined the imam in the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>All of these \r\n    cases apply when the mistake is made by the imam. If the mistake is made by \r\n    the person praying behind the imam, that is also subject to further \r\n    discussion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; If the \r\n    person praying behind the imam makes a mistake in his prayer, and he did not \r\n    join the prayer late, i.e. he caught up with all the rak&rsquo;ahs with the imam, \r\n    such as if he forgets to say &ldquo;<i>Subhaana Rabbiy al-&lsquo;Azeem<\/i> (Glory be to \r\n    my Lord the Most Great)&rdquo; when bowing, then he does not have to do the \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness, because the imam carries it for him. But if we \r\n    assume that the person made a mistake that invalidates one of the rak&rsquo;ahs, \r\n    such as if he forgot to recite al-Faatihah, then in that case he must stand \r\n    up when the imam says the salaam and repeat the rak&rsquo;ah that was invalidated \r\n    because of his mistake, then he should recite the tashahhud, say the salaam \r\n    and do the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; If the \r\n    person praying behind the imam makes a mistake in his prayer, and he joined \r\n    the prayer late, then he should do the prostration of forgetfulness whether \r\n    he made the mistake whilst he was praying with the imam or after he stood up \r\n    to complete the part of the prayer that he missed, because if he prostrates \r\n    he will not be differing from the imam, as the imam will already have \r\n    finished his prayer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See: <i>\r\n    Risaalah fi Ahkaam Sujood al-Sahw<\/i> by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah \r\n    knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5433","question_id":"5433","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are \r\n    two issues connected to this question.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Should \r\n    the one who joined the prayer late do the prostration of forgetfulness if he \r\n    forgets something in his prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bahooti \r\n    said in <i>Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat<\/i> (1\/232):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He (i.e., \r\n    the one who joined the prayer late) should also do the prostration of \r\n    forgetfulness in the following situations:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He should do the prostration of \r\n    forgetfulness with regad to the part of the prayer that he did with his \r\n    imam, even if he left the imam after that f or a reason. <\/span>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The one who joined the prayer \r\n    late should also do the prostration of forgetfulness if he forgets something \r\n    in the part of the prayer that he offers alone, which is what he makes up \r\n    after the imam has said the salaam, even if he prostrated with him because \r\n    of his (the imam&rsquo;s) mistake, because now he is praying alone.

A \r\n    person may be distracted whilst praying so only one-half of it, or \r\n    one-quarter, or one-tenth or less, is recorded for him, as it says in <i>\r\n    Saheeh al-Musnad<\/i>, 18400; Abu Dawood, 796.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But he has discharged \r\n    his duty, even if that happened a great deal.

If\r\n    he has left the mosque, he should not come back to do this sujood &ndash; he no longer has\r\n    to do it, which is unlike when he has said salaam before completing the prayer.

The question posed \r\nregards what to do when in doubt regarding the number of raka&rsquo;aat prayed, and the \r\nanswer is covered in the following points:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>First,<\/strong> definition of doubtfulness: when two possibilities are equally probable without \r\nknowing or feeling one is more likely true than the other.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Second,<\/strong> when one doubts after performing salaam: One should disregard such doubt. \r\nFor example, take the case of one who has completed praying dhuhr then questions \r\nafter finishing the prayer, &quot;Did I really pray four raka&rsquo;aat or only three?&quot; Such doubt \r\nshould be disregarded completely unless it is substantiated by clear and certain \r\nindications; otherwise, it opens the door to waswasah (the whispering of Satan) and \r\nunwarranted extraneous additions to the prayer.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Third,<\/strong> when one doubts during the prayer; this must fall into one of the following two \r\ncases:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>One can discern that one of the two possibilities about which one is in doubt is \r\nmore likely or more certain by virtue of one&rsquo;s prevalent feeling or most likely \r\ninclination: In this case, one should act according to his best assumption and \r\nperform the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. The evidence for this \r\nopinion is what was related by Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, may Allaah be pleased with him, that \r\nthe Prophet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) prayed either an extraneous addition or missed \r\nan essential part of the prayer (one of the narrators of the hadeeth was in doubt \r\nwhich). After saying &lsquo;salaam,&rsquo; it was said to him, <em>&quot;Oh Prophet of Allaah, has there \r\nbeen a new change in [the way of performing] the prayer?&quot; He <img>\r\n replied, &quot;Why \r\n[would you say that]?&quot; They responded, &quot;You prayed in such and such manner.&quot; \r\nSo he bent his legs and faced towards the qiblah and performed two prostrations \r\nthen performed tasleem (saying &lsquo;salaam&rsquo; to the right then the left). After facing \r\ntowards us, he said, &quot;If something new had been introduced regarding the \r\nprayers, I would have informed you about it. To the contrary, I am but a human \r\nlike you&#151;I forget as you forget, so if I forget, remind and inform me. If any of you \r\ndoubts during his prayer then he should try to discern the more certain and \r\ncorrect case, then complete the prayer based upon it, then perform tasleem, \r\nfollowed by two prostrations.&quot;<\/em> (Al-Bukhari, Fath Al-Baari #401).<\/li>\r\n<li>One cannot discern nor is there any prevalence apparent to indicate which of the \r\ntwo cases is more certain: In this case, one should assume the least of the two and \r\ncontinue based on this assumption, then perform the two prostrations of doubt after \r\ntasleem. An example of this would be one who while praying the dhuhr prayer is \r\ncompletely uncertain whether he has completed three or four raka&rsquo;aat and cannot \r\ndetermine which is more true. Thus, he would assume the lesser of the two, i.e. \r\nthree, and complete another raka&rsquo;ah then sit for the tashahhud, then prostrate two \r\nprostrations before saying &quot;salaam.&quot; The basis for this ruling is the hadeeth related \r\nby Abu Sa&rsquo;eed Al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said: the \r\nProphet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) said, <em>&quot;If any of you doubts during his prayer and \r\nhe does not know how many [raka&rsquo;aat] he has prayed, whether it is three or four, \r\nthen he should discard and cast away his doubt. He is to continue upon what one \r\nis sure of [i.e. the lesser] then perform two prostrations before making tasleem. If \r\nhe ends up [in reality] praying five [raka&rsquo;aat], then his prayer will be an \r\nintercession for him; and if he ends up completely the [requisite] four [raka&rsquo;aat] \r\nthen it is targheeman for shaytaan.&quot;<\/em> (targheeman: i.e., a way of vexing Satan and \r\nhumiliating and debasing him, as well as rejecting him as a result of his failure to \r\nachieve his desire of disturbing the worshipper.)

When he \r\n    had finished the prayer and the people were waiting for him to say the \r\n    tasleem, he said takbeer whilst sitting and prostrated twice before saying \r\n    the salaam, then he said the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning \r\n    one who omitted the obligatory part deliberately: His prayer is rendered \r\n    invalid.

Thus I am forced to offer a number of obligatory \r\n    prayers together at the same time, and sometimes it is more than three \r\n    obligatory prayers at once. What is the ruling on my prayer?

As for joining &lsquo;Asr and Maghrib, for example, that is \r\n    not permissible because it is not permissible to delay a prayer beyond its \r\n    time under any circumstances. Based on that, in this case, if she is afraid \r\n    that the time for the present prayer that cannot be joined with the \r\n    following prayer will end, then she should pray it in whatever way she can. \r\n    So if, for example, she is going to school at the time of &lsquo;Asr, and she \r\n    cannot pray &lsquo;Asr there, then she should join it with Zuhr at the time of \r\n    Zuhr, then go to school having done what is required of her. To sum up, it \r\n    is not permissible for a woman or anyone else to join two prayers that it is \r\n    not permitted to join, rather one may only join two prayers that it is \r\n    permitted to join, such as joining Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, at the time of the earlier \r\n    or later prayer, and joining Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; at the time of the earlier \r\n    or later prayer, when there is a need for that.

Before we give a detailed answer to your question, we\r\n    would like to mention the following points:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Operations of this nature are usually carried out by a team of surgeons,\r\n        where assistant surgeons work alongside the main surgeons so that they can take turns when\r\n        necessary.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Some operations are carried out by several doctors who play different\r\n        roles assigned to them according to their specialties. It is not always the case that one\r\n        doctor will do a whole lengthy procedure by himself from beginning to end. So you will see\r\n        that one makes the incision, another is a heart doctor, a third is specialized in\r\n        operating on blood vessels, then the first one comes back to sew up the incision at the\r\n        end. In some operations, the role of the specialist does not even take up half of the\r\n        entire time spent on the surgery.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The kinds of operations that take a very long time, such as ten hours or\r\n        more, are very rare indeed, few and far between.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>With regard to how a surgeon can do his prayers, the detailed answer is\r\n    as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The basic principle is that every prayer should be offered at the right\r\n        time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;Verily, the prayer is\r\n        enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.&#148; [al-Nisa&#146; 4:103]<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <\/i>\r\n      <li><p>If the operation is lengthy, the doctor can try to start after praying\r\n        one of the prayers at the beginning of its appointed time, and try to finish before the\r\n        end of the time for the following prayer, so that he offers each prayer within the\r\n        allotted time.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>He should try to arrange his schedule, as much as possible, in such a\r\n        way that the time allotted for the surgery does not overlap the time for two prayers in a\r\n        row. For example, he could start a lengthy procedure early in the morning, and continue\r\n        until just before the time for &#145;Asr, so that he can pray Zuhr at the right time, and\r\n        also give himself several hours to work uninterrupted. So, for example, if he begins an\r\n        operation at 8.00 a.m. and finishes at 2.00 p.m., he will have six hours in which to work\r\n        continuously, if he wishes.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>If he can go to pray at the right time during an operation, and other\r\n        members of the surgical team can do his work by taking turns, then they should do that. We\r\n        wonder, if doctors need to go to the washroom during an operation, what do they do? If the\r\n        surgical arrangements can take that possibility into account, and we know that some\r\n        surgeons take a short rest or have a snack during the time of surgery, whilst another\r\n        doctor takes over, then performing prayer is even more important than those things.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>If the above is not possible, then there is nothing wrong with combining\r\n        two prayers, such as joining Zuhr and &#145;Asr, and praying them at the later time, i.e.,\r\n        the time of &#145;Asr.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>In very rare cases, when the surgery lasts for a very long time, and the\r\n        time for two prayers has passed, such as when a surgeon starts before Zuhr and finishes\r\n        after Maghrib, and he could not leave to do his prayers, then he should pray according to\r\n        his circumstances. Indeed, he can even pray during the surgery, by starting his prayer\r\n        with the words &#147;Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great),&#148; reciting Qur&#146;aan and\r\n        tilting his head to indicate the rukoo&#146; (bowing) and sujood (prostration), as much as\r\n        he can, tilting it lower for the sujood than the rukoo&#146;. This is how fighters on the\r\n        front line pray when engaged in combat with the enemy during lengthy battles, or when\r\n        pursuing the enemy or being pursued. He should pray according to his circumstances, and <i>&#147;Allaah\r\n        burdens not a person beyond his scope&#148; [al-Baqarah 2:286 &#150; interpretation of the\r\n        meaning]<\/i>. Praise be to Allaah Who does not make the religion too hard for us.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>The evidence for these rulings is proven, and the sayings of the\r\n    scholars regarding prayer in different circumstances is well-known and widely-disseminated\r\n    in the books of Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence), which clearly indicates the flexibility of\r\n    this blessed religion and its ability to deal with all the new developments in the human\r\n    realm, ancient and modern. This is no wonder, for has it not been revealed by the\r\n    All-Wise, Praiseworthy and All-Knowing?<\/p>\r\n    <p>Finally, we call on you to hasten to enter the religion of Islam, which\r\n    guarantees happiness to the one who follows it in this world and the next, and offers\r\n    answers to all problems.

Do not worry yourself by\r\n      thinking about the ruling on one who misses one or two prayers and whether\r\n      he is a kaafir or not.\r\n      \r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>&nbsp;Whoever\r\n      deliberately misses a prayer exposes himself to the wrath of Allaah, and\r\n      the wise believer does not do something which he knows could result in\r\n      punishment, even if it is not kufr as such. The five daily prayers, and\r\n      all other acts of worship, and avoiding what is forbidden &#8211; none of this\r\n      can be achieved except with patience. These are things which people find\r\n      difficult by nature, because they come between a person and some of his\r\n      desires.The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n      &#8220;Paradise is surrounded by things which are disliked.&#8221; The issue of\r\n      prayer in Islam is very important. Hence the responsible adult is not let\r\n      off prayer for as long as he is alive and he is in his right mind. But\r\n      Allaah has made things easier for His slaves with regard to the duty of\r\n      praying. He allows us to join prayers and shorten them whilst travelling,\r\n      and He allows us to<span>&nbsp; <\/span>join\r\n      prayers when we are not travelling if not doing so will cause greater\r\n      hardship. He allows the sick person to pray according to what he can do,\r\n      standing, sitting or lying on his side. Hence we know that being busy\r\n      earning a living is not an excuse for not praying. But if there is some\r\n      unusual hardship involved, it is permissible to pray Zuhr and &#8216;Asr\r\n      together at the time of either of them, and to pray Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217;\r\n      together at the time of either of them.\r\n      \r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>&nbsp;Allaah\r\n      commanded us to stop trading in order to pray Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday prayers),\r\n      and He praised those who do not let trades or sales divert them from the\r\n      remembrance of Allaah. So strive to do the prayers on time and in\r\n      congregation. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n      said: &#8220;Praying in congregation is twenty-seven times better than praying\r\n      alone.&#8221;\r\n      \r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>&nbsp;Note\r\n      that praying regularly is one of the greatest means of attaining the mercy\r\n      of Allaah and His pleasure and His Paradise, which is the main goal.It is\r\n      also a means of making earning one&#8217;s provision easier, as Allaah says\r\n      (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><i><span>&#8220;And\r\n      enjoin al-salaah (the prayer) on<span>&nbsp; <\/span>your\r\n      family, and bepatient in offering them[i.e., the prayers].We ask not of\r\n      you a provision (i.e., to give Us something: money, etc.); We provide for\r\n      you.

He\r\n      prays for Allaah, he fasts for Allaah, he does Hajj for Allaah, and he\r\n      hopes for the reward of Allaah. When you say we do not get get paid to\r\n      pray like the imaams, this is a mistake in your way of<span>&nbsp;\r\n      <\/span>thinking. It is not permissible for the imaam to take a salary for\r\n      doing the prayers; imaams and muezzins are being paid for doing a job\r\n      which requires them to to be present at the mosque every time (so that\r\n      they can devote their time to doing their duties of leading prayers,\r\n      giving khutbahs, issuing fatwas and judging between people). But it is\r\n      better for a Muslim to fulfil the duties of an imaam or muezzin\r\n      voluntarily, hoping for the reward of Allaah. \r\n      \r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>&nbsp;When\r\n      you say we have families, children, etc&#8230; this is not an excuse for\r\n      missing some of the prayers.

This is longer than two hours, so it is possible \r\n    to pray Zuhr after the lesson ends, because she will still have some time \r\n    left. This applies if it is not possible for her to pray during the lesson \r\n    time; if that is possible then it is more on the safe side. If it so happens \r\n    that the lesson does not end before the time for &lsquo;Asr begins and it will be \r\n    too difficult for her to leave the lessons, then in that case it is \r\n    permissible for her to join Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr prayer and delay Zuhr until the \r\n    time for &lsquo;Asr, because of the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) which says that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) joined Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, and Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, in Madeenah when \r\n    there was no fear and no rain.&nbsp; He was asked about that and he (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) said: He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) did not want to cause hardship for his ummah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These words of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    indicate that the hardship and difficulty that a person may face make it \r\n    permissible for him to join the two prayers which may be joined together at \r\n    the time of either of them.

If a person is afraid of harm caused by rain or mud &ndash; i.e., if \r\n    it is raining and if he goes out to attend Jumu&rsquo;ah or prayers in \r\n    congregation he will be harmed by the rain, then he is excused.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Harm caused by rain means being harmed by his clothes getting \r\n    wet or by the cold weather and so on. The same applies if he is afraid of \r\n    being harmed by the mud. In the past, people used to suffer because of mud, \r\n    because the marketplaces had dirt floors, and when rain fell it became muddy \r\n    and slippery, so it was very difficult for people to attend the mosque. If \r\n    this happens, then he is excused. But nowadays, that does not cause any \r\n    problem, because the markets are paved and there are no dirt floors. The \r\n    worst that can happen is that you will find that the water ponds in some low \r\n    spots, but this does not affect people or their clothes or their feet. The \r\n    excuse in this case only applies if rain is falling, and when it stops there \r\n    is no excuse. But in some villages where there is no paving, the excuse may \r\n    still apply. Hence the caller of the Messenger (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) would call out on cold or rainy nights: &ldquo;Pray where you \r\n    are.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may be understood from the words &ldquo;or harm because of rain&rdquo; \r\n    that if a person will not be harmed by it because the rain is light, then \r\n    there is no excuse in that case; rather he has to attend the prayers, and \r\n    whatever minor hardship he is faced with, he will be rewarded for it.

This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, including the followers of the\r\n    four schools of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa&#146;i and Ahmad&#133; Shaykh al-Islam Ibn\r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Fataawa<\/i> (24\/178): &#147;The\r\n    correct opinion, without a doubt&#133; is that this (Jumu&#146;ah and Eid prayers) are not\r\n    obligatory for the traveller. The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) used to travel frequently: he performed &#145;Umrah three times, besides the\r\n    &#145;Umrah he performed along with Hajj. He performed his Farewell Pilgrimage accompanied\r\n    by thousands upon thousands of people, and he went on more than twenty military campaigns,\r\n    but there are no reports at all that say he prayed Jumu&#146;ah or Eid prayers when\r\n    travelling; he just prayed two rak&#146;ahs [i.e., shortened prayers] as on all the other\r\n    days. There are also no reports that say he preached a khutbah on a Friday when he was\r\n    travelling, neither standing on his own two feet or from atop his camel, as he used to do\r\n    on Eid, or from a minbar, as he used to do on Fridays. He occasionally used to deliver an\r\n    address to the people when he was travelling, and this was narrated by them&#133; but\r\n    no-one reported that he delivered a khutbah to them before prayer on a Friday whilst\r\n    travelling, and no-one reported that he recited Qur&#146;aan aloud on a Friday (i.e.,\r\n    during Salat al-Zuhr, on a journey). Of course, if he had done something out of the\r\n    ordinary and recited aloud or delivered a khutbah, they would have reported it. On the Day\r\n    of &#145;Arafaah, he delivered a khutbah, then he came down and led them in a\r\n    two-rak&#146;ah prayer, but no one reported that he recited aloud in that prayer. That\r\n    khutbah was not for Jumu&#146;ah &#150; because if it had been for Jumu&#146;ah, he would\r\n    have done the same (delivered a khutbah) on every other Friday (when he was travelling);\r\n    that khutbah was given because it was part of the rituals (of Hajj). Hence all the Muslim\r\n    scholars said that he would have given a khutbah at &#145;Arafaah even if it had not been\r\n    a Friday. This mutawaatir report proves that it was a khutbah for the Day of\r\n    &#145;Arafaah, not for Friday.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>From the above we know that Jumu&#146;ah is not obligatory for the\r\n    traveller, all that he has to do is to pray Zuhr.

Their\r\n    exemption from having to attend Jumu&#146;ah is to make things easy for them, but if they\r\n    attend, it is OK, as is the case with the sick person. It is preferable for the traveller\r\n    to attend Jumu&#146;ah, because this is better, and is on the safe side (because some\r\n    scholars think that Jumu&#146;ah is obligatory for the traveller who is staying in a\r\n    particular place, but not for the traveller who is on the road), as he comes under the\r\n    general meaning of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;O you who believe!\r\n    When the call is proclaimed for the Salaah on the Day of Friday (Jumu&#146;ah prayer),\r\n    come to the remembrance of Allaah, and leave off business (and every other thing), that is\r\n    better for you, if you did but know!&#148; [al-Jumu&#146;ah 62:9].<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>We have already stated that the majority of scholars say that generally\r\n    speaking it is not obligatory.

And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let \r\nthem pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish, if you were \r\ncareless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on \r\nyou if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take \r\n(every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating \r\npunishment.&quot;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>And in the following hadith:<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab &quot;Verily Allaah has \r\nsaid '&#133; if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you&#133;' and now the people \r\nfeel secure.&quot; 'Umar said, &quot;[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it \r\nto the Prophet <em><img>\r\n<\/em><em> <\/em>(peace be upon him) and he said '<em>[It is] a charity that Allaah has bestowed upon \r\nyou so accept His charity.'<\/em> &quot; (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.)<\/p>\r\n<p>Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn Abdullah ibn Khaalid ibn Asid said to Ibn 'Umar, &quot;How can \r\nyou shorten the prayer when Allaah the Almighty has said, <em>'there is no blame on you if you shorten \r\nyour prayers, for fear&#133;'<\/em> ,&quot; so Ibn 'Umar said, &quot;O son of my brother, verily the Prophet <em><img>\r\n<\/em><em> <\/em>(peace be \r\nupon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was \r\nthat Allaah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'a during travel.&quot; (Al-Shu'aithiy said that \r\nal-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.)<\/p>\r\n<p>The ayah expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically \r\nrestricting the distance.

If the imam is a resident (is not travelling) then you should \r\n    offer the prayer in full with him, and not shorten it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: If a person travels to Jeddah, for \r\n    example, is he allowed to shorten his prayers or does he have to pray with \r\n    the congregation in the mosque?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the traveller is still en route, it does not matter, but \r\n    if he has reached his destination then he should not pray on his own, rather \r\n    he has to pray with the people and offer the prayer in full. But if he is \r\n    still on the road and is alone and the time for prayer comes, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with him praying on his own and shortening the prayers whilst \r\n    travelling, making the four-rakah prayers two rak&rsquo;ahs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&rsquo;iah li&rsquo;l-Shaykh &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz<\/i> (12\/297).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked: when and how should a \r\n    traveller pray?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The traveller may pray two rak&rsquo;ahs from when he leaves his \r\n    city or town, until he returns to it, because &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her) said: &ldquo;When the prayer was first enjoined it was two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs, then the prayer of the traveller remained like that but the prayer \r\n    of one who is not travelling was increased to four.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari, 1090; Muslim, 685. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;We went out \r\n    with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from \r\n    Madeenah to Makkah, and we prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs each time, until we came back \r\n    to Madeenah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1081; Muslim, 693.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if a traveller prays with an imam he should pray four \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs, whether he catches up with the prayer from the beginning or he \r\n    misses part of it, because the general meaning of the Prophet&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;When \r\n    you hear the iqaamah, then walk to the prayer, and you should be tranquil \r\n    and dignified, and not rush. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever \r\n    you miss, complete it.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 636; Muslim, 602. The \r\n    general meaning of the phrase &ldquo;Whatever you catch up with, pray, and \r\n    whatever you miss, complete it&rdquo; includes travellers who pray behind an imam \r\n    who is offering a four-rak&rsquo;ah prayer, and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) was asked why a \r\n    traveller should pray two-rak&rsquo;ahs when he is alone and four when he prays \r\n    behind a resident. He said: &ldquo;That is the Sunnah.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 688; \r\n    Ahmad, 1865. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The obligation to pray in congregation is not waived for the \r\n    traveller, because Allaah has enjoined that even in the case of fighting. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;When you (O Messenger \r\n    Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salaah (the prayer), let one \r\n    party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with \r\n    them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in \r\n    the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let \r\n    them pray with you&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:102]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, if the traveller is in a city or town other \r\n    than his own, he has to attend prayers in congregation in the mosque if he \r\n    hears the call to prayer, unless he is far away or fears that he may miss \r\n    meeting up with his travelling companions, because of the general meaning of \r\n    the evidence which indicates that the one who hears the adhaan or iqaamah is \r\n    obliged to pray in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Rasaa&rsquo;il al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    15\/252.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He was also asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If I am travelling and I hear the call to prayer, do I have \r\n    to pray in the mosque?

The Messenger of Allaah (S) was never given the choice \r\n    between two things but he would choose that which was easier, so long as it \r\n    was not a sin, in which case he would be the most careful of people to avoid \r\n    it.

This view is stronger and is more on \r\n    the safe side.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is it conditional that he leave his village when he has \r\n    decided to travel and has prepared his means of transportation, before he is \r\n    allowed to break his fast?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that there are two views narrated from the \r\n    salaf. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible \r\n    to break the fast when he has made his preparations for travel and has \r\n    nothing left to do but get into his means of transportation. They narrated \r\n    that this is what Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to do. But if \r\n    you study the verse &ndash; <i>&ldquo;but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same \r\n    number (should be made up) from other days&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i> &ndash; you \r\n    will see that this view is not correct, because up to this point he is not \r\n    travelling; at this point he is still a resident.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, it is not permissible for him to break the \r\n    fast until he has left the houses of the town behind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But before leaving, he cannot do that, \r\n    because he is not yet travelling in a real sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that he should not break his fast until \r\n    he has left the village. Hence it is not permissible to shorten the prayers \r\n    until he has left the town, and likewise it is not permissible to break the \r\n    fast until he has left the town.

There are also some odd views \r\n    on this matter, such as the view of those who say that it is permissible to \r\n    shorten the prayers when he is still in his house, and the view of those who \r\n    say that he should not shorten his prayers if he travels during the day \r\n    until night comes, and a third view which is that it is permissible for him \r\n    to shorten his prayers when he has passed beyond the walls of his house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Our view is that when he \r\n    has passed beyond the buildings of the town, he may shorten his prayers, but \r\n    he should not shorten them before passing them, even if he has left his \r\n    house. This is the view of Maalik, Abu Haneefah, Ahmad and the majority of \r\n    scholars. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated from al-Haarith ibn Rabee&rsquo;ah that he \r\n    wanted to travel and he led them in praying two rak'ahs in his house. Among \r\n    them was al-Aswad ibn Yazeed and another of the companions of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood. \r\n    He said: And we narrated something similar from &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; and Sulaymaan ibn \r\n    Moosa. He said: and Mujaahid said: The traveller should not shorten his \r\n    prayers during the day until night comes. Ibn al-Mundhir said: We do not \r\n    know of anyone who agreed with him. Al-Qaadi Abu&rsquo;l-Tayyib and others \r\n    narrated that Mujaahid said: If he sets out during the day he should not \r\n    shorten his prayers until night comes, and if he sets out at night he should \r\n    not shorten his prayers until day comes. And it was narrated that &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; \r\n    said: When he has passed beyond the walls of his house, he may shorten his \r\n    prayers. These two views are incorrect. The view of Mujaahid is contrary to \r\n    the saheeh ahaadeeth which state that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) shortened his prayers in Dhu&rsquo;l-Hulayfah when he left \r\n    Madeenah. And the view of &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; and those who agree with him is contrary to \r\n    the idea of travelling.

So he \r\n    has to pray when he is still inside the built-up area, and he should offer \r\n    the prayers in full at the proper times, just like the residents, because he \r\n    has not yet started his journey. Even if he moves from one neighbourhood to \r\n    another on his way to his journey, he is not yet regarded as a traveller, \r\n    until he has passed beyond all the buildings and developed areas of the \r\n    town.

It is better for someone in your position to offer the prayer on \r\n    board the plane as soon as the time for prayer begins, before the plane \r\n    moves, because that will let him focus more fully on the prayer.

The definitively correct view is that the \r\n    prayer of the one praying behind the imam is valid even if the imam follows \r\n    the wrong view with regard to a disputed issue, because it is proven in <i>\r\n    al-Saheeh<\/i> that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;They lead in you in prayer, and if they do right, it is for you \r\n    and for them, and if they do wrong, it is for you and against them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, if the worshipper follows an imam who does qunoot \r\n    in Fajr or Witr, he should pray qunoot with him, whether that is before \r\n    bowing or after, and if he does not do qunoot, he should not do qunoot with \r\n    him. If the imam thinks that it is mustahabb to do a certain thing in prayer \r\n    but the one who is praying behind him does not think that is the case and he \r\n    (the imam) decides not to do it for the sake of harmony and unity, that is \r\n    better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of that is Witr, concerning which there are three \r\n    views among the scholars:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That it should be three rak&rsquo;ahs one after another, like \r\n    Maghrib, as was the view of some of the people of Iraq.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That it should only be one rak&rsquo;ah performed separately \r\n    from whatever comes before, as was the view of some of the people of the \r\n    Hijaz.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; That both are permissible, as is the apparent view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ahmad and others. This is correct view, although they preferred \r\n    that it should be done separately from whatever came before.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam thinks that \r\n    it should be done separately, and the congregation thinks that Witr should \r\n    be done like Maghrib, and he agrees to do that so as to create harmony, that \r\n    is better, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah: &ldquo;Were it not that your people have only recently left \r\n    Jaahiliyyah behind, I would have razed the Ka&rsquo;bah to the ground and rebuilt \r\n    it with two doors, one through which the people might enter and one through \r\n    which they might exit.&rdquo; But he decided not to do that which was better, lest \r\n    it put the people off.

Hence the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Let the \r\n    people be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Qur&rsquo;aan.

Other scholars said that it is valid for him to lead the prayer and \r\n    prayers offered behind him are valid, because he is a Muslim whose prayer is \r\n    valid in and of itself, so prayers offered behind him are valid, because \r\n    many of the Sahaabah prayed behind some rulers who were known to be \r\n    wrongdoers and evildoers, such as Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    who prayed behind al-Hajjaaj who was one of the greatest wrongdoers. This is \r\n    the correct view, which is that his prayers are valid, as are the prayers of \r\n    those who pray behind him. But he should not be appointed as an imam when it \r\n    is possible to appoint someone else who is good and righteous.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Baaz <\/i>(12\/123-127).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Shaykh (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was also asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is the ruling on \r\n    praying behind sinners such as those who shave their beards or smoke?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars differed \r\n    concerning this issue. Some are of the view that it is not valid to pray \r\n    behind a sinner, because he is weak in faith and not trustworthy. But a \r\n    large number of scholars are of the view that it is valid, but those who are \r\n    in authority should not appoint sinners to lead the people in prayer when \r\n    there are other people available. This is the correct view, because he is a \r\n    Muslim who knows that prayer is obligatory upon him and he does it on that \r\n    basis. So it is valid to pray behind him. The evidence for that is the \r\n    report in the saheeh hadeeth, that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said concerning prayer behind immoral rulers: &ldquo;They lead \r\n    you in prayer and if they do good then it will be for you and for them, but \r\n    if they do evil then it will be for you and against them.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari in <i>al-Adhaan<\/i> (662). And there are other ahaadeeth in \r\n    which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \r\n    something similar. And some of the Sahaabah prayed behind al-Hajjaaj even \r\n    though he was among the most evil of people, and because prayer in \r\n    congregation is essential, so the believer should be keen to do it and to \r\n    pray in congregation regularly even if the imam is an evildoer. But if it is \r\n    possible to pray behind an imam of good character, then that is better and \r\n    is preferable, and is more on the safe side with regard to religious \r\n    commitment. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Baaz<\/i> (6\/400).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Prayer offered behind a \r\n    smoker is valid, and the prayer of the smoker is valid.

The excuses are of two types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That includes something that makes the imam obliged to become \r\n    a member of the congregation, which is if he becomes unable to do any of the \r\n    obligatory parts of the prayer.

In that case he should appoint a member of the congregation \r\n    to take over. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (1\/944):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he is unable to complete al-Faatihah, then he may appoint \r\n    someone to take over leading them in prayer, because he has become unable to \r\n    do it. And it is permissible to appoint someone else, such as if he breaks \r\n    his wudoo&rsquo; by accident or if he becomes unable during the prayer to do an \r\n    essential part of the prayer, then he may appoint someone to complete the \r\n    prayer. End quote. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the imam has finished reciting al-Faatihah, then he is \r\n    overcome with weeping whilst reciting Qur&rsquo;aan after al-Faatihah, in that \r\n    case he may stop reciting and bow, and he does not have to do anything \r\n    else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa&rsquo;ib (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) led us in praying Fajr in Makkah, and he started to \r\n    recite Soorat al-Mu&rsquo;minoon, until he came to the passage that mentions Moosa \r\n    and Haroon, when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) was overcome by coughing, so he bowed. Narrated by Muslim (455).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Sharh \r\n    Muslim<\/i> (4\/177):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth shows that it is permissible to stop reciting \r\n    and it is not makrooh to do so, if one stops for a reason. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for him to appoint someone else to take \r\n    over in that case, because he is able to complete the prayer with the \r\n    people, doing only the essential parts of the prayer. There is no need for \r\n    him to continue reciting with difficulty when weeping, because reciting \r\n    something else in addition to al-Faatihah is not obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Mawaahib al-Jaleel<\/i> (2\/136) it is narrated that \r\n    al-Maaziri said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should not appoint someone to take over if he is prevented \r\n    from reciting part of the soorah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In such cases it is recommended that he try to control \r\n    himself as much as he can, so that he will not cause any hardship to the \r\n    other worshippers if his weeping goes on for too long, as that will have \r\n    some negative effects. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked in\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (11\/342): What is your opinion on the phenomenon \r\n    of weeping loudly?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I have advised many of those who have gotten in touch with me \r\n    to avoid doing this and that it is not appropriate, because it annoys people \r\n    and causes hardship to them, and it distracts other worshippers and those \r\n    who are reading Qur&rsquo;aan. What the believer should do is strive not to let \r\n    his voice be heard if he is weeping, and he should beware of showing off, \r\n    for the shaytaan may lead him to show off. He should not annoy anyone with \r\n    his voice, or disturb them. But it is known that some people do not do that \r\n    by choice, rather they get overwhelmed without meaning to. In this case it \r\n    is forgivable if he cannot help it. It is proven that when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited Qur&rsquo;aan, his chest would \r\n    heave like the boiling of a cauldron because of weeping. And it is narrated \r\n    that when Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) read Qur&rsquo;aan, he could \r\n    not make the people hear it because of weeping. And it is narrated that \r\n    &lsquo;Umar&rsquo;s sobs could be heard from behind the rows (of worshippers). But this \r\n    does not mean that the voice should be raised in weeping, rather it is \r\n    something that overwhelmed them because of their fear of Allaah. So if a \r\n    person is overcome with weeping and cannot help it, there is no sin on him \r\n    for that.

If he does not do that then \r\n    they have the choice of either completing the prayer individually or sending \r\n    one of their number forward to lead them in completing the prayer in \r\n    congregation.

The prayer of the imam may become invalid on the \r\n    grounds of sound evidence, but the person praying is following the command \r\n    Allaah and his prayer cannot be deemed invalid except with evidence to that \r\n    effect.

If a woman passes \r\n    between the imam and his sutrah, then the prayer of the imam and the prayer \r\n    of those who are praying behind him are both invalidated, because this \r\n    sutrah is shared by all of them. Hence we do not tell the people praying \r\n    behind the imam to use a sutrah, rather if they use a sutrah then this is \r\n    regarded as going to extremes and as an innovation.

We should not pray behind one \r\n    who does such things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked about praying behind al-muraaziqah and about their bid&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: It is permissible for a man to offer the five \r\n    daily prayers and Jumu&rsquo;ah etc behind a person whom he does not know to \r\n    engage in bid&rsquo;ah or evildoing, according to the consensus of the four Imams \r\n    and other imams of the Muslims. It is not one of the conditions of leading \r\n    prayers that the person praying behind the imam should know what his imam&rsquo;s \r\n    beliefs are, and he should not examine him by saying, &ldquo;What do you believe?&rdquo; \r\n    Rather he should pray behind the one whose situation he does not know. If he \r\n    prays behind one who he knows to be an evildoer or innovator, then there are \r\n    two well-known scholarly views concerning the validity of his prayer in the \r\n    madhhab of Ahmad and Maalik; the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Abu Haneefah is \r\n    that his prayer is valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the person knows that the imam is an innovator who calls \r\n    others to follow his bid&rsquo;ah, or an evildoer who commits evil openly, and he \r\n    is the regular imam and it is not possible to pray behind anyone else, such \r\n    as the imam for Jumu&rsquo;ah and Eid prayers, or the imam in Hajj prayers at \r\n    &lsquo;Arafah and so on, then he should pray behind him, according to the majority \r\n    of earlier and later scholars. This is the view of Ahmad, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Abu \r\n    Haneefah and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence they said concerning &lsquo;aqeedah: He should offer Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    and Eid prayers behind any imam, whether he is righteous or an evildoer. \r\n    Similarly, if there is only one imam in a village, then the prayers in \r\n    congregation should be offered behind him, because praying in congregation \r\n    is better than praying alone, even if the imam is an evildoer. This is the \r\n    view of the majority of scholars, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and others. \r\n    Prayer in congregation is obligatory for individuals according to the view \r\n    of Ahmad. Whoever abandons Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer and prayer in congregation behind \r\n    an imam who is an evildoer is an innovator according to Imam Ahmad and other \r\n    imams of al-Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that he should pray and not repeat the \r\n    prayers. The Sahaabah used to offer Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers and prayers in \r\n    congregation behind imams who were evildoers, and they did not repeat the \r\n    prayers. Ibn &lsquo;Umar used to pray behind al-Hajjaaj, and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and \r\n    others prayed behind al-Waleed ibn &lsquo;Uqbah, who used to drink wine. The \r\n    prayer of an evildoer or innovator is valid in and of itself, so if a person \r\n    prays behind him, his prayer is not invalid. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But with regard to those who disliked the idea of praying \r\n    behind one who is an evildoer, they based their view on the fact that \r\n    enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is obligatory. So one who \r\n    openly commits bid&rsquo;ah or evil should not be appointed as the regular imam \r\n    for the Muslims. He deserves to be rebuked until he repents, and if it is \r\n    possible to shun him until he repents, then that is good. If some of the \r\n    people stop praying behind him and pray behind someone else, that may affect \r\n    him and make him repent or withdraw or make the people stop committing sins \r\n    like his. Stopping praying behind such a man may serve a purpose so long as \r\n    people do not miss out on praying Jumu&rsquo;ah or other prayers in congregation. \r\n    But if stopping praying behind him means that people will miss out on \r\n    praying Jumu&rsquo;ah or other prayers in congregation, then in this case no one \r\n    will stop praying behind him but one who is an innovator and who goes \r\n    against the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 23\/351- 356&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: What is \r\n    the ruling on eating meat when nothing is known about the slaughterer&rsquo;s \r\n    &lsquo;aqeedah, or praying behind one whose &lsquo;aqeedah is unknown?

If there are less than twelve of ahl al-sunnah in a city, is Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    valid for them or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: It is obligatory to establish Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer \r\n    behind any imam, righteous or otherwise. If the bid&rsquo;ah of the imam for \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah does not put him beyond the pale of Islam, then he should pray \r\n    behind him. Imam Abu Ja&rsquo;far al-Tahhaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said \r\n    in his famous book <i>al-&lsquo;Aqeedah<\/i>: We think that prayer should be \r\n    offered behind any imam, righteous or otherwise, among the people of the \r\n    qiblah, and (the funeral prayer) should be offered for those of them who \r\n    die.

As for the \r\n    stipulation that there be forty or twelve or less or more in order to hold \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers, there is no reliable evidence for that as far as we know. \r\n    Rather what must be done is to establish prayers in congregation and the \r\n    smallest number for that is three.

As for the \r\n    rows for women, what is meant in this hadeeth is the rows of women who are \r\n    praying with men. But if women are praying on their own and not with men, \r\n    then they are like men and the best rows are those at the front and the \r\n    worst are those at the back. What is meant by the worst rows for both men \r\n    and women is that they bring less reward, are lower in status and are \r\n    further removed from what is required by sharee&rsquo;ah. And the best rows are \r\n    the opposite of that. The virtue of the last row for women who are praying \r\n    with men is that they are farther away from mixing with men or seeing them \r\n    or becoming attracted to them when seeing their movements or hearing their \r\n    words and so on.

With regard to the issue of reciting Qunoot \r\n    in Fajr and Witr, the issue of whether the Basmalah should be spoken out \r\n    loud, and the issue of the words used to seek refuge with Allaah and so on \r\n    ... They are agreed that if a person says the Basmalah out loud, his prayer \r\n    is valid, and if a person says it silently his prayer is also valid; and \r\n    that if a person recites Qunoot in Fajr his prayer is valid and if he does \r\n    not recite it his prayer is valid, and the same applies to Witr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said (23\/115):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From what we have mentioned it is clear that Qunoot is to be \r\n    recited at times of calamity&hellip; whoever says that it is an essential part of \r\n    prayer which may be made up for with the prostration of forgetfulness is \r\n    basing that on the idea that it is a sunnah which is to be done all the \r\n    time, like the first tashahhud and so on. But it is clear that this is not \r\n    the case; it is not a Sunnah that is to be done regularly, and no \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness is required if it is omitted. If some believe \r\n    that it is a regular Sunnah based on their own ijtihaad this is fine, as in \r\n    the case of all other issues of ijtihaad. Hence the person who is praying \r\n    behind an imam should follow his imam in issues where there is room for \r\n    ijtihaad.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The imam has been appointed to be \r\n    followed.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Do not differ from your imams.&rdquo; And it is proven in\r\n    <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> that he said: &ldquo;They lead you in prayer; if they get it \r\n    right (the reward) is for you and for them, and if they get it wrong, (the \r\n    reward) is for you and (the sin) is on them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: We have an imam who recites Qunoot in Fajr prayer all the time; \r\n    should we follow him?

Always reciting Qunoot in the last rak&rsquo;ah of Fajr prayer, as some of \r\n    the Maalikis and Shaafa&rsquo;is do, is contrary to the Sunnah because there is no \r\n    proof that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did \r\n    that. Rather he used to recite Qunoot at times of calamity, and he used to \r\n    recite Qunoot in Witr prayer. If the imam holds his arms at his side when \r\n    praying and always recites Qunoot in Fajr prayer, as mentioned in the \r\n    question, then knowledgeable people should advise him and remind him to \r\n    follow the Sunnah.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a man to spit in the direction of \r\n    the qiblah whilst praying, and he forbade him to lead his people in prayer, \r\n    and he said to him: &ldquo;You have offended Allaah and His Messenger.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by Abu Dawood, 481 and classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaan in <i>Saheeh \r\n    Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i>.

They \r\n    said that moving from one imam to another is something that is proven in the Sunnah, as in the case of Abu Bakr and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), when Abu Bakr led the people in prayer when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \r\n    ill, then the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out during the prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him, he stepped back to let \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) come forward, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    completed the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 687; Muslim 418. In this story two transfers took place:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Abu Bakr moved from being the imam to \r\n    following another imam<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The Sahaabah moved from following Abu \r\n    Bakr to following the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it was said that this is not permissible, \r\n    because this involves moving from one imam to another, and moving from following an imam to leading the prayer with no excuse, and it is not \r\n    possible to move from a lower position to a higher one, because the person who is leading the prayer is in a higher position than the one who is \r\n    following the imam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They said: And this was not known at the time \r\n    of the salaf. The Sahaabah, if they missed a part of the prayer, they did not agree that one of them would step forward and act as an imam for the \r\n    others. If this was something good they would have done it before us.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But those who say that it is permissible do not say that it is required of those who come late \r\n    to the prayer to agree that one of them will be the imam. Rather they say that if this is done, it is permissible. There is a difference between \r\n    saying that it is permissible and saying that it is mustahabb and prescribed in Islam. We do not say that it is prescribed and we do not recommend \r\n    that if people come late to the prayer, one of them should say, &ldquo;I will be your imam.&rdquo; But if they do that, then we do not say, &ldquo;Your prayer is \r\n    invalid.&rdquo; This is the more correct opinion, i.e., that it is permissible, but we should not do it, because it was not known among the salaf, and \r\n    if something was not known among the salaf, it is better not to do it, because we know that they more keen than us to do what is good, and if \r\n    something were good they would have done it before us.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    2\/316, 317&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5580","question_id":"5580","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      In the answer to question no.\r\n      [fatin]50536[\\fatin] we have stated that the \r\n      scholars differed concerning leading of the prayers by one whose \r\n      pronunciation is defective (i.e., he substitutes some letters for others). \r\n      The correct view is that his leading the prayers is valid, but it is \r\n      better for the prayers to be led by one who recites correctly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If an illiterate person who does not know al-Faatihah leads \r\n    another illiterate person like him in prayer (illiterate here means one who \r\n    does not know how to recite al-Faatihah properly), then his prayer is valid \r\n    because they are equal in their shortcoming.

Some of the scholars are of the view that this \r\n    is valid in naafil prayers, but the correct view is that it is valid in both \r\n    naafil (supererogatory) and fard (obligatory) prayers, because the basic \r\n    principle is that the rulings on both are the same, except in cases where \r\n    there is specific evidence.

When Makkah \r\n    was conquered, then every tribe hastened to embrace Islam, and my father \r\n    urged our tribe to hasten to embrace Islam. When my father returned (from \r\n    the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &lsquo;By Allah, I have come to you from the \r\n    true Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)!&rsquo; The Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) afterwards said to them, \r\n    &lsquo;Offer such-and-such a prayer at such-and-such a time, and when the time for \r\n    the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhaan (for the \r\n    prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows most Qur&rsquo;aan lead the \r\n    prayer.&rsquo; So they looked for such a person and found none who knew more \r\n    Qur'an than I, because of what I used to learn from the people. So they made \r\n    me their imam (to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or \r\n    seven years.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4051)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We say that it is essential for the imam to know the rulings \r\n    on prayer, because he may do something, such as not breaking his wudoo&rsquo;, or \r\n    missing out a rak&rsquo;ah, and not know what to do about it, in which case he \r\n    would make a mistake and cause the prayer of others to be imperfect or \r\n    invalid altogether.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the hadeeth quoted above, some of the scholars said \r\n    that the one who has more knowledge of fiqh should lead the prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and their companions said that the one \r\n    who has more knowledge of fiqh should take precedence over the one who knows \r\n    more Qur&rsquo;aan, because what he needs of recitation is known but what he needs \r\n    of fiqh may not be clear. There may arise during the prayer some matter \r\n    where only a person who has complete knowledge of fiqh will be able to know \r\n    the right thing to do. They said that this is the reason why the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Abu Bakr (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) to lead the prayer rather than anyone else, even though \r\n    he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had stated that others \r\n    had more knowledge of Qur&rsquo;aan than him. But some refuted this point by \r\n    quoting the hadeeth that said that the Sahaabah who had most knowledge of \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan were also those who had most knowledge of fiqh. But there is another \r\n    hadeeth according to which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;If they are equal in knowledge of Qur&rsquo;aan, then the one \r\n    who has most knowledge of the Sunnah,&rdquo; which indicates that those who have \r\n    most knowledge of Qur&rsquo;aan should be given precedence in all cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i>, 5\/177&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even though al-Nawawi differed with his imam al-Shaafa&rsquo;i with \r\n    regard to the interpretation of the hadeeth, their words illustrate the \r\n    basic principle that there was no one among the Sahaabah who had a good \r\n    knowledge of the Qur&rsquo;aan but was ignorant of the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah, as is \r\n    the case among many people nowadays.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If one of them has more knowledge of the rulings on prayer, \r\n    and the other has more knowledge of matters other than prayer, then the one \r\n    who has more knowledge about prayer should be given precedence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/19&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this is understood, then it is not permissible for one who \r\n    is ignorant to lead the prayer unless he is leading others like him, if \r\n    there is no one who is better qualified to lead the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, 1\/264&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not understand what is meant in the question.

The imam of \r\n    the mosque is the one who is responsible for the mosque; his role is not \r\n    restricted only to leading the prayers, because the imaam in the mosque is \r\n    like the sultan in his sultanate &ndash; unless he cannot the mosque properly or \r\n    he is too busy and cannot take care of all the things he needs to, in which \r\n    case there is no reason why another man should not be appointed to take care \r\n    of mosque administration, so long as that is with the imaam&rsquo;s agreement.

Hence the Sunnah of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) and the way of all the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs and those \r\n    Umawi (Umayyad) and &lsquo;Abbaasi (Abassid) rulers who followed their path was \r\n    that the leader would also be an imam or leader of prayers and of jihad. \r\n    Whenever the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a \r\n    commander in war, he would lead the prayers too, and if he appointed a man \r\n    as a governor over a city &ndash; as when he appointed &lsquo;Ataab ibn Usayd (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) to govern Makkah and &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn Abi&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Aas \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) to govern al-Taa&rsquo;if, and &lsquo;Ali and Mu&rsquo;aadh \r\n    and Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with them) to govern Yemen, and &lsquo;Amr \r\n    ibn Hazm (may Allaah be pleased with him) to govern Najraan &ndash; the person \r\n    whom he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed would \r\n    lead them in prayers and carry out hudood punishments amongst them. This was \r\n    also the practice of the khulafa&rsquo; who came after him and those who succeeded \r\n    them, namely the Umawis and some of the &lsquo;Abbasis, because the most important \r\n    matters of religion are prayer and jihad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the imam&rsquo;s \r\n    role in society, there is no doubt that it is an important role.

The \r\n          evidence for this view is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1 &ndash; The general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The people should be led \r\n          in prayer by the one among them who has most knowlegde of the Book of \r\n          Allaah.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 673).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; The specific meaning of the words of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning oppressive leaders \r\n          who lead the prayer at the wrong time: &ldquo;Pray the prayer on time, then \r\n          if you come to them at the time when they are praying, pray with them, \r\n          and it will be a naafil prayer for you.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 648). \r\n          And al-Bukhaari narrated: &ldquo;If the imaam leads the prayer correctly, \r\n          then he and you will receive the rewards, but if he makes a mistake \r\n          (in the prayer) then you will receive the reward for the prayer and \r\n          the sin (will be his).&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 694).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; The Sahaabah, including Ibn &lsquo;Umar, used to pray behind \r\n          al-Hajjaaj, and Ibn &lsquo;Umar was one of the keenest of people to follow \r\n          the Sunnah and pay attention to it, and al-Hajjaaj was known to be one \r\n          of the most rebellious and sinful of the slaves of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          It might also be said that everyone whose prayer is valid, \r\n          it is also valid for him to lead the prayer. There is no evidence to \r\n          suggest that we should differentiate between the validity of the prayer \r\n          and the validity of leading the prayer, because if a person commits \r\n          a sin, he does so for himself, but this is merely theoretical. See <i>al-Sharh \r\n          al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> by Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, 4\/304).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          You should note that the reward for leading the prayers \r\n          is very great and it is a great honour. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the one who has \r\n          more knowledge of Qur&rsquo;aan (i.e., the one who has memorized more) is \r\n          the one who should be given precedence in leading the prayer. (See Question \r\n          no. 1875) Therefore if someone else knows \r\n          more Qur&rsquo;aan than you do, he should be given precedence. If there is \r\n          no one other than yourself, then it is o.k. for you to lead the others \r\n          in prayer, even if you are a sinner for the reasons explained above. \r\n          &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Finally, we advise you to fear Allaah and to avoid waging \r\n          war against Him by sinning.

This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam \r\nrecited a verse that contains the word of prostration (<i>sajdah<\/i>) and the people \r\nmisunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when \r\nthe Imam says <i>takbeer<\/i> for <i>ruku<\/i>&lsquo; at the end of the verse and performs <i>ruku<\/i>&lsquo;, some of \r\nthe followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the <i>takbeer<\/i> for \r\nthe prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from \r\nthe <i>ruku<\/i>&lsquo; saying &ldquo;<i>sami&lsquo;a Allahu li man hamidah<\/i>&rdquo;, they return back (stand up) from \r\ntheir prostration. Thus, they missed the act of <i>ruku<\/i>&lsquo; and standing up from it. So it is \r\nincumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. \r\nThis is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally \r\nlags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long \r\nsupplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the \r\nmajority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive \r\nobligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful.<sup>1<\/sup> However, in \r\nprinciple the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace be upon \r\nhim):<\/p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<li>The Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him.

He will be a point of reference and a leader for the people of the mosque. If the people know that he will be coming back again, this will encourage them to discuss issues and problems with him.&nbsp;<br>\r\n      (ii)\tPeople will be able to listen to useful things that need to be spoken about in a series of khutbahs, e.g., the tafseer of Soorat al-Faatihah, or the Signs of the Hour, or the battles (of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), or teaching the salaah (prayer). Such series can usually only be done by one imaam, which is not the case when the khateeb is different each week.&nbsp;<br>\r\n      (iii)\tThe people will be able to listen to something new each week, because a regular khateeb will not repeat the same topics too soon, lest he bore the people. He will come up with something new each week, unlike what happens with different imaams who tell the people similar things time and time again, which wastes time that otherwise could be put to good use.<br>\r\n      (iv)\tIf the khateeb is also the imaam, this is better, because he will know all the matters and problems concerning the people of the mosque. Things may happen during the week to the people of the neighbourhood or those who attend the mosque, which requires the comments of the imaam, or he may refer to them in the Jumu'ah khutbah.<br>\r\n      (v)\tThis is also in accordance with the teaching of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the khaleefahs who succeeded him, where the imaam and regular khateeb were one and the same.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n      2.\tYou must be very careful to make sure that the imaam is one of the Ahl al-Sunnah and that he follows their 'aqeedah. This is what will benefit you in your religion; anyone else who is a follower of bid'ah will only cause you harm and lead you astray.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n      3.\tIn addition to his having a sound 'aqeedah, he must also be knowledgeable, so that you will hear something useful in his lessons and khutbahs.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n      4.\tThere is no reason why you should not form a committee, including some knowledgeable brothers, to choose an imaam and khateeb, because people's emotions may prevent them from distinguishing between what is beneficial and what is harmful (i.e., they may not make the right choice of imaam).&nbsp;<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n      5.\tIt is not essential for the person to be able to be both imaam and khateeb. Many famous qaari's (readers of Qur'aan) know nothing about the rulings of sharee'ah, and many eloquent khateebs are unsure of the rulings on sujood al-sahw (prostration of forgetfulness), and many knowledgeable people cannot give khutbahs and address the people.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n      If it is necessary to have an imaam who is different from the khateeb, there is nothing wrong with that. If the circumstances of the community do not permit one person to be a full-time imaam and khateeb because of study and work commitments, then it is OK to appoint a group of people who are qualified to act as imaams and khateebs, and to draw up a roster so that the mosque will be able to fulfil its responsibilities and not falter in its work.

So they combined knowledge and action [they acted upon what they had\r\n    learned], and did not stop at merely memorizing as is the case nowadays. How many people\r\n    learn all or part of the Qur&#146;aan, take care to recite it properly and with a\r\n    beautiful voice, but they do not know anything about the fiqh of salaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Qur&#146;aan, then\r\n    the one who knows more about the Sunnah should lead the prayer. If they are equal with\r\n    regard to knowledge of the Sunnah, then the one who made hijrah first should lead the\r\n    prayer. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, or if this does not apply, then the one\r\n    who is older should lead the prayer, as is indicated in the hadeeth of Maalik ibn\r\n    al-Huwayrith, who said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>We came to the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),\r\n    and we were young people, close in age. We stayed with him for twenty days, and the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was kind to us. When he\r\n    thought that we were missing our families, he asked us about those whom we had left\r\n    behind, and we told him. He said, &#147;Go back to your families and stay with them. Teach\r\n    them and instruct them&#148; &#150; and he said some things I remembered and some that I\r\n    forgot. &#147;And pray as you have seen me praying. When the time for prayer comes, let\r\n    one of you call the Adhaan and let the oldest among you lead the prayer.&#148; (Narrated\r\n    by al-Bukhaari, no. 6705). If they are equal with regard to recitation of\r\n    the Qur&#146;aan, knowledge and hijrah, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) commanded that the eldest of them should be appointed to lead the prayer. If\r\n    they are equal in age, then the one who is most righteous (has most taqwaa) should be\r\n    appointed, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that\r\n    (believer) who has al-Taqwaa (is one of the pious)&#133;&#148; [al-Hujuraat 49:13]<\/i>.

Did they say Qunoot? He said: That is an innovation. Al-Tirmidhi \r\n    said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth, and should be followed according to \r\n    most of the scholars. Ibraaheem al-Nakha&rsquo;i said: The first one who said \r\n    Qunoot in Fajr prayer was &lsquo;Ali, because he was a man at war who prayed \r\n    against his enemies. Sa&rsquo;eed narrated in his <i>Sunan<\/i> from Hushaym, from \r\n    &lsquo;Urwah al-Hamadhaani, that al-Shu&rsquo;bi said: When &lsquo;Ali said Qunoot in Fajr \r\n    prayer, the people objected. &lsquo;Ali said: We are only asking Allaah for \r\n    support against our enemies.

Narrated by \r\n    Sa&rsquo;eed. The hadeeth of Anas may be understood as meaning that he stood for a \r\n    long time, because that may be called Qunoot. And the Qunoot of &lsquo;Umar may be \r\n    understood as having happened at times of calamity, because most of the \r\n    reports from him indicate that he did not say Qunoot, but a number of people \r\n    narrated that from him, which indicates that his Qunoot was only in times of \r\n    calamity.

So if the aim in going to hear the voice \r\n    of one imam or another is the desire to seek good and to perfect one&rsquo;s focus \r\n    in prayer, then there is nothing wrong with that; rather it is to be \r\n    appreciated, and he will be rewarded according to his intention. A person \r\n    may attain khushoo&rsquo; behind one imam and not behind another, because of the \r\n    difference between the two recitations and the two prayers. So if the \r\n    intention behind going to a distant mosque is to listen to the imam&rsquo;s \r\n    recitation because of his beautiful voice, and to benefit from them, and so \r\n    that he will focus properly in his prayer, and not just because of whims and \r\n    desires or for a change of scene, rather it is for the purpose of benefit \r\n    and knowledge, and seeking to attain khushoo&rsquo; in prayer, then there is \r\n    nothing wrong with that. It is proven in the saheeh hadeeth that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The people who will \r\n    receive the greatest reward for prayer is those who walk the furthest [to \r\n    the mosque], then those who walk the next furthest.&rdquo; So if his intention is \r\n    also to increase the number of steps he takes, that is also a good aim.

With regard to one who is following an imaam \r\n    reciting al-Faatihah behind the imaam in a prayer where Qur&#8217;aan is to be \r\n    recited out loud, there are two scholarly opinions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The first \r\n    opinion is that it is obligatory, the evidence for that being the general \r\n    meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him): &#8220;There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening \r\n    of the Book [i.e., al-Faatihah].&#8221; And because when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught the one who had not prayed \r\n    properly, he told him to recite al-Faatihah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was \r\n    narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to recite it in every rak&#8217;ah. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar \r\n    said in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>: &#8220;It was proven that permission was given to \r\n    the one who is praying behind an imaam to recite al-Faatihah in prayers in \r\n    which Qur&#8217;aan is to be recited out loud, without any exceptions. That is \r\n    what was narrated by al-Bukhaari in <i>Juz&#8217; al-Qiraa&#8217;ah<\/i>, and by al-Tirmidhi, \r\n    Ibn Hibbaan and others, from Makhool from Mahmood ibn al-Rabee&#8217; from \r\n    &#8216;Ubaadah, that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    stumbled in his recitation in Fajr, and when he finished he said, &#8220;Perhaps \r\n    you recite behind your imaam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do not do that, \r\n    except for the Opening of the Book (al-Faaithah), for there is no prayer for \r\n    the one who does not recite it.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second \r\n    opinion is that the recitation of the imaam is also the recitation of the \r\n    one who is praying behind him. The evidence for that is the aayah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&#8220;So, when \r\n    the Qur&#8217;aan is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive \r\n    mercy&#8221; [al-A&#8217;raaf 7:204]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Hajar said: &#8220;Those \r\n    who say that (the one who is praying behind an imaam) does not have to \r\n    recite it in prayers where Qur&#8217;aan is to be recited out loud, such as the \r\n    Maalikis, quote as evidence the hadeeth, &#8216;When he recites then listen \r\n    attentively.&#8217; This is a saheeh hadeeth which was narrated by Muslim from Abu \r\n    Moosa al-&#8216;Ash&#8217;ari.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Those who \r\n    say that it is obligatory say that it should be recited after the imaam has \r\n    finished reciting al-Faatihah and before he starts to recite another soorah, \r\n    or that it should be recited when the imam pauses. Ibn Hajar said: &#8220;He \r\n    should listen when the imam is reciting, and recite it when he is silent.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Baaz said, &#8220;What is meant by when the imam pauses is when he pauses during \r\n    al-Faatihah or after reciting it, or in the soorah that he recites after it. \r\n    If the imam does not pause, then the one who is praying behind him has to \r\n    recite al-Faatihah even if the imam is reciting, according to the more \r\n    correct of the two scholarly opinions.&#8221; (See <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    vol. 11, p. 221)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Standing \r\n    Committee was asked a similar question and replied as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The correct \r\n    scholarly opinion is that it is obligatory to recite al-Faatihah when \r\n    praying alone and it is obligatory upon the imam and those whom he is \r\n    leading both in prayers where Qur&#8217;aan is to be recited out loud and when it \r\n    is to be recited silently, because of the soundness and specific nature of \r\n    the texts which indicate that. The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&#8220;So, when \r\n    the Qur&#8217;aan is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive \r\n    mercy&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-A&#8217;raaf \r\n    7:204]<\/i> is general in meaning. The hadeeth, &#8220;When \r\n    the Qur&#8217;aan is recited then listen attentively&#8221; is general and applies both \r\n    to al-Faatihah and other soorahs. These two texts are general in meaning, \r\n    and the following hadeeth refer to an exception to that rule:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#8220;There is no \r\n    prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book.&#8221; Thus we may \r\n    reconcile all the proven evidence. The hadeeth &#8220;The recitation of the imaam \r\n    is the recitation of the one who is praying behind him&#8221; is da&#8217;eef (weak). It \r\n    is not correct to say that the Ameen of the congregation to the imaam&#8217;s \r\n    recitation of al-Faatihah takes the place of their own recitation. The \r\n    differences of opinion among the scholars concerning this matter should not \r\n    be taken as a means to hate one another, and to divide and turn our backs on \r\n    one another. Rather you have to study the matter in more detail and find out \r\n    more. If one of you is following a scholar who says that the one who is \r\n    praying behind an imam has to recite al-Faatihah during prayers in which \r\n    Qur&#8217;aan is to be recited out loud, and others are following a scholar who \r\n    says that they must be silent and listen to the imam in prayers where \r\n    Qur&#8217;aan is to be recited out loud, and that the imam&#8217;s recitation of al-Faatihah \r\n    is sufficient, there is nothing wrong with that. There is no need for one \r\n    group to denounce the other, or to hate one another because of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They have to be open-minded about differences \r\n    of opinion among the scholars, and about the reasons for that, and ask \r\n    Allaah to guide them in matters concerning which there are differences of \r\n    opinion as to what is correct, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive. \r\n    May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.<br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"5650","question_id":"5650","answers":"<p>If the Imam recited a part of the Qur&rsquo;an and forgot the ending of the \r\nverse, and none of the followers reminded him of it, he can choose \r\neither to say the <i>takbeer<\/i> and discontinue the recitation, or recite a \r\nverse or more from another <i>surah<\/i>.

The evidence for this is that the\r\n    texts instruct this particular wording, which is Arabic, and that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do it any other way.<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if a non-Arab cannot speak Arabic and is unable to\r\n    pronounce it, then according to the majority of fuqaha&rsquo; it is OK for him to say the\r\n    Takbeer in his own language after it has been translated from Arabic, according to the\r\n    statements of the Shaafa&rsquo;is and Hanbalis, no matter what the language is. The Takbeer\r\n    is remembrance or mentioning of Allaah, and Allaah can be remembered or mentioned in every\r\n    language, so a language other than Arabic is an alternative, and the person has to learn\r\n    how to say it in the other language. There is some controversy as to whether all of the\r\n    adhkaar of the prayer, such as tashahhud, qunoot, du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and the tasbeehaat in\r\n    rukoo&rsquo; and sujood may be said in languages other than Arabic.<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to reading Qur&rsquo;aan, the majority say that it\r\n    is not permissible to read it in any language other than Arabic. The evidence for this is\r\n    the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic\r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan&hellip;&rdquo; [Yoosuf 12:2]<\/p>\r\n    <\/i><p>Moreover, the Qur&rsquo;aan is a miracle in its wording\r\n    and its meaning; if it is changed, this is no longer the case, and it is no longer\r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan but an interpretation (tafseer).

It is only an interpretation (tafseer), and if the\r\n    interpretation were like the Qur&rsquo;aan itself, they would not be unable to meet the\r\n    challenge of producing a soorah like it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person cannot read well in Arabic, he has to learn. If\r\n    he does not learn when he is able to, his prayers are not valid. If he is not able, or he\r\n    fears that he does not have time to learn before the time for the next prayer is over, and\r\n    he knows one aayah of al-Faatihah, he should repeat it seven times&hellip; If he can recite\r\n    more than that, he should repeat it as much as he needs to make his recitation equivalent\r\n    to the length of Soorat al-Fatihah, or he could make it up by reciting other aayaat. If he\r\n    knows some aayaat he does not have to repeat, he could recite another aayah instead,\r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the one who\r\n    could not recite Qur&rsquo;aan well to say &lsquo;Al-Hamdu Lillaah (Praise be to\r\n    Allaah)&rsquo; and other phrases, which is part of an aayah, but he did not command him to\r\n    repeat it. If he cannot do anything, but he knows some of the Qur&rsquo;aan by heart, he\r\n    should recite whatever he can, and nothing else will do, because of the report narrated by\r\n    Abu Dawood from Rifaa&rsquo;ah ibn Raafi&rsquo;, who said that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When you get up to pray, if you know some\r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan, recite it, otherwise say <i>al-hamdu Lillaah<\/i> (praise be to Allaah), and <i>La\r\n    ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i> (there is no god but Allaah), and <i>Allaahu akbar<\/i> (Allaah is\r\n    Most Great).&rdquo; This is more like Qur&rsquo;aan, and is more appropriate (than any other\r\n    words). He should also recite as much as he needs to make it equivalent in length to\r\n    Soorat al-Faatihah.

What is prescribed is for the Imam to remain quiet briefly between al-Faatihah and the soorah that comes after it so as to distinguish between the obligatory recitation and the mustahabb recitation. During this silent pause it is prescribed for the one who is praying behind the Imam to recite al-Faatihah and complete the recitation, even if the imam recited it. But as for the imam falling silent for a long time, this is contrary to the Sunnah.

I offer you my condolences for your\r\n      great loss if you have caught up with nothing of the prayer except the\r\n      tashahhud.

This condition is based on the famous hadeeth about the one who\r\n      did not pray properly. But if it is only the case of the imam reciting\r\n      relatively fast and he is able to maintain the required measured pace, in\r\n      this case it is usually possible to recite Soorat al-Faatihah behind him,\r\n      and if you can recite it faster, there is nothing wrong with that. But if\r\n      you are not reciting al-Faatihah for another reason, such as laziness or\r\n      forgetfulness, or because you joined the prayer late, then this does not\r\n      affect your prayer, which is still valid, and the imaam&rsquo;s recitation\r\n      counts as your recitation.<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>The Muslim must hasten to prayer as soon as the\r\n      call is given. This is one of the attributes of the believers whose hearts\r\n      are attached to the mosques. Being late and only coming when the iqaamah\r\n      has been given is a sign of weak faith and little desire to do good and be\r\n      obedient. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n      would be attending to his family&rsquo;s needs, then when Bilaal gave the call\r\n      to prayer, he would stop what he was doing and rush to pray.

But those who are lazy and do not come to the mosque until the\r\n      iqaamah has been given or during the prayer or during the tashahhud should\r\n      check and rebuke themselves, for the believer&rsquo;s deeds will say to him in\r\n      his grave: &ldquo;By Allaah, I only saw you quick to obey Allaah and slow to\r\n      disobey Him.&rdquo; But in the case of the munaafiq (hypocrite) and faasiq\r\n      (evildoer), his deeds will say: &ldquo;By Allaah, I only saw you slow to obey\r\n      Allaah and quick to disobey Him.&rdquo; (This is a hadeeth narrated by Imaam\r\n      Ahmad. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Ahkaam al-Janaa&rsquo;iz<\/i>,\r\n      where he also mentioned its isnaads).<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Allaah described the munaafiqeen (hypocrites) as\r\n      follows (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And when they stand up for\r\n      al-salaah (the prayer), they stand with laziness&rdquo; [al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:142].<\/i>\r\n      So let people pay attention to the seriousness of this matter, and let\r\n      Muslim women too beware of delaying the prayer until the last moments and\r\n      beware of letting worldly concerns distract them from paying attention to\r\n      the provision of the Hereafter&hellip; Whoever gets used to praying regularly\r\n      on time with the jamaa&rsquo;ah in the mosque when the call (adhaan) is given\r\n      will find that this becomes his main concern and will no longer neglect\r\n      it, in sha Allaah. Whoever tries this will find deep joy, tranquillity and\r\n      peace of heart and mind in the prayer. This will enable him to attain the\r\n      proper sense of humility (khushoo&rsquo;) when he stands before Allaah. One of\r\n      the favours of Allaah to people is when a year goes by and a person never\r\n      misses a single fard prayer with the jamaa&rsquo;ah, except for a valid\r\n      excuse. The sincere believer gets very upset if one day he sleeps and\r\n      misses the prayer, or is late for the prayer because of some worldly\r\n      matter, and all of the matters of this world are insignificant and\r\n      fleeting.

This is the\r\n    Maaliki view.&#148; And Ibn Qudaamah said: &#147;If there is a barrier between the imaam\r\n    and the person who is following him, which prevents him from seeing the imaam or the\r\n    people praying behind him, then there are two views narrated from Ahmad, one of which says\r\n    that it is not valid for him to pray behind him&#133; and the second view is: it is valid\r\n    because he can follow the imaam without seeing him, as a blind person does. But for his\r\n    following the imaam to be valid, he has to be able to hear him.&#148; (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>,\r\n    2\/208)<\/p>\r\n    <p>In conclusion, if you are inside the mosque and you can hear the\r\n    imaam&#146;s voice and you know where he is in the prayer, then follow him, otherwise pray\r\n    by yourself or with a group of women after the imaam finishes the prayer. <\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard\r\n    to whether your prayer is valid or not, we asked Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih\r\n    al-&#145;Uthaymeen, and he replied that to be on the safe side you should repeat the\r\n    prayer.

This is a great blessing for which Allaah should be praised and thanked.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Muslim has to understand that prayer is \r\n    the greatest of the pillars of Islam, and that it is the thing which distinguishes a Muslim from a kaafir, as it says in the hadeeth of Jaabir \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;Between a man \r\n    and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by Muslim, 82.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fuqaha&rsquo; (may Allaah have mercy on them) \r\n    differed concerning the ruling on congregational prayers. There are a number of opinions, the most sound of which is that prayer in congregation \r\n    in the mosque is obligatory and is what is indicated by the shar&rsquo;i evidence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the view of &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; ibn Abi Rabaah, \r\n    al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and Abi Thawr, and of Imam Ahmad as it appears from some of his statements. This was also stated by al-Shaafa&rsquo;i in\r\n    <i>Mukhtasar al-Muzni<\/i> where he said: &ldquo;With regard to praying in congregation, I do not allow a concession to anyone not to do it except one \r\n    who has an excuse.&rdquo; This was also the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the evidence that it is \r\n    obligatory, it is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among \r\n    them, and lead them in As-Salaah (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they \r\n    finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray \r\n    with you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:102]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Mundhir said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fact that Allaah has commanded us to \r\n    establish prayer in congregation even at times of fear indicates that doing so at times of security is even more obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Awsat<\/i>, 4\/135&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are several ways in which this verse \r\n    may be taken as evidence:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly, Allaah commands them to pray in \r\n    congregation, then He repeats the command with regard to the second group, by saying &ldquo;<i>and let the other party come up \r\n    which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you<\/i>&rdquo;. This indicates that praying in congregation is obligatory on an \r\n    individual basis, as Allaah did not excuse the second group because the first group had done it. If praying in congregation was Sunnah, the best \r\n    excuse for not doing it would be the excuse of fear. If it were fard kafaayah (a communal obligation), it would no longer be obligatory after the \r\n    first group had done it. So this verse proves that it is obligatory for each and every individual. So these are the three ways in which this verse \r\n    proves it is obligatory: Allaah commands it once, then He commands it again, and He does not allow them a concession not to do it at times of \r\n    fear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Salaah wa Hukm Taarikiha<\/i>, \r\n    p. 137, 138&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And perform As-Salaah \r\n    (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allaah) along with Ar-Raaki&lsquo;oon (those who bow)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:43]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The way in which this verse may be taken as \r\n    evidence is that here Allaah commanded them to bow, which refers to prayer. Prayer is described as rukoo&rsquo; (bowing) here because bowing is one of \r\n    the pillars or essential parts of the prayer, and prayer is sometimes referred to by its pillars and obligatory components, as Allaah calls it <i>\r\n    sujood<\/i> (prostration), Qur&rsquo;aan and <i>Tasbeeh<\/i> (glorification of Allaah). And the phrase &ldquo;<i>along with Ar-Raaki&lsquo;oon \r\n    (those who bow)<\/i>&rdquo; cannot mean anything other than doing it with a congregation of worshippers. This is what the word <i>\r\n    ma&rsquo;a<\/i> (with) means. Once this is understood, if a command mentions a particular manner or situation, then the one who is commanded to do it \r\n    cannot obey the command properly unless he does it in the manner or situation mentioned. Some may argue that Allaah says&nbsp; (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O Maryam! Submit yourself with obedience \r\n    to your Lord (Allaah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raaki&lsquo;oon (those who bow down)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:43]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>but this does not mean that women have to \r\n    attend prayers in congregation. It was said that this verse does not imply that this is enjoined upon all women, rather this was something that \r\n    applied only to Maryam, unlike the words &ldquo;<i>And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, and bow down (or \r\n    submit yourselves with obedience to Allaah) along with Ar-Raaki&lsquo;oon (those who bow)<\/i>&rdquo;. Maryam was a unique case, unlike \r\n    other women, because her mother had vowed that she would be sacred to Allaah and devoted to His worship; she would stay in the place of worship \r\n    and not leave it. So she was commanded to bow with the people in the place of worship. When Allaah chose her and purified her and chose her above \r\n    all the women of the world, He commanded her to obey Him in ways that were unique to her and did not apply to other women. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And (remember) when the angels said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allaah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the &lsquo;<span>Aalameen<\/span> \r\n    (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime).&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>43.&nbsp;O Mary! &ldquo;Submit \r\n    yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allaah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raaki&lsquo;oon \r\n    (those who bow down)&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:42-43]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some say that the fact that they were \r\n    commanded to bow with those who bow does not indicate that it is obligatory to bow with them at the time when they are bowing, rather it indicates \r\n    that one should do as they do, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Fear Allaah, and be \r\n    with those who are true (in words and deeds)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Tawbah 9:119]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They further argue that the word <i>ma&rsquo;a<\/i> \r\n    (with) means doing the same as they do, but it does not necessarily mean doing it at the same time. The answer is that in Arabic, the word ma&rsquo;a \r\n    means more than doing the same as someone else, rather it means doing it with them, especially in the case of prayer. If someone says &ldquo;Go and pray \r\n    with the congregation&rdquo; or &ldquo;I prayed with the congregation&rdquo;, the only interpretation can be is that he went and joined them and prayed together \r\n    with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>al-Salaah wa Hukm Taarikiha<\/i>, \r\n    139-141&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;By the One in Whose hand is my \r\n    soul, I was thinking of ordering that wood be gathered, then I would have ordered that the call to prayer be given, then I would have told a man \r\n    to lead the people in prayer, then I would have gone from behind and burned the houses of men who did not attend the (congregational) prayer down \r\n    around them. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of them had known that he would get a bone covered with good meat or two sheep&rsquo;s feet \r\n    with meat in them, he would have turned up for the &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 618; Muslim, 651&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The most burdensome prayers for the hypocrites are &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; and Fajr.&nbsp; \r\n    If they knew what (reward) is in them, they would come to them even if they had to crawl.

But when he turned away he said, &ldquo;Can you hear the call to prayer?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He \r\n    said, &ldquo;Then answer it.&rdquo; According to a version narrated by Abu Dawood (552) and Ibn Maajah (792) he said: &ldquo;I do not think there is any concession \r\n    for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said concerning this hadeeth: its \r\n    isnaad is saheeh or hasan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    4\/164&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Mundhir said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If there is no concession for a blind man, \r\n    then it is more appropriate that there should be no concession for one who can see.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Awsat<\/i>, 4\/134<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If there is no concession for a blind man who \r\n    had no one to lead him, it is more appropriate that there should be no concession for others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/3<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;5 &ndash; It was narrated that Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: Whoever would like to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him regularly perform these prayers when the call \r\n    for them is given, for they are among the ways of guidance. Allaah has prescribed for your Prophet ways of guidance, and if you pray in your \r\n    homes, as this one who stays away from the prayers prays in his home, then you will have abandoned the way of your Prophet, and if you abandon the \r\n    way of your Prophet you will go astray. There is no man who purifies himself and does it well, then he goes to one of these mosques, but for every \r\n    step he takes, Allaah will record for him one hasanah (good deed) and will raise him thereby one degree in status, and will erase for him one \r\n    sayi&rsquo;ah (bad deed). I saw us (at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) and no one stayed behind from these \r\n    prayers except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy. A man would come supported by two others so that he could stand in the row.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>According to another version, he said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us the ways of guidance, and told us that one of the way of guidance \r\n    is to pray in the mosque when the call to prayer is given.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by Muslim, 654&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What we may conclude from this is that he \r\n    described staying away from the prayers as one of the signs of the hypocrites who are known for their hypocrisy. The signs of hypocrisy are not \r\n    omitting mustahabb actions or doing makrooh things. Whoever seeks to learn the signs of hypocrisy according to the Sunnah will find that they are \r\n    omitting obligatory actions or doing haraam things. This is supported by the fact that he said: &ldquo;Whoever would like to meet Allaah tomorrow as a \r\n    Muslim, let him regularly perform these prayers when the call for them is given&rdquo;. And he described the one who stays away and offers the prayers \r\n    at home as being one who has abandoned the Sunnah which is the path of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    and the laws that he prescribed for his ummah. What is meant is not the Sunnah which those who wish can do and those who do not wish can omit, \r\n    because omitting that is not misguidance or a sign of hypocrisy &ndash; such as not praying Duha and qiyaam al-layl, or fasting on Mondays and \r\n    Thursdays.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Salaah wa Hukm Taarikiha<\/i>, \r\n    p. 146, 147&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; The consensus of the Sahaabah&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There was consensus among the Sahaabah and we \r\n    will quote what they said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We have mentioned the words of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood \r\n    above: &ldquo;I saw us (at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) and no one stayed behind from these prayers except \r\n    a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was also narrated that Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Whoever hears the muezzin and does not respond with no excuse, his prayer is not valid.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash&rsquo;ari \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever hears the muezzin and does not respond with no excuse, his prayer is not valid.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that &lsquo;Ali said: &ldquo;There is no \r\n    prayer for a neighbour of the mosque except in the mosque.&rdquo; It was said, &ldquo;Who is the neighbour of the mosque?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Whoever can hear the \r\n    muezzin.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that al-Hasan ibn &lsquo;Ali (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not come, his prayer does not go beyond his head, except for one who \r\n    has an excuse.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Whoever among the neighbours of the mosque hears the call to prayer, and he is in good health and does not have any \r\n    excuse, his prayer is not valid.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Salaah wa Hukm Taarikiha<\/i>, \r\n    p\/ 153&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is a great deal of evidence, but what \r\n    we have quoted above is sufficient.

He granted him \r\n    that concession, then when he turned to leave he called him back and said, &ldquo;Can you hear the call to prayer?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said, &lsquo;Then \r\n    answer it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And there is other evidence too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What is meant by hearing the call to prayer is hearing it with the voice that is \r\n    ordinarily used, without amplification, when other noises are still and there is nothing to prevent hearing the adhaan. It should also be noted \r\n    that the muezzins at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to give the call to prayer from high places, \r\n    such as the roof of the mosque and the like, and the way the houses were built was conducive to the sound reaching far and wide. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on this, a distance of ten minutes on foot is regarded as a distance which \r\n    the sound of the adhaan would ordinarily reach under the conditions described above; indeed it would reach further than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So your husband has to observe this ritual in the mosque so long as it is free \r\n    from anything that is regarded in sharee&rsquo;ah as an impediment.

How much goodness \r\n    there is to be attained by praying in congregation in the mosque, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Prayer \r\n    offered in a group is twenty-five times better than prayer offered at home or in the marketplace. If any one of you does wudoo&rsquo; and does it well, \r\n    then comes to the mosque for no other purpose than to pray, then he does not take a single step but Allaah raises him in status one degree thereby \r\n    and removes one sin from him, until he enters the mosque. Then he is in a state of prayer so long as he is waiting for the prayer, and the angels \r\n    send blessings upon him so long as he remains in the spot where he prayed, saying &lsquo;O Allaah, forgive him, O Allaah, have mercy on him,&rsquo; so long as \r\n    he does not pass wind.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 465; Muslim, 649.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Who among us does not want his status to be raised and his sins erased, and to \r\n    have the angels of the Most Merciful pray for forgiveness for him??&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So your husband should strive to pray in congregation in the mosque and to be with \r\n    the Muslims and show strength of numbers. He should understand that when the Muslims are steadfast in adhering to their religion and keeping its \r\n    rituals and symbols alive, these are some of the most important factors in making them stand firm and prevail over their enemies; indeed this \r\n    steadfastness is a kind of da&rsquo;wah that has an effect on the hearts of others. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The father should also set a good example to his wife and children.

It is not the matter of whether it is obligatory or not, rather it is the matter of strong faith \r\n    that motivates a person to emulate his Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his noble Companions, and wanting nothing less \r\n    than the highest degrees of Paradise. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A Sahaabi would come leaning on two other men because of sickness, so that he could stand in \r\n    the row of worshippers, even though he would be excused if he did not come and pray in congregation.

His faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The one who is keen does not ask whether it is obligatory or not, rather he is keen to follow \r\n    the Sunnah and the way of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Whoever would like to meet Allaah tomorrow \r\n    as a Muslim, let him offer these prayers regularly when the call to prayer is given, for what Allaah has prescribed for your Prophet is guidance \r\n    and this is part of that guidance. If you were to pray in your houses as this man who stayed home did, you would have given up one of the Sunnahs \r\n    of your Prophet, and if you give up a Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. There is no man who does wudoo&rsquo; and does it well, then goes to \r\n    one of these mosques, but for every step he takes Allaah will record one hasanah (good deed) for him, and erase one bad deed. There was a time \r\n    when no one stayed away from the prayer but a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known, and a man would come supported by two others so that he \r\n    could stand in the row.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 654.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What we have mentioned about hearing the call to prayer is what was stated in a fatwa by Shaykh \r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), when he was asked about a man who lives in a house far away from the mosque and has to use \r\n    a car to go to the prayers because if he goes on foot he sometimes misses the prayer, but he can hear the adhaan over the loudspeakers. Is there \r\n    any sin on him if he prays at home with three or four neighbours in the home of one of them?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Shaykh replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You have to pray with your Muslim brothers in the mosque, if you can hear the adhaan in your \r\n    home at a normal volume without the aid of loudspeakers, when other sounds are silent and there is nothing to prevent you from hearing it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If you are far away and cannot hear the adhaan without the loudspeakers, it is permissible for \r\n    you to pray in your house or with some of your neighbours, because it was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said to the blind man when he asked him for permission to pray in his house: &ldquo;Can you hear the call to prayer?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Then \r\n    answer it.&rdquo; Narrated by Imam Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever hears the call \r\n    to prayer and does not come, there is no prayer for him [i.e., his prayer is not valid], except for the one who has an excuse.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn \r\n    Maajah, al-Daaraqutni, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim with a saheeh isnad.

Imam Abu Dawood said: I \r\n    heard Ahmed being asked about a man who catches up with the imam when he is \r\n    bowing; he says takbeer and bows, then the imam stands up.

It was \r\n    also the view of the four imams (Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and \r\n    Ahmad).

The intention to bow does not cancel out the \r\n    intention to start praying. So the pillar or essential part, namely the \r\n    opening takbeer, suffices for the obligatory duty, namely the takbeer for \r\n    bowing, just as tawaaf al-ifaadah suffices for the farewell tawaaf if it is \r\n    done last of all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/183; <i>al-Qawaa&rsquo;id<\/i> by Ibn Rajab, \r\n    number 18.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person can say two \r\n    takbeers, one for starting the prayer and one for bowing, that is better. \r\n    Abu Dawood said: I said to Ahmad: Is saying two takbeers dearer to you? He \r\n    said: If he says two takbeers there is no dispute on the matter.

If he fears \r\n    that he may miss the rak&rsquo;ah, then the opening takbeer will suffice according \r\n    to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because they are two acts \r\n    of worship being combined at the same time and the greater will suffice for \r\n    the lesser.

This is the view of the majority and it is \r\n    the correct view, in sha Allah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu Bakrah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him), when he came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) when he was bowing and he bowed before he reached the row. He \r\n    mentioned that to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) and he said: &ldquo;May Allaah make you more keen, but do not do it again.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 783.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point here is that if catching up with bowing did not \r\n    count as catching up with the rak&rsquo;ah with the imam, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have told him to make up that \r\n    rak&rsquo;ah in which he did not catch up with the recitation, but no such thing \r\n    has been reported from him. This indicates that the one who catches up with \r\n    bowing has caught up with the rak&rsquo;ah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;See <i>Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah<\/i>, p. 230.&nbsp;\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shawkaan said: Similarly the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told the one who joins the prayer to do \r\n    what the imam does, and it is known that this cannot be done unless he bows \r\n    with his imam. If he starts to recite al-Faatihah, he has caught up with the \r\n    imam in a state where he is not doing what his imam does, so he has \r\n    disobeyed the command to follow the imam.

Rather \r\n    he should be denounced and rebuked for his evil actions, and ostracized if \r\n    that will put an end to his evildoing and wrongful actions. As for not \r\n    praying behind him, it is not permissible to stop praying behind him, unless \r\n    there is another imam who is better than him in religious commitment and who \r\n    does not commit wrongdoing or follow his whims and desires.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly with regard to those inhabitants of your village \r\n    who pray behind him, you have to pray with them even if there are evildoers \r\n    and wrongdoers among them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a member of the congregation knows that the imam is an \r\n    innovator who calls others to follow his innovation (bid&rsquo;ah), or is an \r\n    evildoer who commits evil openly, and he is the regular imam and he has no \r\n    choice but to pray behind him, such as the imam for Friday prayers and Eid \r\n    prayers, or the imam who leads the prayers during Hajj in &lsquo;Arafah, and the \r\n    like, then he must pray behind him, according to most of the earlier and \r\n    later scholars. This is the view of Ahmad, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Abu Haneefah and \r\n    others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence they said in <i>al-&lsquo;Aqaa&rsquo;id<\/i>: he should offer Friday \r\n    prayers and Eid prayers behind any imam, whether he is righteous or \r\n    immoral.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Similarly, if there is \r\n    only one imam in the village, then all people should pray behind him, \r\n    because praying in congregation is better than a man praying alone, even if \r\n    the imam is an evildoer. This is the view of most the scholars: Ahmad ibn \r\n    Hanbal, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and others. Indeed, praying in congregation is an \r\n    individual obligation according to the well-known view of Ahmad. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever does not pray Jumu&rsquo;ah or pray in congregation behind \r\n    an immoral imam is an innovator according to Imam Ahmad and other Sunni \r\n    imams.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that he should offer the prayers and not \r\n    repeat them, because the Sahaabah used to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah and prayers in \r\n    congregation behind immoral imams and they did not repeat the prayers. Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Umar used to pray behind al-Hajjaaj, and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and others used to \r\n    pray behind al-Waleed ibn &lsquo;Uqbah, who was a wine-drinker. One day he led \r\n    them in prying Fajr and made it four rak&rsquo;ahs, then he said: &ldquo;Shall I \r\n    increase it for you?&rdquo; and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood said: &ldquo;Things are getting worse.&rdquo; \r\n    Hence they complained about him to &lsquo;Uthmaan&hellip; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The prayer of an evildoer \r\n    or an innovator is itself valid, so if someone prays behind them his prayer \r\n    does not become invalid. But some scholars regarded praying behind them as \r\n    makrooh because it is obligatory to enjoin what is good and forbid what is \r\n    evil, and part of that (i.e., part of enjoining what is good and forbidding \r\n    what is evil) is that one who commits innovation or evil openly should not \r\n    be appointed to lead the Muslims, because he deserves to be punished or \r\n    rebuked until he repents. If it is possible to ostracize him until he \r\n    repents, that is good. If the fact that some people leave him and pray \r\n    behind someone else will have the effect of making him repent or causing his \r\n    dismissal, or will deter others from committing sins like him, in that case, \r\n    if they refrain from praying behind him, that will serve an interest and the \r\n    member of the congregation will not miss Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers or prayers in \r\n    congregation. Otherwise, if not praying behind him will make the member of \r\n    the congregation miss Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers or prayer in congregation, in that \r\n    case the one who stops praying behind him is an innovator who is going \r\n    against the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, if the imam has been appointed by the authorities, \r\n    and stopping praying behind him will not serve any purpose, then he should \r\n    not stop praying behind him, but praying behind the better imam is better. \r\n    See <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 23\/352.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam al-Tahhaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his\r\n    <i>&lsquo;Aqeedah<\/i>, in which he mentioned several basic principles of Ahl \r\n    al-Sunnah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We believe that we may \r\n    pray behind any Muslim who turns towards the qiblah in his prayers, \r\n    righteous or immoral, and we offer the funeral prayer for any Muslim who \r\n    dies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Along the same lines, Abu Dawood (594) narrated that Abu \r\n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The prescribed prayer is \r\n    obligatory and should be offered behind any Muslim, whether he is righteous \r\n    or immoral, even if he commits major sins.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Classed as weak by al-Albaani in <i>Da&rsquo;eef Abi Dawood<\/i>)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even though this hadeeth does not have any sound isnaad, as \r\n    was quoted in <i>&lsquo;Awn al-Ma&rsquo;bood<\/i> from al-&lsquo;Aqeeli and al-Haafiz ibn \r\n    Hajar, al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: But it is proven \r\n    that there was consensus among the people of the first era, the remaining \r\n    Sahaabah and the Taabi&rsquo;een who were with them, based on their actions, and \r\n    it is not farfetched to say that it was also based on their statments, that \r\n    they prayed behind unjust rulers, for the rulers at that time also led the \r\n    five daily prayers, and the people were not led in their prayers by anyone \r\n    other than their governors in every town that had a governor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, Imam al-Bukhaari entitled one of his \r\n    chapters <i>Baab imaamat al-Maftoon wa&rsquo;l-Mubtadi&rsquo;<\/i> (Chapter on immoral \r\n    people and innovators leading the prayer), then he narrated (695) from \r\n    &lsquo;Ubayd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Adiyy ibn Khiyaar that he entered upon &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he was under siege and said: \r\n    &ldquo;You are the imam of the people and there has befallen you what we see, and \r\n    now the imam of fitnah leads us in prayer and we are afraid of committing \r\n    sin.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Prayer is the best deed that people can do.

If \r\n    you can find an imam who is just and righteous, then pray with him, \r\n    otherwise pray with the imam you mentioned, and you will have the reward for \r\n    praying in congregation with him, and he will bear the burden of his \r\n    wrongdoing and evil actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5714","question_id":"5714","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Woman should be protected and concealed from men as much as her guardian can do \r\n    that.

Whoever catches up with one rak&rsquo;ah has caught up with the prayer.&rdquo; And because of the general meaning of the hadeeth narrated by the two \r\n    Shaykhs al-Bukhaari and Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on them) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When you come to the prayer do not rush. You should be calm and dignified. Whatever you \r\n    catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make up.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah is the Source of strength. May \r\n    Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Question:&nbsp; If a person catches up with the \r\n    final tashahhud before the imam says the tasleem, is he regarded as having caught up with the virtue of praying in congregation (jamaa&rsquo;ah), or \r\n    will he have the reward of one who prays alone? What is better if he enters the mosque when the imam is reciting the final tashahhud &ndash; should he \r\n    complete the tashahhud or is it better to wait for some others to come and pray with them?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Answer: The person who catches up with the \r\n    imam in the final tashahhud is not regarded as having caught up with the jamaa&rsquo;ah, but he will have a reward commensurate with however much of the \r\n    prayer he caught up with the imam in. Rather the one who is regarded as having caught up with the jamaa&rsquo;ah is the one who catches up with at least \r\n    one rak&rsquo;ah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever catches up with one rak&rsquo;ah of the prayer has \r\n    caught up with the prayer.&rdquo; It is better for him to join the imam, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth: &ldquo;Whatever you catch up with, \r\n    pray, and whatever you miss, make up.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 635; Muslim, 602.&nbsp; And Allaah is the Source of strength.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fataawa al-Lajnah, 7\/319-320&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5717","question_id":"5717","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When a person prays behind an imam, four \r\n    scenarios may apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Anticipation (doing a movement before the \r\n    imam)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Delay&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Doing an action simultaneously with the \r\n    imam&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Following&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Anticipation&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This refers to the person doing one of the \r\n    essential parts of prayer before the imam, such as prostrating or rising before the imam, or bowing or rising from bowing before him. This is \r\n    haraam, and the evidence for that is the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Do not bow until he bows, do not \r\n    prostrate until he prostrates.&rdquo; The basic principle is that the words &ldquo;do not&rdquo; indicate that the action is haraam, and if someone were to say that \r\n    it is a major sin, that would not be farfetched, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Does the one who \r\n    raises his head before the imam not fear that Allaah may turn his head into the head of a donkey, or make his form like that of a donkey?&rdquo; This is \r\n    a warning, and a warning is one of the signs that a sin is a major sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ruling on the prayer of one who anticipates \r\n    the imam:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If a person anticipates the imam knowingly, \r\n    aware of the ruling and of what he is doing, then his prayer is invalid. But if he is ignorant or forgot, then his prayer is valid, unless that \r\n    excuse ceased to exist before the imam did that action, in which case he has to go back and repeat what he did before the imam, after the imam. If \r\n    he does not do that, knowing the ruling and aware of what he is doing, then his prayer is invalid, otherwise it is not. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Delay&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are two kinds of delay in following the \r\n    imam:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span>\r\n    <span>Delay for a reason<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Delay without any excuse<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The first kind is where there is a reason or \r\n    excuse. He has to make up what he delayed, then he should follow the imam, and there will be no blame on him, even if it is one or two essential \r\n    parts of the prayer. So if a person is distracted or loses focus, or did not hear the imam until the imam has done one or two essential parts of \r\n    the prayer before him, then he should do the things that he delayed in and then follow the imam, unless the imam reaches the point where he is [in \r\n    the rak&rsquo;ah], in which case he should not make up the missing parts and he should stay with the imam. Then one rak&rsquo;ah will be valid for him which \r\n    is formed from two rak&rsquo;ahs of the imam, the rak&rsquo;ah in which he delayed and the rak&rsquo;ah which the imam reached the same point as him. An example of \r\n    that is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A man was praying with the imam and the imam \r\n    bowed, rose, prostrated, sat up, prostrated a second time and stood up, but the person praying behind him did not hear the loudspeaker except in \r\n    the second rak&rsquo;ah, because the electricity cut out for example. Let us assume that this was during Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer, so he heard the imam reciting \r\n    al-Faatihah, then the electricity cut out, and the imam completed the first rak&rsquo;ah, but the person remained standing thinking that the imam had \r\n    not yet bowed in the first rak&rsquo;ah, then he heard him reciting <i>&ldquo;Has there come to you the narration of the overwhelming \r\n    (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)?&rdquo; [al-Ghaashiyah 88:1 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We say: you should stay with the imam, so the second rak&rsquo;ah for the imam will be the rest of \r\n    the first rak&rsquo;ah for you. Then when the imam says the tasleem, you should make up the second rak&rsquo;ah. The scholars said: so the person praying \r\n    behind the imam will have one rak&rsquo;ah that is formed from the two rak&rsquo;ahs of his imam, because followed the imam in part of the first and part of \r\n    the second. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he realizes that he has lagged behind \r\n    before the imam reaches the same point [in the second rak&rsquo;ah], he should make it up and follow the imam. For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A man is standing with the imam, and the imam \r\n    bows but he does not hear that he is bowing. When the imam says &ldquo;<i>Sami&rsquo;a Allaahu liman hamidah<\/i> [Allaah hears those who praise Him &ndash; said \r\n    when rising from bowing], when the person praying behind him hears that, we say to him: Bow and rise, and follow your imam, and you will have \r\n    caught up with the rak&rsquo;ah, because the delay here was for a reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The second type is delaying with no excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Delaying with regard to an essential part of \r\n    the prayer means lagging behind in following the imam, but catching up with him in the next essential part of the prayer. For example, the imam \r\n    bows when you still have a verse or two left of the soorah you are reciting, so you remain standing to complete what you still have to recite, but \r\n    then you bow and catch up with the imam in rukoo&rsquo;. In this case the rak&rsquo;ah is valid, but your action goes against the Sunnah, because what is \r\n    prescribed is to start bowing when the imam reaches the bowing posture and not to lag behind, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When he bows, then bow.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Lagging behind in an essential part of the \r\n    prayer means that the imam is one step ahead of you in the prayer, i.e., he bows and rises before you bow. The fuqaha&rsquo; (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    them) said: if you lag behind in rukoo&rsquo; then your prayer is invalid, just as if you did rukoo&rsquo; before the imam. If you lag behind in sujood \r\n    (prostration) then according to what the fuqaha&rsquo; say your prayer is valid, because it is lagging behind in an essential part of the prayer other \r\n    than rukoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But the correct view is that if a person lags \r\n    behind the imam in any essential part of the prayer with no excuse, then his prayer is invalid, whether that is in rukoo&rsquo; or any other part of the \r\n    prayer. Based on this, if the imam rises from the first prostration and this person who is praying behind him is making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in sujood and \r\n    continues to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; until the imam prostrates for the second time, then his prayer is invalid, because he has lagged behind in an essential \r\n    part of the prayer. If the imam is one step ahead of him, how can he then be following him?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Doing an action simultaneously with the \r\n    imam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This refers either to word or actions, and \r\n    falls into two categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The first category is say words \r\n    simultaneously. This does not matter, except in the case of the takbeerat al-ihraam (saying &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo; to start the prayer) and the salaam \r\n    (at the end of the prayer).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the first takbeer, if you say \r\n    takbeer before the imam has completed his takbeerat al-ihraam, you have not entered prayer in the first place, because it is essential to say the \r\n    takbeerat al-ihraam after the imam has finished saying it completely.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the salaam, the scholars said \r\n    that it is makrooh to say the first and second salaam at the same time as your imam, but if you say the first salaam after he has said the first \r\n    salaam and the second salaam after he has said the second salaam, there is nothing wrong with this, but it is better not to say the salaam until \r\n    the imam has said both.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to all other words of the prayer, \r\n    it does not matter if you say them simultaneously with the imam, or before him, or after him. If we assume that you hear the imam reciting the \r\n    tashahhud, and you have already recited it, this does not matter, because anticipating the imam in the words of prayer, apart from the first \r\n    takbeer and the salaam, does not affect the prayer. Similarly it does not matter if you recite al-Faatihah before him and say <i>Wa laa&rsquo;l-daalleen<\/i>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;nor of those who went astray&rdquo; [al-Faatihaah 1:7 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>, whilst he is \r\n    still reciting <i>Iyyaaka na&rsquo;abudu wa iyyaaka nasta&rsquo;een<\/i> <i>&ldquo;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for \r\n    each and everything)<\/i>&rdquo; <i>[al-Faatihaah 1:7 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>, in Zuhr prayer, for example, because it \r\n    is prescribed in Zuhr and&nbsp; &lsquo;Asr prayer for the imam to let the people hear the verse he is reciting sometimes, as the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The second category is to do the actions of \r\n    prayer simultaneously with the imam, and this is makrooh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For example, when the imam says &ldquo;Allaahu \r\n    akbar&rdquo; for rukoo&rsquo;, and starts to bend forward, and you start to bow simultaneously with the imam, this is makrooh, because the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;When he bows, then bow, and do not bow until he bows.&rdquo; And in sujood when he says takbeer for \r\n    sujood, if you prostrate and reach the floor at the same time as him, this is makrooh, because the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) disallowed that and said, &ldquo;Do nor prostrate until he prostrates.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Following&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Following is the Sunnah, and what it means is \r\n    that a person starts to do the actions of prayer immediately after the imam starts them, but without doing them at the same time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For example, when he bows, you bow, even if \r\n    you have not completed the recitation that is mustahabb [recommended, encouraged], and even if you have a verse still to go, because that would \r\n    mean that you are lagging behind, so you do not complete it. In sujood, when the imam rises from his prostration, you follow the imam, and your \r\n    following him is better than your remaining in prostration making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; to Allaah, because your prayer is connected to the imam, and you are now \r\n    enjoined to follow your imam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Adapted from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    4\/275&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The person who is praying behind an imam should not move to the next posture of the prayer \r\n    until the imam has reached it, so he should not start to go down for prostration, until the imam has placed his forehead on the ground.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Bara&rsquo; ibn &lsquo;Aazib said: When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &lsquo;<i>Sami&rsquo;a \r\n    Allaahu liman hamidah&rsquo;<\/i>, none of us would then bend our backs [to start prostrating] until the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) went down into prostration, then we would go down into prostration after him.

Shaykh Abu \r\n    Haamid and al-Maawirdi said: Completing a thing can only be done after doing \r\n    the first part of it.

So whoever catches up with \r\n    one rak&rsquo;ah of Maghrib, that is regarded as being the first part of his \r\n    prayer. So he should stand up after the imam says the salaam and make up \r\n    what he missed. In the first rak&rsquo;ah he makes up he should recite al-Faatihah \r\n    and another soorah or verses, because it is the second rak&rsquo;ah for him. Then \r\n    he should sit and recite the first tashahhud. Then when he stands up to make \r\n    up the remaining rak&rsquo;ah of Maghrib he should recite al-Faatihah only, \r\n    because it is the third rak&rsquo;ah for him. Then he should sit and recite the \r\n    final tashahhud. If what he missed of Maghrib was one rak&rsquo;ah, and he caught \r\n    up with two rak&rsquo;ahs with the imam, then he should recite al-Faatihah only in \r\n    the last rak&rsquo;ah that he makes up after the imam says the salaam, because it \r\n    is the third rak&rsquo;ah for him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is a four-rak&rsquo;ah prayer and he catches up with three or \r\n    two rak&rsquo;ahs with the imam, then he should recite al-Faatihah only in the one \r\n    or two rak&rsquo;ahs that he makes up, because that is the latter part of the \r\n    prayer for him, so he does not have to recite another soorah as well as \r\n    al-Faatihah.

If he leads a non-mahram woman in prayer and \r\n    is alone with her, that is haraam for him and for her, because of the saheeh \r\n    ahaadeeth that I will quote below, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he leads (a number of) non-mahram woman in prayer and is \r\n    alone with them, the majority of scholars said that this is permissible, and \r\n    this was narrated by al-Raafa&rsquo;i in <i>Kitaab al-&lsquo;Adad<\/i> from our \r\n    companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    His evidence is the hadeeth which we will quote below, in sha \r\n    Allah, and because when there are a number of women together, a man cannot \r\n    usually behave inappropriately one of them in the presence of the others. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the ahaadeeth mentioned above, one of them is \r\n    the report narrated from &lsquo;Uqbah ibn &lsquo;Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him), \r\n    that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Beware of entering upon women.&rdquo; A man from among the Ansaar \r\n    said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about the in-law?&rdquo; He said: \r\n    The in-law is death.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. The &ldquo;in-law&rdquo; \r\n    refers to the husband&rsquo;s relatives; what is meant here is a relative who is \r\n    not her mahram, such as the husband&rsquo;s brother, paternal uncle, cousin, \r\n    maternal uncle, etc. The husband&rsquo;s father, son and grandfather are mahrams \r\n    and it is permissible for them to be alone with his wife, even though they \r\n    are also in-laws.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;No one of you should be alone with a woman unless a mahram \r\n    is present.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Amr ibn al-&lsquo;Aas (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said from the pulpit: &ldquo;After this day, no man should \r\n    enter in secret upon a woman whose husband is absent unless there is another \r\n    man or two with him.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by a woman whose husband is absent means one \r\n    whose husband is not in the house, even if he is in the same town. <i>\r\n    Al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/173, 174.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The phrase &ldquo;leading a non-mahram woman or women in prayer who \r\n    have no man with them&rdquo; means: it is makrooh to lead a non-mahram woman or \r\n    women in prayer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the author says requires further explanation:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If there is one non-mahram woman on her own, then to say that \r\n    it is only makrooh requires further explanation, if that means being alone \r\n    with her. Hence it was interpreted in <i>al-Rawd<\/i> as meaning that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a man to be \r\n    alone with a non-mahram woman. But we say: If he is alone with her then it \r\n    is haraam for him to lead her in prayer, because that which may lead to \r\n    something haraam is also haraam. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If there is more than one woman, i.e., if he leads two women \r\n    in prayer, this is also subject to further discussion as to whether it is \r\n    makrooh, because if there is a second woman along with the first, this means \r\n    that khulwah (being alone with a non-mahram member of the opposite sex) is \r\n    no longer an issue, and if the man is trustworthy there is nothing wrong \r\n    with him leading the two women in prayer. This happens sometimes in some \r\n    mosques where the congregation is small, especially with regard to qiyaam \r\n    al-layl in Ramadaan, when a man comes to the mosque and finds no men there, \r\n    but he does find two or three or four women in the back of the mosque. \r\n    According to what this author is saying, it is makrooh for him to lead these \r\n    two or three or four women in prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the correct view is that this is not makrooh, and that if \r\n    he leads two or more women in prayer, there is no khulwah and it is not \r\n    makrooh, unless he is afraid of fitnah (temptation). If he is afraid of \r\n    fitnah, then it is haraam, because whatever is a means that may lead to \r\n    something haraam is also haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>From the phrase &ldquo;if there \r\n    is no man with them&rdquo; we may understand that if there is a man with them, \r\n    then it is not makrooh, this is clear. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/250-252.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5721","question_id":"5721","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Praying in congregation \r\n    is one of the greatest outward symbols of our faith.

This is the well known view of Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him), although there is another view reported from him which says that it \r\n    is valid. The view that the prayer of a person who stands on his own behind \r\n    the row is valid is the view of the other three imams, Maalik, Abu Haneefah \r\n    and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But the more correct view \r\n    is that it is not valid to pray behind the row on one&rsquo;s own, unless there is \r\n    no room to stand in the row. If the row is full and a person prays behind \r\n    the row standing on his own and following the imam, then he is excused, and \r\n    one is not obliged to do something that one is unable to do, as was stated \r\n    by the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh<\/i>, 15\/193&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In order for the one who does this action that has been asked \r\n    about to understand the seriousness of it, you should know that some of the \r\n    scholars are the view that the prayer of the one who prays on his own behind \r\n    the row is invalid in all cases, even if he cannot find a space in the row. \r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>: If a man enters the mosque \r\n    and the iqaamah for prayer has been given and the row is full, he should try \r\n    to enter the row. If he cannot do that then he should join the imam and \r\n    stand on his right. If he cannot do that then he should wait for someone \r\n    else to come with whom he can form a new row. If no one else comes then he \r\n    should pray on his own after the congregational prayer finishes. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The same details were \r\n    mentioned in another answer given by the Committee, in which it says that it \r\n    is not sufficient to stand next to boys if they are under the age of \r\n    discernment. They said: with regard to standing next to boys, if they have \r\n    reached the age of discernment then standing next to them is valid, but if \r\n    they have not reached the age of discernment then the ruling is the same as \r\n    that on one who stands on his own behind the row, and the prayer of one who \r\n    stands on his own behind the row is not valid, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no prayer for \r\n    one who stands on his own behind the row.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah<\/i>, 8\/6-7&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly the situation which you have asked about goes \r\n    completely against the wisdom behind prayer in congregation. Anyone who has \r\n    the slightest understanding of the aims and purposes of sharee&rsquo;ah would \r\n    reject this. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said, after quoting the two ahaadeeth which are stated as evidence that the \r\n    prayer of one who prays on his own behind the row is invalid:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    More than one of the scholars of hadeeth have classed these \r\n    two hadeeths as saheeh, and their isnaads are strong. Indeed, in many cases \r\n    those who disagree with them rely on reports that have weaker isnaads than \r\n    these two. There is nothing in these two hadeeths that goes against the \r\n    basic principles of Islam, rather what is in them is what is implied by the \r\n    well known texts and the basic principles, because prayer in congregation is \r\n    called jamaa&rsquo;ah because it brings together (ijtimaa&rsquo;) the worshippers in \r\n    doing something at the same time and in the same place. If they cancel out \r\n    that unity of time or place, such as if all or some of them were to stand in \r\n    front of the imam, or to keep far back from him with no excuse, that is \r\n    forbidden according to scholarly consensus. Similarly if they were to be \r\n    scattered instead of standing together, this is something which is most \r\n    emphatically forbidden. Rather they are commanded to stand firmly and \r\n    closely together, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) commanded them to make the rows compact, straight and close \r\n    together, and to fill all the gaps, starting from the front row. This is all \r\n    aimed at joining them together in the best way possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If forming rows was not obligatory, then it would be \r\n    permissible for one person to stand behind another and so on. Everyone knows \r\n    that this is not the way that Muslims pray. If that were permissible then \r\n    the Muslims would have done it, even if only once. The same would apply if \r\n    they made the rows uneven, with one standing ahead of another and one \r\n    standing back from another. But that is something that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If they pray in front of the imam, this is better than \r\n    praying without organized rows. If the majority of scholars say that praying \r\n    ahead of the imam is not correct, either in all cases or if there is no \r\n    excuse, how could prayer be valid without having properly organized rows?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Study of the original sources shows that it is obligatory to \r\n    pray in rows, and that the prayer of one who stands alone is not valid, as \r\n    it says in these two hadeeths. If any scholar disagreed with that, then \r\n    undoubtedly this Sunnah did not reach him in a trustworthy report; he may \r\n    not have heard it at all, or he may have thought that the hadeeth was da&rsquo;eef \r\n    (weak), as some of them said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam<\/i>, \r\n    23\/393-395&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Try to offer advice to \r\n    this brother who is doing this, and tell him of the Sunnah of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the fact that he \r\n    forbade doing such things.

If the imam thinks that \r\n    something is mustahabb but the people praying behind him do not think it is \r\n    mustahabb, and he omits it for the sake of harmony, he has done well. An \r\n    example of that is Witr: there are three scholarly opinions concerning it:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That it can only be offered as three rak&rsquo;ahs joined \r\n    together, like Maghrib, as was the view of some of the people of Iraq;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That it can only be a single rak&rsquo;ah offered separately \r\n    from those that come before it, as was the view of some of the people of the \r\n    Hijaaz;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; That both are permissible, as appears to be the view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ahmad and others, and this is the correct view. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If these people are of the view that it should be separate \r\n    from whatever comes before, and if the imam is of the view that it should be \r\n    separate, but the people praying behind him favour the view that Witr should \r\n    be like Maghrib, and he goes along with them in the interests of harmony, \r\n    then he has done well, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah: &ldquo;Were it not that your people are new in Islam, \r\n    I would have knocked down the Ka&rsquo;bah, made its door level with the ground, \r\n    and I would have given it two doors, one through which the people could \r\n    enter and another through which they could exit.&rdquo; But he chose to forego \r\n    that which he thought was better, so as not to upset the people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said in <i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i> (2\/320):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam does not do \r\n    something that the person praying behind him thinks is obligatory there are \r\n    two opinions concerning that. The more correct of them is that the prayer of \r\n    the person praying behind the imam is valid. This is the view of Maalik and \r\n    the clearer of the two reports narrated from Ahmad concerning such matters. \r\n    This is also narrated from al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because he used to pray behind the \r\n    Maalikis who do not recite the Basmalah, but his view is that it is \r\n    obligatory to recite it. The evidence for that is the report narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari and others, that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;They lead you in prayer and if they get it right, it is \r\n    for you and for them, and if they make a mistake it is for you and against \r\n    them.&rdquo; So he said that the imam&rsquo;s mistake counts against him but not against \r\n    the one who prays behind him. So if the imam&rsquo;s view is the correct one in \r\n    such cases, then there is no dispute; if he is mistaken then his mistake \r\n    affects him alone. The one who thinks that the person praying behind the \r\n    imam should not follow him in that says: the person praying behind the imam \r\n    thinks that his imam&rsquo;s prayer is invalid. Shaykh al-Islam said: That is not \r\n    the case, rather he thinks that the imam is praying on the basis of ijtihaad \r\n    or taqleed; if he gets it right then he will have two rewards and if he gets \r\n    it wrong he will still have one reward.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And he said in <i>\r\n    al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah <\/i>(70):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the imam does \r\n    something that is forbidden in the eyes of the one who is praying behind him \r\n    but not in his own eyes, which is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, then \r\n    his prayer offered behind him is valid. This is the well-known view narrated \r\n    from Ahmad. And he said: The reports narrated from Ahmad may appear \r\n    contradictory but they are not, rather the apparent meaning is that in every \r\n    case where a person is certain that the imam has made a mistake,&nbsp; then he \r\n    has to repeat the prayer, and in every case&nbsp; where there is no such \r\n    certainty, then he should not repeat the prayer. This is what is indicated \r\n    by the Sunnah and the reports. There is a well-known dispute on this point \r\n    among the scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So you have to follow the \r\n    imam, because this is a matter of ijtihaad concerning which the imams \r\n    differed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you can advise the \r\n    imam and explain the Sunnah to him, with evidence, then this is what you \r\n    should do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5726","question_id":"5726","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, two people are enough to pray in congregation, whether \r\n    that is in the house or elsewhere.

The imam should stand \r\n    in the middle with the worshippers behind him. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (3\/10):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Straightening the rows also means preferring the right side \r\n    to the left, but that is not to be taken in absolute terms, as is the case \r\n    with regard to the first row, because if it were in absolute terms as is the \r\n    case with regard to the first row, the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said, &ldquo;Complete the rows from \r\n    the right hand side&rdquo; but he said: &ldquo;Complete the first row, then the next.&rdquo; \r\n    Since it is not prescribed to start the rows from the right until they are \r\n    completed, then we should look at the basic principles of sharee&rsquo;ah to see \r\n    how this should be done with regard to the left. We find that with regard to \r\n    the left, if the right and the left are more or less equal, then the right \r\n    side is given preference, such as if there are five on the left and five on \r\n    the right, and an eleventh man comes, we would tell him to go to the right, \r\n    because the right is better than the left when both are equal or almost \r\n    equal, and there is no obvious difference between the right and the left of \r\n    the row. But if one side is further away, then there is no doubt that \r\n    joining the left if it is closer is better than joining the right if it is \r\n    far away. This is indicated by the fact that if there is a group of three, \r\n    it is prescribed for the imam to stand between the other two. This indicates \r\n    that the right is not better in absolute terms, because if it were better in \r\n    absolute terms, it would be better for both people to be to the right of the \r\n    imam. But it is prescribed for one to be on the right of the imam and one on \r\n    his left so that the imam will be in the middle and there will be no \r\n    imbalance between the two sides. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: Should the two begin from the \r\n    right or from behind the imam? Is it prescribed to achieve balance between \r\n    the right and left so that it may be said &ldquo;Make the row equal on both sides&rdquo; \r\n    as many imams do?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: The row should start from the middle, from behind \r\n    the imam. And the right side of each row is better than the left. A new row \r\n    should not be started until the one in front is completed. There is nothing \r\n    wrong with there being more people on the right side of a row, and there is \r\n    no need to make the row equal on both sides, rather the command to do that \r\n    is contrary to the Sunnah. But people should not form a second row until the \r\n    first is complete, or form a third row until the second is complete, and so \r\n    on, because it is proven that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that.

The second issue is the ruling on \r\n    stepping over people in order to reach a gap in the front row.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (2\/101):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he sits in a place, \r\n    then he leaves it because he wants to do something or he needs to do wudoo&rsquo;, \r\n    he may leave [i.e., even if that means that he has to step over people] \r\n    &lsquo;Uqbah said: I prayed &lsquo;Asr behind the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) in Madeenah, then he said the salaam then he got up \r\n    quickly and stepped over the people until he reached the apartment of one of \r\n    his wives, and he said: &ldquo;I remembered some gold nuggets that we had and I \r\n    did not want to be distracted by it, so I gave instructions that it be \r\n    shared out.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari&hellip; If he gets up and leaves his spot then \r\n    comes back, he has more right to it&hellip; The ruling with regard to stepping over \r\n    people in order to reach one&rsquo;s spot is the same as one who sees a gap in \r\n    front of him. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he sees a gap which he \r\n    can only reach by stepping over people, two views have been narrated \r\n    concerning this. According to one view, he may step over them. Ahmad said: A \r\n    man go forward as far as he can, and he should not leave any empty space in \r\n    front of him. If he is unaware of that and he leaves an empty space in front \r\n    of him, one who comes after him should fill it and pass by him to reach the \r\n    empty space. There is no &ldquo;sanctity&rdquo; for one who has left an empty space in \r\n    front of him and has sat elsewhere. Al-Awzaa&rsquo;i said: He should move past \r\n    them to the space. Qataadah said: He may move past them to the spot where he \r\n    wants to pray. Al-Hasan said: Step over those who are sitting at the doors \r\n    of the mosque, for they have no sanctity. Another report was narrated from \r\n    Ahmad, according to which there is nothing wrong with stepping over one or \r\n    two, because it is an insignificant matter and may be overlooked, but if one \r\n    steps over many people, we regard that as makrooh. This was also the view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i. But if there is no other way to reach the spot where one will \r\n    pray, then he may step over people, in sha Allaah. Perhaps the view of Ahmad \r\n    and those who agreed with him in the first report applies to those who have \r\n    left a wide space, like those who form rows at the back of the mosque and \r\n    leave empty rows in front of them, who have no sanctity as al-Hasan said, \r\n    because they have gone against the command of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and have turned away from the best rows and \r\n    sat in the worst, and because there is no option but to step over them; and \r\n    his other opinion has to do with those who have not been heedless, because \r\n    the rows in front of them are full, and they sat wherever they could. If it \r\n    is not possible to pray without squeezing in and stepping over them, then it \r\n    is permissible, because that is a case of need. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (4\/420):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he sees a gap in front of them, and he cannot reach it \r\n    except by stepping over them, then our companions said that it is not \r\n    makrooh to step over them, because those who are sitting behind it have been \r\n    negligent in not filling the gap, whether there are other gaps or not, and \r\n    whether it is close to them or not. But if there is another spot available, \r\n    it is better not to step over them. If there is a closer spot and he can \r\n    reach it without stepping over more than two men, then he may go there. If \r\n    it is far away and he hopes that they will move forward and fill it when the \r\n    iqaamah for prayer is given, then it is mustahabb for him to sit where he is \r\n    and not step over people, otherwise he may do that. And it is narrated that \r\n    Qataadah said: He may step over them to reach his spot. It was narrated from \r\n    Abu Nasr that it is permissible to do that with their permission. Ibn \r\n    al-Mundhir said: It is not permissible to do any of that in my view, because \r\n    it is haraam to cause annoyance, whether a lot or a little. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz narrated in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> (2\/433) that Imam \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is makrooh to step \r\n    over people, except for one who cannot find a place to pray except by doing \r\n    that. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then al-Haafiz said: This includes the imam and anyone who \r\n    wants to reach a broken row if those who came before him refuse to do so, \r\n    and one who wants to reach a spot that he left for a necessary reason. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 5\/70:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If someone were to say: \r\n    the hadeeth &ldquo;Sit for you have caused annoyance&rdquo; is general in meaning, \r\n    because the apparent situation is that there was a gap, because people do \r\n    not usually step over others unless there is a gap, our response is that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo; (may Allaah have mercy on them) made an exception \r\n    in this case and said: Because if there is a gap, they are the ones who have \r\n    wronged themselves, because they have gone against the command to fill the \r\n    gaps in the rows, and in that case the negligence is on their part, and is \r\n    not the fault of the one who steps over them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But what I think is that he should not step over them even if \r\n    there is a gap because the reason, which is annoyance, is still present. \r\n    There may be some reason why they did not go forward and fill the gap, such \r\n    as if the gap is not large but it became larger as people shifted position. \r\n    In that case it is not negligence on their part, so it is better to follow \r\n    the general meaning which is that he should not step over people to reach \r\n    the gap. But if he steps over some people and asks permission to do so in \r\n    order to reach this gap, then I hope that there is nothing wrong with that. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that with regard to stepping over people, one of \r\n    the following two scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That it is done for no reason. This is haraam because \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, \r\n    they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Ahzaab 33:58]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man who stepped over \r\n    people: &ldquo;Sit down, for you are causing annoyance.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That it is done for a reason, in which case there is \r\n    nothing wrong with it in sha Allaah.

In fact he may be prevented from entering the mosque until his \r\n    illness has gone away, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) forbade bringing a sick individual among healthy ones, as \r\n    al-Bukhaari (6771) and Muslim (2221) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah \r\n    be pleased with him) that he said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;No sick one should be put with a healthy one.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information on the issue of contagion, please see \r\n    the answer to question no.

In \r\n    this case the individual is excused and is not obliged to pray in \r\n    congregation because of his sickness and because of the fear of contagion, \r\n    because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade the \r\n    one who has eaten garlic or onions to come to the mosque lest the people be \r\n    bothered by his smell, and this one (i.e. the one who is sick) is obviously \r\n    more bothersome than one who has eaten something that has an offensive \r\n    smell.

We do not know of any evidence \r\n    that suggests that a newly married man is allowed not to pray in \r\n    congregation, apart from a few fuqaha&rsquo; who stated that the one who is \r\n    waiting for his bride to be brought to him is excused from praying in \r\n    congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked about his opinion on this and he said: We think that the views of the \r\n    scholars may include those that are wrong and those that are right. What is \r\n    essential is to refer to the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars who said this were speaking about something that \r\n    they used to do, whereby it was the man who received the bride, and the \r\n    bride did not receive the man. The man would be in his house and his wife \r\n    would be brought to him, and this was an excuse for not praying in \r\n    congregation, because if he went and prayed in the mosque, he would not be \r\n    focusing on his prayer because his mind would be distracted, and the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no prayer \r\n    when food is ready.&rdquo; Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) would hear \r\n    the imam reciting whilst he was eating dinner and he would not get up to \r\n    pray until he had finished eating. If a man is excused for not attending \r\n    prayer in congregation in this case, then the one who is waiting for his \r\n    bride to be brought to him is more distracted, so the excuse is obvious. But \r\n    the custom of people nowadays in our country is different from that; the \r\n    groom comes to the bride where she is, so it is up to him and he has no \r\n    excuse for not praying in congregation.

Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) was asked about someone who did not pray Fajr on the morning of his \r\n    wedding and his answer was: The groom has to pray Fajr in congregation and \r\n    not fail to pray in congregation with no legitimate excuse.

Although straightening the rows is obligatory, the prayer of \r\n    those who fail to do that and do not straighten their rows is still valid. \r\n    That is supported by the fact that although Anas criticized them, he did not \r\n    tell them to repeat their prayer.

They quoted as evidence for that \r\n    the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    enjoined it and warned those who went against his command. If something is \r\n    enjoined and a warning issued against doing the opposite, it cannot be said \r\n    that it is &ldquo;only Sunnah&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence the correct view on \r\n    this matter is that it is obligatory to straighten the rows, and if the \r\n    congregation does not straighten the rows, then they are sinning.

End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 3\/6&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Straightening the rows is \r\n    obligatory so that no one will stand in front of anyone else, whether that \r\n    is by his chest or his foot sticking out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in &lsquo;<i>Awn al-Ma&rsquo;bood<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by straightening the rows is for the people \r\n    standing in the row to make a straight line. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Straightening the rows means that no one stands in front of \r\n    anyone else, but is what is meant that the foot should not be in front of \r\n    anyone else&rsquo;s foot? The answer is that what is meant is the shoulders at the \r\n    top of the body, and the heels at the bottom of the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Attention is paid to the heels because they are the \r\n    foundation on which the body rests. The heel is at the bottom of the leg, \r\n    and the leg is the pillar of the body, so this is what matters. As for the \r\n    toes, they do not count, because toes vary; some people have long feet and \r\n    some have short feet, so what matters is the heel.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is another kind of straightening that means \r\n    completeness or perfection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And when he attained his full strength, and was perfect \r\n    (in manhood)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Qasas 28:14]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Here the word astawa \r\n    (translated as &lsquo;was perfect&rsquo;) means: was made complete. If we say istiwa&rsquo; \r\n    al-sufoof (straightening of the rows) in the sense of completeness, that \r\n    does not detract from the meaning of straightening them in the sense of \r\n    ensuring that everyone stands parallel, rather it encompasses a number of \r\n    meanings:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Straightness in the sense of standing parallel, which \r\n    according to the correct view is obligatory, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Making the rows compact, which is part of making them \r\n    complete or perfect. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) used to enjoin that, and he urged his ummah to form rows as the angels \r\n    do before their Lord, filling in and completing the rows one by one. But \r\n    what is meant by making the rows compact is not leaving gaps for the devils; \r\n    it does not mean crowding and cramming people in, because there is a \r\n    difference between making it compact and making it crowded. Hence the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: &ldquo;Make \r\n    the rows straight, and make the shoulders parallel&hellip; and do not leave gaps \r\n    for the devils.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    i.e., there should be no gaps between you through which the \r\n    devils can enter, because the devils enter among the rows like small lambs \r\n    so that they can spoil the prayer of the worshippers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Completing the first row and then the next. This is part \r\n    of straightening the rows. The second row should not be begun until the \r\n    first row is completed, and the third row should not be begun until the \r\n    second row is completed, and so on. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) urged completing the first row and said: &ldquo;If the people \r\n    knew what there is in the call and the first row, but they had no way other \r\n    than drawing lots, then they would draw lots.&rdquo; I.e., if two people came to \r\n    the first row and one of them said, &ldquo;I am more entitled to it than you,&rdquo; and \r\n    the other said, &ldquo;I am more entitled,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Let us draw lots to see \r\n    which of us will be in this spot.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the ways in which the Shaytaan plays with people \r\n    nowadays is when they see that the first row is only half full, but despite \r\n    that they start the second row, then when the iqaamah is given, and it is \r\n    said to them,&nbsp; &ldquo;Complete the first row,&rdquo; they start looking around in \r\n    confusion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Another aspect of straightening the rows is making the \r\n    rows close to one another and close to the imam, because they are a jamaa&rsquo;ah \r\n    (congregation, group) and the word jamaa&rsquo;ah is taken from the word ijtimaa&rsquo; \r\n    (coming together). There can be no proper coming together if the rows are \r\n    far apart. The closer the rows are to one another and to the imam, the \r\n    better it is. In some mosques we see gaps between the imam and the first row \r\n    that are so wide that another row or two could fit in, because the imam goes \r\n    so far forward. I think that this stems from ignorance. The Sunnah is for \r\n    the imam to be close to the people who are praying behind him, and the \r\n    people should be close to the imam, and each row should be close to the \r\n    other. The definition of close is that there should be enough room between \r\n    them to prostrate and a little more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Another aspect of straightening the rows is to draw close \r\n    to the imam, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Let those among you who are men of wisdom and understanding be \r\n    closest to me.&rdquo; The closer the better. Hence it is encouraged to draw close \r\n    to the imam in Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers, because drawing close to the imam in Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    prayers is achieved by drawing close to him during the prayer and during the \r\n    khutbah. Drawing close to the imam is something desirable, but some people \r\n    are negligent concerning that and are not keen to do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; Another aspect of straightening the rows is preferring \r\n    the right hand side of the row to the left, i.e., the right side of the row \r\n    is better than the left, but that is not in absolute terms, as in the case \r\n    of the first row, because if it was in absolute terms, as in the case of the \r\n    first row, the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    would have said, &ldquo;Complete the right side then the right side,&rdquo; as he said, \r\n    &ldquo;Complete the first row then the next.&rdquo; The right side is better than the \r\n    left if both right and left are roughly equal, such as if there are five on \r\n    the right and five on the left, then the eleventh man comes. In that case we \r\n    tell him: Go to the right, because the right is better when both sides are \r\n    equal or almost equal, such that the difference between the right and left \r\n    is not obvious. But if there is a difference, then undoubtedly the left side \r\n    of a closer row is better than the right side of a more distant row. This is \r\n    indicated by the fact that if the congregation is just three people, the \r\n    imam should stand between them, i.e., between the other two. This indicates \r\n    that the right is not better in absolute terms, because if it were better in \r\n    absolute terms, it would be better for the two people to stand on the right \r\n    of the imam, but what is prescribed is that one should be on the right and \r\n    one on the left so that the imam is in the middle and there is no imbalance \r\n    on one side.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; Another aspect of straightening the rows is that the \r\n    women should stand on their own, i.e., the women should be behind the men, \r\n    not mixed with the men, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best rows for men are the first rows and the \r\n    worst are the last, and the best rows for women are the last rows and the \r\n    worst are the first.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) stated that the further women are behind the men, the better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it is better for women to be far behind the men, because \r\n    of the fitnah involved in their being close to men. Worse than that is their \r\n    mixing with the men, where a woman would be beside a man or a row of women \r\n    would be between two rows of men. This is not appropriate and as well as \r\n    being haraam there is the fear of fitnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is more likely to be \r\n    haraam when there is the fear of fitnah, but even when there is no fitnah, \r\n    this is still not appropriate, such as if the women are mahram of the men.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 3\/13-17.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5746","question_id":"5746","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The matter is broad in scope and a person may stand up at the \r\n    beginning of the iqaamah or in the middle of it or after it finishes.

He always goes out to pray in the mosque, but his \r\n    colleagues pray at the company&rsquo;s door, and they want him to pray with them \r\n    in the building and not go to the mosque. Some of his brothers suggested \r\n    that he should pray with them and give a lesson to them after the prayer, on \r\n    the grounds that he has more knowledge of the Sunnah then them, and he \r\n    should lead them in prayer, even though there are others there who know more \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan than he does.&nbsp; Should he listen to their advice, or should he \r\n    continue to pray in the mosque, regardless of what they said to him?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Answer:&nbsp; The \r\n    workers in this company should pray in congregation in one of the mosques \r\n    that are close to the company&rsquo;s building, as their colleague is doing. He is \r\n    doing the right thing by praying in the mosque, and they are mistaken by \r\n    praying at the company&rsquo;s door, because the saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicate that it is \r\n    obligatory to offer the prayer in congregation in the mosque, and it is not \r\n    permissible to stay away without a legitimate shar&rsquo;i excuse. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Shaykh \r\n    Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: We are a group of \r\n    employees working in a government department and there is a mosque close to \r\n    us, separated from us by a street that is only thirty metres wide and we can \r\n    hear the call to prayer clearly. But we pray in a musalla (prayer room) that \r\n    we have made in the office. We have read the fatwa of the Standing Committee \r\n    for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas which says that it is not \r\n    permissible to pray in a government department when there is a mosque \r\n    nearby, and that the employees must pray in the mosque. Our question is: Is \r\n    it permissible for us to pray in congregation in our office or must we pray \r\n    in the mosque? Is it permissible for our boss to force us to pray in the \r\n    office even though there is no shar&rsquo;i excuse for that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: \r\n    What you and your boss must do is pray in the mosque; it is not permissible \r\n    for you to fail to attend, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not \r\n    come to prayer, there is no prayer for him, except for the one who has an \r\n    excuse.&rdquo; Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) was asked what was \r\n    meant by an excuse and he said: &ldquo;Fear or sickness.&rdquo; And it is proven that a \r\n    blind man asked the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him): &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I do not have a guide to bring me to the \r\n    mosque; is there any concession that will allow me to pray at home?&rdquo; The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: &ldquo;Can \r\n    you hear the call to prayer?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Answer it.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Imam Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him), who was one of the companions of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I remember a \r\n    time when no one stayed away from it (the prayer) except a hypocrite who was \r\n    known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So what you \r\n    must all do is persist in praying in the mosque with the congregation, and \r\n    do not be like the enemies of Allaah, the hypocrites. May Allaah help you \r\n    and make things easy for you.

If the boss \r\n    fears that this is happening, then he has the right in that case to prevent \r\n    them from praying in the mosque, but he should oblige them to pray in the \r\n    workplace, to protect the interests of the work and to prevent negligence on \r\n    the part of some employees.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, \r\n    the work may require some employees to stay there so as to check on some \r\n    patients who require constant supervision, or some doctors to deal with \r\n    emergencies. In such cases there is no sin on the people who do not attend \r\n    prayer in congregation in the mosque, and they may pray in congregation in \r\n    the workplace if that is possible, but that should only be done by those who \r\n    need to do it, not all the doctors and employees. In the answer to question \r\n    no. [fatin]22185[\\fatin] we have explained that if a doctor is required by his work to be \r\n    present in the hospital at the time of Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer in order to deal with \r\n    emergencies, there is no sin on him if he misses Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer, but he must \r\n    pray Zuhr in the workplace.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the \r\n    administration insists on its attitude, and your continuing to go to the \r\n    mosque means that you will be fired, then it seems that those who need this \r\n    work are excused for not praying in congregation in the mosque, but they \r\n    should try to pray in congregation in the workplace. The fuqaha&rsquo; have stated \r\n    that one of the excuses that make it permissible to miss praying in \r\n    congregation is fear of losing livelihood that one needs, as is stated in <i>\r\n    Kashshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo;<\/i> (1\/496).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We ask \r\n    Allaah to guide you.<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah \r\n    knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5749","question_id":"5749","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Several scenarios may apply to holding a second \r\n    congregational prayer in the mosque, some of which are not allowed and some \r\n    are permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The kind which we should agree is forbidden is when this \r\n    second congregational prayer is held with prior agreement among these \r\n    people, such as if they agree to come to the mosque after the imam has \r\n    finished praying, then they pray in congregation. Similarly forbidden is \r\n    when this second prayer in congregation is something that happens regularly \r\n    in the mosque, in a systematic fashion, such as if it is said for example: \r\n    The first congregational prayer will be held at such and such a time, and \r\n    the second will be held at such and such a time, and this is something that \r\n    is done regularly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no dispute that these two scenarios are haraam, \r\n    because they are causing disunity among the Muslims and discouraging the \r\n    people from attending the first congregational prayer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the second congregational prayer is held in the mosque \r\n    on an occasional basis without any prior agreement, such as if a group of \r\n    people enters the mosque after the imam has finished the prayer and they \r\n    pray in congregation, then there is a difference of opinion among the \r\n    scholars concerning this. The correct view is that it is permissible and is \r\n    in fact mustahabb, because it brings the reward of praying in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    describing the scenarios of a second congregational prayer in the mosque: As \r\n    for the first scenario, if there are always two congregations in the mosque, \r\n    the first congregation and the second congregation, undoubtedly this is \r\n    makrooh, if not haraam, because it is bid&rsquo;ah (an innovation), and it was \r\n    unknown at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) and his companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example is what was known in al-Masjid al-Haraam \r\n    before the Saudi government took charge of it, where there were four \r\n    congregations, each of which had an imam: a Hanbali imam who led the \r\n    Hanbalis in prayer, a Shaafa&rsquo;i imam who led the Shaafa&rsquo;is, a Maaliki imam \r\n    who led the Maalikis and a Hanafi imam who led the Hanafis. They said: This \r\n    is the maqaam for the Shaafa&rsquo;i, this is the maqaam for the Maaliki, this is \r\n    the maqaam for the Hanafi and this is the maqaam for the Hanbali.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But when King &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez (may Allaah reward him with \r\n    good) entered Makkah, he said: This is dividing the ummah, i.e., the Muslim \r\n    ummah is being divided in one mosque, and this is not permissible. So he \r\n    united them behind one imam, and this was one of his good deeds and virtues \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What he referred to is one of the forbidden things, which is \r\n    dividing the ummah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, it promotes laziness, because people will say: So \r\n    long as there is a second congregational prayer, we will wait until the \r\n    second group comes, and the people will turn away from attending the first \r\n    congregational prayer with the regular imam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he mentioned the second scenario and said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the second scenario, which is when it happens without \r\n    prior agreement, i.e., the regular imam is the one who leads the \r\n    congregational prayer in the mosque, but sometimes two or three or more men \r\n    stay away for a valid excuse, then this is a matter concerning which the \r\n    scholars differed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars say that the congregational prayer \r\n    should not be repeated, i.e., they should pray individually.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of them say that it should be repeated, and this is the \r\n    correct view, and it is the view of the Hanbalis. The evidence for that is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: the hadeeth of Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b, according to which \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;For a \r\n    man to pray with another man is better than his praying alone, and for him \r\n    to pray with two other men is better than his praying with one other man. \r\n    The more men there are, the dearer it is to Allaah.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood \r\n    (554) and al-Nasaa&rsquo;i (843). This clearly shows that it is better for a man \r\n    to pray with another man than to pray alone. If we say that there should not \r\n    be another congregational prayer, this means that we are favouring the \r\n    less-favoured choice (i.e., praying alone), and this is contrary to the \r\n    text.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: One day the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) was sitting with his companions when a man came in after \r\n    the prayer had finished, and he said: &ldquo;Who will give charity to this man and \r\n    pray with him?&rdquo; One of the people got up and prayed with the man. Narrated \r\n    by al-Tirmidhi (220). This clearly shows that the congregational prayer may \r\n    be repeated after the regular congregation, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged someone to pray with this \r\n    man. If someone says that this was charity, but when two men pray in the \r\n    mosque when they have missed the prayer, the prayer of each of them is \r\n    obligatory,&nbsp; it may be said in response that if Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined doing an act of charity, and one \r\n    who had already prayed was commanded to pray with this man, how can one who \r\n    has not prayed not be commanded to pray with this man? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third scenario is when the mosque is in a marketplace or \r\n    on a highway and the like. If it is a marketplace mosque where people come \r\n    and go, and two or three or ten men come and pray and then leave, as happens \r\n    in the mosques that exist in some marketplaces, then it is not makrooh to \r\n    repeat the congregational prayer in this case. One of the scholars said: \r\n    There is consensus and there is no difference of opinion on this point, \r\n    because this mosque is a place where various groups come and go, and there \r\n    is no regular imam behind whom the people may unite. End quote from <i>\r\n    al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (4\/227-231).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we advise our brothers to do is to reconcile and strive \r\n    to unite and put an end to discord and disunity, and do away with \r\n    selfishness. They should adhere to this ritual which is one of the causes of \r\n    unity and harmony; how can they make it a means of dispute and disunity?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have an example in &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him), who criticized &lsquo;Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    for offering the prayer in full in Mina, but despite that he also offered \r\n    the prayer in full. When he was asked about that he said: &ldquo;Disunity is \r\n    evil.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood (1960).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another indication of the importance of striving to reconcile \r\n    people and bring them together is that a number of scholars stated that it \r\n    is permissible for the imam to omit some of the sunnahs in order to unite \r\n    the congregation, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said: If the imam thinks that something is mustahabb, but the people \r\n    praying behind him do not regard it as mustahabb, and he omits it for the \r\n    sake of unity and harmony, that is better. An example of that is Witr, \r\n    concerning which the scholars have three views: (1) that it can only be done \r\n    with three continuous rak&rsquo;ahs, like Maghrib, as is the view of the people of \r\n    Iraq; (2) that it can only be done with one rak&rsquo;ah separate from those that \r\n    precede it, as is the view of those among the people of the Hijaaz who held \r\n    this view; (3) that both are permissible, as is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, \r\n    Ahmad and others, and this is the correct view, even though they prefer that \r\n    it should be done with one separate rak&rsquo;ah. If the imam thinks that it \r\n    should be done with one separate rak&rsquo;ah, but the members of the congregation \r\n    think that Witr should be prayed like Maghrib, and he concurs with them in \r\n    order to bring about unity, that is better, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah: &ldquo;Were it not that your \r\n    people have only recently left Jaahiliyyah behind, I would have demolished \r\n    the Ka&rsquo;bah and levelled it to the ground, and rebuilt it with two doors, one \r\n    door for the people to enter and another door for them to exit.&rdquo; So he \r\n    refrained from doing that which was better in his view, so as not to \r\n    alienate the people. Similarly, if a man thinks that reciting Bismillaah out \r\n    loud is correct, but he elands in prayer people who hold a different view, \r\n    or vice versa, and he concurs with them, that is better.&nbsp; End quote from <i>\r\n    al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i> (2\/118).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to set our affairs and those of all the Muslims \r\n    straight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5750","question_id":"5750","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If two people come in and they find that there is only enough \r\n    room for one man in the first or second row, then they should stand \r\n    together, because if one of them joins the row the other will be left \r\n    standing on his own.

This is better for them \r\n    than doing an act of worship concerning which there is a difference of \r\n    scholarly opinion as to whether it is valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee issued a fatwa stating that it is not \r\n    valid to follow the imam in such cases, unless the rows are uninterrupted. \r\n    They were asked: What is the ruling on one who prays in congregation in his \r\n    house, listening to the loudspeakers of the mosque, and there is no \r\n    continuity of rows between the imam and him, as is the situation in Makkah \r\n    and Madeenah during Hajj season?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The prayer is not valid. That is the view of al-Shaaf&rsquo;i and \r\n    was also the view of Imam Ahmad, unless the rows are uninterrupted until \r\n    they reach his house and he is able to follow the imam by seeing him or \r\n    hearing his voice, in which case it is valid. But if the condition mentioned \r\n    is not met, it is not valid, because what is required of the Muslim is to \r\n    offer the prayer in congregation in the houses of Allaah with his fellow \r\n    Muslim, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever hears the call and does not come, there is no prayer for him, \r\n    except for the one who has an excuse.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-Daaraqutni \r\n    and al-Haakim.

By meeting \r\n    other Muslims he will renew his faith, raise his status, strengthen the \r\n    bonds of brotherhood and love, and make his children get used to loving and \r\n    respecting the mosque.

If you pray in your houses like this one who stays away from the \r\n    mosque prays in his house, you will have forsaken the Sunnah of your \r\n    Prophet, and if you forsake the Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. \r\n    There is no man who purifies himself and purifies himself well, then he goes \r\n    to one of these mosques, but Allaah will record one good deed for him for \r\n    every step he takes, and will raise him in status one degree thereby, and \r\n    will erase one bad deed thereby.

The accepting of money must \r\nbe the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and \r\nconduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this.&#160; Acts of \r\nworship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. <\/p>\r\n<align>Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which \r\nhe is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project.&#160; This suggestion is based on the \r\nfact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah \r\nregarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds.&#160; This category must be \r\nidentified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is:&#160; those officials appointed by \r\nthe <i>khalifah <\/i>of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, \r\nguarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it.&#160; Among the prerequisites \r\nrequired of those who collect zakaat are:&#160; that they are Muslim; that they are respected \r\nand trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not \r\ninclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the \r\nrequired Islamic <i>fiqh<\/i>, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able \r\nto perform the duties. <\/p>\r\n<align>It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a \r\nsalary from <i>bait ul-maal<\/i> from other funds.&#160; However, the official cannot take anything \r\nfrom the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any \r\ngifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic \r\n<i>ahaadeeth<\/i>. <\/p>\r\n<align>If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the \r\nkhalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it \r\nbecomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute \r\nit to those who deserve it.&#160; Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given \r\nus a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the \r\nIslamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim \r\ncountries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion \r\nof it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to \r\nadminister it. <\/p>\r\n<align><b><u>Important observation:<\/u><\/b> <\/p>\r\n<align>If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from <i>bait ul-maal<\/i> such as a \r\njudge (<i>qaadi<\/i>), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from \r\nthe zakaat because he already has an income taken from <i>bait ul-maal<\/i>.&#160; In addition, the \r\nduties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims \r\n(see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol \r\n6, p.188). <\/p>\r\n<align>If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being \r\namong the poor (<i>al-fuqaraa'<\/i>), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet \r\nhis needs.&#160; Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not \r\nto compromise his impartiality and sincerity. <\/p>\r\n<align>And Allah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is best most correct. <\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"5756","question_id":"5756","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If you enter the mosque \r\n    when the imam has stood up from bowing, then you should say the dhikr that \r\n    is prescribed at this point, which is Rabbana wa laka&rsquo;l-hamd, and you should \r\n    not say the opening du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, because its place is the beginning of the \r\n    prayer, and you should not say A&rsquo;oodhu Billaahi min al-shaytaan il-rajeem, \r\n    because its place is before recitation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari (689) and \r\n    Muslim (411) narrated from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;The imam has been appointed to be followed, so when he says takbeer, then \r\n    say takbeer; when he prostrates, then prostrate; when he rises, then rise, \r\n    and when he says, <i>Sami&rsquo;a Allaahu liman hamidah<\/i>, then say <i>Rabbana \r\n    wa laka&rsquo;l-hamd<\/i>.

The first category is when that is done regularly so that \r\n    the second congregation deliberately comes late in order that a second \r\n    congregation may be done. This is an innovation, because only one \r\n    congregational prayer should be done in the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second category is when that is not done regularly and \r\n    deliberately, but after the first congregation ends some other people come \r\n    into the mosque and they offer their prayer in congregation. This is \r\n    prescribed and is Sunnah, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) was with his Companions one day, and a man came in who had \r\n    missed the prayer, and he said: &ldquo; Who will be charitable towards this man \r\n    and pray with him?&rdquo; and one of the Companions got up and prayed with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s prayer offered with another man is better than his \r\n    praying on his own, and his praying with two other men is better than his \r\n    praying with one other man. The more there are the more beloved it is to \r\n    Allaah.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the notion held by the people that having a \r\n    second prayer in congregation is an innovation, that is correct if it is \r\n    done regularly and deliberately. But if it happens occasionally, then having \r\n    a second prayer in congregation is Sunnah, because of the command of the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him and his family).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Question: Even if it is done in the house after the first \r\n    prayer in congregation has ended?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: No, in the mosque is better, because if it is done in \r\n    the mosque the size of the congregation may increase and people who come \r\n    later may join it, so that will be better. Moreover, sometimes people go \r\n    from their houses to the mosque in order to pray with the congregation, but \r\n    they may miss it and find that they have already prayed, in which case \r\n    praying in the mosque is better for him and others, because if he and his \r\n    companion return home and offered a prayer in congregation there, another \r\n    person may come after the first prayer in congregation has ended and find no \r\n    congregation, so he misses out on praying in congregation. So it is better \r\n    for it to be in the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, if we assume that he knew when he was at home that the \r\n    prayer in congregation had ended, then in this case we say: It makes no \r\n    difference, pray in your house, because if he goes out to the mosque he may \r\n    feel embarrassed to meet people when they are coming out from the prayer, so \r\n    he may pray in his house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he has come and entered the mosque, and found that \r\n    they have already prayed, he should not leave.

Is it \r\n    permissible for him to do this? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: Yes, this is a legitimate excuse. If he has \r\n    severe halitosis that smells bad and he cannot remove it, then he is \r\n    excused. Similarly, onions or leeks are an excuse. But if there is any \r\n    remedy or a way to remove the smell, then he must do that, so that he will \r\n    not stay away from Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer and prayers in congregation.

So it \r\n    is better to avoid that, unless it is some minor matter that will not \r\n    distract him, so perhaps there is nothing wrong with it, because Allah, may \r\n    He be glorified and exalted, only spoke about the issue of Jumu&lsquo;ah, because \r\n    it is very important and it is obligatory to attend it, and one misses out \r\n    by missing it.

Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;When he enters the mosque, he is in a state of prayer so long as the prayer \r\n    is what is keeping him there, and the angels send blessings on any one of \r\n    you so long as he remains in the place where he prayed, saying, &lsquo;O Allaah, \r\n    forgive him, O Allaah, have mercy on him&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (477) \r\n    and Muslim (649).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It also brings the virtue of praying in the first row, and of \r\n    saying Ameen with the imam. It says in the saheeh hadeeth: &ldquo;When the imam \r\n    says &lsquo;Ameen&rsquo; then say &lsquo;Ameen,&rsquo; for if a person&rsquo;s saying Ameen coincides with \r\n    that of the angels, his previous sins will be forgiven.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (780) and Muslim (410). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who comes early to pray in congregation can also make \r\n    good use of the time between the adhaan and iqaamah by offering regular \r\n    Sunnah prayers or praying tahiyat al-masjid (two rak&rsquo;ahs to greet the \r\n    mosque), and he can spend the time in saying du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and seeking the good of \r\n    this world and the Hereafter, because the time between the adhaan and the \r\n    iqaaamah is one of the times when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are answered.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the practice of the salaf there are examples which stir \r\n    the heart and make one resolute, and call everyone who is negligent or \r\n    falling short to feel shy before the Lord of the Worlds, as righteous people \r\n    are competing to attain reward whilst he is negligent about reward. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Shaheen narrated in his book <i>al-Targheeb fi Fadaa&rsquo;il \r\n    al-A&rsquo;maal wa Thawaab dhaalika<\/i> (no. 107) from al-Hasan that Anas (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The companions of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him), including Hudhayfah, gathered together and a man said: \r\n    I would not like to miss the first takbeer with the imam even if I were to \r\n    have fifty sheep.

This is based on the following evidence:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him \r\n    as much as you can&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Taghaabun 64:16]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; And He says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond his \r\n    scope&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:286]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; And He says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;No blame or sin is there upon the blind, \r\n    nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Fath 48:17]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If I command you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; And when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) fell sick, he did not attend prayers in congregation, even though his house was beside the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood said: &ldquo;There was a time when \r\n    no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick&hellip;&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 654&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>All of this evidence indicates that the sick \r\n    person is spared the obligation to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah and prayers in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>See <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/438.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is obligatory for Muslim men to pray in the mosque and increase the numbers of the Muslims, \r\n    and to go out to the mosques (to pray), otherwise they will be resembling the hypocrites.

Every worshipper has to make sure he faces the qiblah in his \r\n      prayer, and strive to make sure he is facing in the right direction, \r\n      whether by means of natural signs or using a compass, if he is able to do \r\n      that, or by asking trustworthy people in that place who know in which \r\n      direction the qiblah is.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It seems most likely in the case that you describe that the \r\n    deviation from the qiblah was very slight. This slight deviation is \r\n    something that can happen when a person who lives in that area is a little \r\n    confused and people do not pay attention to this slight difference in \r\n    direction. If that is the case, i.e., if the deviation from the qiblah was \r\n    slight, then it does not matter and it does not invalidate the prayer, \r\n    because those who are far away from the Ka&rsquo;bah have to face in its general \r\n    direction; they do not have to face precisely in that direction, because \r\n    al-Tirmidhi (342) and Ibn Maajah (1011) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whatever is between the east and the \r\n    west is the qiblah.&rdquo; Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>al-Irwa&rsquo;<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-San&rsquo;aani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Subul \r\n    al-Salaam<\/i> (1\/260). This hadeeth indicates that what is required is to \r\n    face in that direction, and not towards the precise location of the Ka&rsquo;bah \r\n    when one cannot see it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Further evidence to this effect is to be seen in the report \r\n    narrated by al-Bukhaari (144) and Muslim (264) from Abu Ayyoob (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If you need to relieve yourself, then do not face \r\n    the qiblah or turn your back towards it, whether you are urinating or \r\n    defecating, rather face to the east or to the west.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    Sharh al-&lsquo;Umdah<\/i>: This is stating that facing any direction other than \r\n    the east or the west means that one is either facing the qiblah or turning \r\n    one&rsquo;s back towards it. This was addressed to the people of Madeenah and \r\n    everyone who was in the same direction (in relation to Makkah), because this \r\n    was the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). &lsquo;Umar \r\n    said: Whatever is between the east and the west is the qiblah except at the \r\n    House.&nbsp; And it was narrated that &lsquo;Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    said: How can a man make a mistake in his prayer when whatever is between \r\n    the east and the west is the qiblah, so long he does not turn towards the \r\n    east deliberately.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    Thus we know that the matter is broad in scope. So if we see a person \r\n    praying in a direction that is slightly off from the qiblah, that does not \r\n    matter, because he is facing in its general direction, and this is what he \r\n    is obliged to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/273&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if the deviation from \r\n    the direction of the qiblah was very great, so that you were not praying in \r\n    the direction of the qiblah at all, such as if you were praying towards the \r\n    east when the qiblah is towards the west or the north, for example, so long \r\n    as you based your action on the words of someone who you know attaches great \r\n    importance to the prayer and you thought that they knew better about the \r\n    direction of the qiblah, then you do not have to do anything, and the \r\n    prayers which you offered are still valid, even if you faced the wrong \r\n    direction when you prayed, because if a person tries his best to get it \r\n    right, he has done what is required of him, as Allaah says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you \r\n    can&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Taghaabun 64:16]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>Fataawa \r\n    al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (6\/314): If a worshipper does his best to figure \r\n    out the direction of the qiblah and prays, then he finds out that he was \r\n    mistaken, his prayer is still valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) (10\/421) it says: If a believer does his best to figure out the \r\n    direction of the qiblah, when he is in the desert or is in a city in which \r\n    he is not sure where the qiblah is, and he prays on that basis, then he \r\n    finds out that he prayed in a direction other than the qiblah, then he \r\n    should continue to pray according to his latest estimate, if he believes \r\n    that it is more correct than his first estimate.

Although the Friday khutbah does not absolutely have to be in \r\n    Arabic, this ritual is of great importance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The non-Arabs who entered \r\n    Islam in the early period hastened to learn Arabic in order to understand \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and to form bonds through the language without which \r\n    the unity of the ummah cannot be achieved. The Sahaabah used to address the \r\n    people in Arabic in every land that they conquered, and it was not long \r\n    before the language of the lands that they entered became Arabic, due to the \r\n    influence of the spirit of Islam, not for worldly gains or by force of \r\n    compulsion. If they had thought that it was acceptable to leave the non-Arab \r\n    nations who entered their religion with their own languages, they would have \r\n    hastened to learn the languages of those nations and established the \r\n    religious obligations and acts of worship for them in those languages, and \r\n    Greek would have remained Greek, Persian would have remained Persian, and so \r\n    on. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The difference in languages \r\n    that we see today among Muslims is one of the most serious bad effects of \r\n    politics.

We cannot \r\n    rely on any religious reform in India or elsewhere in the Muslim world, \r\n    unless Arabic is taught from the primary stage and is made the language of \r\n    knowledge.

Hence Imam al-Nawawi included it in a chapter in <i>Saheeh \r\n    Muslim<\/i> (2\/587) entitled &ldquo;Chapter: Praying Jumu&lsquo;ah when the sun has \r\n    passed the meridian.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to the hadeeth of Salamah quoted above under \r\n    the first view: that was when the sun had passed the meridian.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The response to their quoting the hadeeth of Jaabir and \r\n    others as evidence is that all of these reports may be referring to how \r\n    early it used to be done and how important it is to hasten to do it after \r\n    the sun has passed the meridian, without waiting for the heat to abate and \r\n    so on. This is a summary of the interpretation of the scholars for these \r\n    hadeeths. And the action of all Muslims is that they do not pray Jumu &lsquo;ah \r\n    until after the sun has passed the meridian. In more detail, the answer is \r\n    as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the hadeeth of Jaabir it states that the prayer and \r\n    letting their camels rest came when the sun passed the meridian, not that \r\n    the prayer came before it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The response to the hadeeth of Salamah is that it offers us \r\n    proof that the prayer came after the sun had passed the meridian, because it \r\n    does not mean that the walls offered no shade; rather what it means is that \r\n    there was not enough shade for a passer-by to seek shade.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And clearer than that is the other report, &ldquo;[we would] try to \r\n    seek shade&rdquo;. This clearly states that there was shade, but it was little. It \r\n    is well known that their walls were low and their land was closer to the \r\n    equator, and there was no shade in which shade could be sought until a long \r\n    time after the sun had passed the meridian.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the hadeeth of Sahl, &ldquo;We used not to take a \r\n    nap or eat lunch until after Jumu&lsquo;ah&rdquo;, what it means is that they used to \r\n    delay taking a nap and eating lunch on this day until after Jumu&lsquo;ah prayer, \r\n    because they were recommended to come early to the prayer; if they had \r\n    gotten busy with any of these things before the prayer, they would have \r\n    feared missing the prayer or missing out on coming early to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is supported by the report narrated by Maalik in <i>\r\n    al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i>, with his saheeh isnaad from &lsquo;Umar ibn Abi Sahl ibn Maalik, \r\n    from his father who said: I saw a velvet carpet belonging to &lsquo;Aqeel ibn Abi \r\n    Taalib put out next to the western wall of the mosque on a Friday, and when \r\n    the carpet was fully in the shade of the wall, &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with him) would come out of the mosque and they would come \r\n    out after Friday prayer and take the nap that we usually took before noon. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Majmoo&lsquo;<\/i>, 4\/511-512&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most correct view is that of the majority of scholars, \r\n    that the time for Jumu&lsquo;ah is the same as the time for Zuhr, and undoubtedly \r\n    this is more on the safe side.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best time (for Jumu&lsquo;ah) is after the sun has passed the \r\n    meridian, so as to avoid an area of scholarly dispute, because most of the \r\n    scholars say that it is essential for Jumu&lsquo;ah prayer to be after the sun \r\n    passes the meridian. This is the view of the majority.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some scholars are of the view that it is permissible to pray \r\n    Jumu&lsquo;ah before the sun passes the meridian in the sixth hour, and there are \r\n    hadeeths and reports indicating that which are saheeh. So if a person prays \r\n    Jumu&lsquo;ah shortly before the sun passes the meridian, his prayer is valid. But \r\n    it should only be done after the sun passes the meridian, following all of \r\n    the hadeeths and so as to avoid an area of scholarly dispute, and so as to \r\n    make it easy for all people to attend together, and so that the prayer will \r\n    be at the same time. This is what is better and more on the safe side. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    12\/391-392&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5785","question_id":"5785","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslims in general should respect the Sunnah of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and strive to learn \r\n    it and act upon it, because this is a sign of their sincere love for Allaah \r\n    and a means of them attaining Allaah&rsquo;s love for them.

Travellers and desert dwellers should \r\n    also pray Zuhr, as is indicated by the Sunnah, because during the Farewell \r\n    Pilgrimage, when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) stood at &lsquo;Arafah on a Friday he led the people in praying Zuhr and he \r\n    did not lead them in praying Jumu&rsquo;ah, because he did not order the people of \r\n    the desert (people who live outside cities and towns) to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of the majority of scholars, and the view of \r\n    those who held odd opinions should not be taken into account. The one who \r\n    misses Jumu&rsquo;ah deliberately also has to repent to Allaah and offer it as \r\n    Zuhr prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&rsquo;ah li Samaahat \r\n    al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> (may Allaah have mercy on him) (12\/332).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the view of Shaykh Naasir al-Albaani (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him), it is in accordance with the view of the majority of scholars \r\n    on this matter. In his essay al-Ajwabah al-Naafi&rsquo;ah (p. 47) he quotes the \r\n    words of Siddeeq Hasan Khan: Jumu&rsquo;ah is an obligation that Allaah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, has enjoined upon His slaves. If a person misses it \r\n    for some reason, there should be evidence that Zuhr prayer is required. The \r\n    hadeeth of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, &ldquo;If you miss the two rak&rsquo;ahs then you should pray \r\n    four rak&rsquo;ahs&rdquo; indicates that the one who misses Jumu&rsquo;ah must pray Zuhr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then al-Albaani commented on these words by agreeing with \r\n    them and classing the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) as saheeh. Among the things that he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said \r\n    was:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps the author quoted the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood as \r\n    evidence even though it is mawqoof because he did not know of anyone among \r\n    the Sahaabah who disagreed with that. It is supported by the meaning that is \r\n    understood from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: &ldquo;Whoever catches up with one \r\n    rak&rsquo;ah of Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer has caught up with Jumu&rsquo;ah.&rdquo; It is also supported \r\n    by the report narrated in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i> (1\/206\/1) with a saheeh isnaad \r\n    from &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Dhu&rsquo;ayb who said: I went out with al-Zubayr on \r\n    a Friday and he prayed Jumu&rsquo;ah with four rak&rsquo;ahs. This &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan is \r\n    the son of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Dhu&rsquo;ayb who was mentioned by Ibn Hibbaan in\r\n    <i>al-Thiqaat<\/i> (6\/122\/1) who said: He was an orphan who was under the \r\n    care of al-Zubayr ibn al-&lsquo;Awwaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The hadeeth of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood indicates that Zuhr is the basic \r\n    obligation, and that it is what is required of the one who does not pray \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah. This is supported by several things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; It is well known that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions used to pray Zuhr on \r\n    Fridays if they were travelling, but they would offer it in shortened form.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the basic obligation on Friday was Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer, they \r\n    would have offered the two rak&rsquo;ahs as Jumu&rsquo;ah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ma&rsquo;daan narrated that his grandmother \r\n    said: &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood said to us (women): When you pray with the \r\n    imam on Friday, pray as he prays, but if you pray in your houses, then pray \r\n    four rak&rsquo;ahs.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (1\/207\/2). Its isnaad going back \r\n    to the grandmother of Ibn Ma&rsquo;daan is saheeh, but who she is I do not know. \r\n    It seems that she was a Taabi&rsquo;i woman, not one of the Sahaabah, but (this \r\n    report) is supported by what al-Hasan said, that a woman who attends the \r\n    mosque on a Friday should pray with the imam, and that will be sufficient \r\n    for her. Its isnaad is saheeh in the report via Ash&rsquo;ath from al-Hasan who \r\n    said: The women of the Muhaajireen used to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah with the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they \r\n    regarded that as sufficient and did not think that they had to pray Zuhr as \r\n    well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I said: The one who claims that the basic obligation on \r\n    Friday is Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer, and that the one who misses it or is not obliged \r\n    to pray it, such as travellers and women, should pray two rak&rsquo;ahs of \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah, has gone against these texts with no evidence. Then I saw that \r\n    al-San&rsquo;aani (2\/74) stated something similar and that if a person misses \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah he must pray Zuhr according to scholarly consensus, and (Zuhr) is a \r\n    replacement for (Jumu&rsquo;ah). End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, with regard to women, the scholars are unanimously \r\n    agreed that Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer is not obligatory for women and that they may \r\n    pray Zuhr in their homes with four rak&rsquo;ahs on Fridays.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Ijmaa&rsquo;<\/i> (no. 52): They are unanimously agreed that Jumu&rsquo;ah is not \r\n    obligatory for women. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Taariq ibn Shihaab \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Jumu&rsquo;ah is a duty that is \r\n    required of every Muslim in congregation except four: a slave, a woman, a \r\n    child or a sick person.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood (1067). Al-Nawawi said in <i>\r\n    al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (4\/483): Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of \r\n    the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Ibn Rajab said in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> \r\n    (5\/327): Its isnaad is saheeh. Ibn Katheer said in <i>Irshaad al-Faqeeh<\/i> \r\n    (1\/190): Its isnaad is jayyid. It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n    in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i> (3111).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information on this topic, please see question no. \r\n    [fatin]73339[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5788","question_id":"5788","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The difference among the \r\n    Muslims with regard to determining the&nbsp; first day of Ramadaan and the time \r\n    for Eid al-Fitr stems from the differences of opinion among the fuqaha&rsquo; \r\n    concerning the well known issue, which is whether sighting of the new moon \r\n    in one country becomes binding for all other countries, or should each \r\n    country have its own sighting.

He was asked: What is the ruling on residents \r\n    and travellers doing tawaaf when the khateeb is delivering the khutbah on \r\n    Friday?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: Once the khateeb begins his khutbah, the \r\n    worshippers must listen attentively to the khutbah and stay where they are, \r\n    and it is not permissible to busy oneself with something other than that, \r\n    except for one who comes in during the khutbah, who may pray two rak&rsquo;ahs but \r\n    he should make them short, whether he is one of the people of Makkah or not. \r\n    The evidence that it is forbidden to move and speak during the khutbah is \r\n    general in meaning, to such an extent that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If you say to your companion, \r\n    &lsquo;Listen attentively&rsquo; when the imam is delivering the khutbah, then you have \r\n    engaged in idle speech.&rdquo; Thus he warned against asking someone to be quiet \r\n    even though it is done for the right reason. Based on this, we think that it \r\n    is not permissible to do tawaaf at all so long as the imam is delivering the \r\n    Friday khutbah. The imams of old forbade doing tawaaf during the khutbah, \r\n    but the later imams were more lenient and claimed that they could not \r\n    prevent those people who were doing tawaaf and those who gave the reason \r\n    that they were travelling and were bidding farewell to the Ka&rsquo;bah in this \r\n    tawaaf, or who think that tawaaf is superior to listening attentively to the \r\n    khutbah. But this is not correct, and we think that they should be prevented \r\n    until the Friday prayer is over. With regard to the Eid khutbah, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with doing tawaaf during this khutbah, because it is sunnah, \r\n    and the worshippers are not obliged to stay until it ends. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majallat al-Haras al-Watani<\/i>, issue no. \r\n    272, dated 1\/1\/2005.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5794","question_id":"5794","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Those who \r\n    attend Friday prayers should focus fully on the khutbah.

Whoever comes at the fifth hour, it is as if he sacrificed an egg. \r\n    Then when the imam comes out, the angels come in to listen to the reminder \r\n    (khutbah).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 841; Muslim, 850&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars differed as to the definition of these hours. \r\n    There are three opinions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That they start when dawn breaks<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That they start when the sun rises. This is the view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ahmad, and others.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; That these &lsquo;hours&rsquo; all fall within one period of time, \r\n    which is after the sun has passed its zenith. This is the view of Maalik, \r\n    and was favoured by some of the Shaafa&rsquo;is.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third view is weak, and was refuted by many.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is well known that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) used to go out to offer the Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer straight \r\n    after the sun passed its zenith, as do all imams in all regions. That is \r\n    after the end of the sixth hour, which indicates that the one who comes \r\n    after the sun has passed its zenith has no share of guidance and virtue, and \r\n    no reward will be recorded for him at all, because he has come after the \r\n    scrolls (of the recording angels) have been rolled up. The mention of these \r\n    hours is intended only to encourage people to come early and attain the \r\n    reward of being in the first row and waiting for the prayer, and keeping \r\n    busy with naafil prayers, dhikr and the like. None of that can be achieved \r\n    by going to the mosque after the sun has passed its zenith, and there is no \r\n    virtue in doing so, because the call to prayer is given at that time and it \r\n    is haraam to delay responding to it.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah early, and \r\n    when the imam comes out the scrolls (of the recording angels) are rolled up, \r\n    and no reward is written down for the one who comes to Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer after \r\n    that, so what virtue can there be in such a person? End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/73&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The correct view is the \r\n    second one, which says that these hours begin when the sun rises, and the \r\n    time between sunrise and the second adhaan should be divided into five \r\n    parts, of which each one is what is meant by the word saa&rsquo;ah (lit. &ldquo;hour&rdquo;) \r\n    in the hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When does the first hour of Friday begin?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;The hours which were mentioned by the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are five. He said: &ldquo;Whoever comes (to \r\n    the mosque) in the first hour, it is as if he sacrificed a camel. Whoever \r\n    comes at the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow. Whoever comes at \r\n    the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram. Whoever comes at the \r\n    fourth hour, it is as if he sacrificed a chicken. Whoever comes at the fifth \r\n    hour, it is as if he sacrificed an egg. Then when the imam comes out, the \r\n    angels come in to listen to the reminder (khutbah).&rdquo; So the time between \r\n    sunrise and the imam&rsquo;s arrival is divided into five parts, each of which may \r\n    be equivalent to what we know as an hour (sixty minutes), or it may be more \r\n    or less, because time changes. So there are five hours between sunrise and \r\n    the imam&rsquo;s arrival for the prayer, starting at sunrise. It was also said \r\n    that it begins at the break of dawn, but the first view is more correct, \r\n    because the time before sunrise is the time for Fajr prayer.

Rather what you have to do is to pray \r\n    Zuhr, because you are more akin to travellers and those who live in the \r\n    desert. Jumu&rsquo;ah is only obligatory for permanent residents. The evidence for \r\n    that is the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) did not command travellers or those living in the desert to pray \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah, and he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do \r\n    that when he was travelling, and neither did his companions (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with them). It is proven in the saheeh ahaadeeth that during the \r\n    Farewell Pilgrimage the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) prayed Zuhr in &lsquo;Arafah on a Friday; he did not pray Jumu&rsquo;ah or command \r\n    the pilgrims to do so, because they came under the ruling on travellers. I \r\n    do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars of Islam regarding \r\n    this matter, praise be to Allaah, apart from some odd views among some of \r\n    the Taabi&rsquo;een, with which we need not concern ourselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if there are some permanent Muslim residents who pray \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah there, then it is prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah for you and others like \r\n    you who are staying in that place temporarily in order to seek knowledge, do \r\n    business, etc, to pray with them so that you may attain the virtue of \r\n    praying Jumu&rsquo;ah.

The workers may rest assured that there is no sin on them if they \r\n    stay on the farm and pray Zuhr.

Thus we should understand these reports in this manner, in order \r\n    to reconcile the reports.

As this is the case, everything that comes under \r\n    the heading of enjoining what is good comes under the same ruling as \r\n    enjoining what is good &ndash; so how about if it of less importance than that? \r\n    Undoubtedly in that case it is more appropriate that it not be allowed and \r\n    it comes under the heading of laghw (idle talk).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Ajwabah al-Naafi&rsquo;ah<\/i>, p. 45&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Conclusion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who attend Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers have to be silent and listen \r\n    attentively to the imam.

It states that the time for Zuhr is from when the sun passes its \r\n    zenith until the shadow of an object is equal in length to it; the time for \r\n    &lsquo;Asr is from when the shadow of an object is equal in length to it until the \r\n    sun sets, but once the sun starts to turn yellow,\r\n    <span>\r\n    this is the time of necessity<\/span>; the time for Maghrib lasts from when \r\n    the sun sets until the red afterglow disappears; the time for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; is from \r\n    when the red afterglow has disappeared until halfway through the night; and \r\n    the time for Fajr is from when dawn begins until the sun rises.

He was \r\n    asked about that and he said that he did not want to make things difficult \r\n    for his ummah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There was heavy rainfall that caused hardship at the time of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but he did not \r\n    combine &lsquo;Asr with Jumu&rsquo;ah at that time. It is narrated in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Bukhaari<\/i> and elsewhere from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed for rain one day when he \r\n    was on the minbar, and he did not descend from the minbar until rain had \r\n    soaked his beard. Such a thing could not happen except in the case of heavy \r\n    rain that would have allowed him to combine the prayers, if it were \r\n    permissible to combine &lsquo;Asr with Jumu&rsquo;ah. He (Anas) said: The following \r\n    Friday, a man came in and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, our wealth has been \r\n    drowned and our buildings have been destroyed; pray to Allaah to withhold it \r\n    from us.&rdquo; This implies that water was flowing in the streets, in such a way \r\n    that it would have allowed them to combine &lsquo;Asr with Jumu&rsquo;ah, if this \r\n    combination were permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If someone were to ask: what is the evidence that it is not \r\n    allowed to combine &lsquo;Asr with Jumu&rsquo;ah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that this question is not appropriate, because \r\n    the basic principle concerning acts of worship is that they should not be \r\n    done unless there is evidence that they should be done. So we should not \r\n    question the one who is not doing a certain act of worship about his \r\n    evidence, rather the one who is doing a certain act of worship should be \r\n    asked for his evidence, because Allaah says, denouncing those who worship \r\n    Allaah in ways that are not prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods) who have \r\n    instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not ordained?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Shoora 42:21]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;This day, I have \r\n    perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have \r\n    chosen for you Islam as your religion&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:3]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours \r\n    (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If someone says: what is the evidence that it is not allowed \r\n    to combine &lsquo;Asr with Jumu&rsquo;ah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We say: What is the evidence that it is permitted? The basic \r\n    principle is that it is obligatory to offer &lsquo;Asr on time; this principle may \r\n    be waived when it is combined with another prayer when there is a reason for \r\n    doing so, but at other times the principle still stands, which is that it \r\n    should not be offered ahead of time. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said: What do you think if a person intends Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    prayer as Zuhr so that he can combine &lsquo;Asr with it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that if the one who is leading Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer \r\n    and the people behind him do this, i.e., if the people of a town intend \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer as Zuhr, then there is no doubt that this is haraam and the \r\n    prayer is invalid, because Jumu&rsquo;ah is obligatory for them, and if they \r\n    ignore it and pray Zuhr instead, then they have turned away from something \r\n    that is enjoined upon them towards something that they are not commanded to \r\n    do. So their action is invalid and rejected, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is \r\n    not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the person who intends Jumu&rsquo;ah as Zuhr is someone like \r\n    a traveler who prays behind those who are praying Jumu&rsquo;ah but intends it as \r\n    Zuhr so that he can combine &lsquo;Asr with it, this is not valid either, because \r\n    when he attended Jumu&rsquo;ah, it became obligatory for him, and whoever is \r\n    obliged to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah but prays Zuhr before the imam says the salaam at \r\n    the end of Jumu&rsquo;ah, his Zuhr prayer is not valid. Even if this action was \r\n    valid, he has still missed out on a great deal of good, which is the reward \r\n    for Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The authors of <i>al-Muntaha<\/i> and <i>al-Iqnaa&rsquo;<\/i> (who \r\n    are Hanbali scholars) have stated that it is not valid to combine &lsquo;Asr with \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah; this is mentioned at the beginning of the chapters on Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I have spoken about this \r\n    matter at length because of the need for that.

So they blocked the way that leads to division and put an end to the aims of those who follow their evil whims and desires, by \r\n    saying that no one should offer an obligatory prayer in congregation in a mosque when the prayer has already been offered in jamaa&rsquo;ah with a \r\n    regular imam or any other imam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The first opinion is the one which is \r\n    correct, because of what we have said above about the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him \r\n    as much as you can&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Taghaabun 64:16]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;When I command you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Undoubtedly praying in congregation is part \r\n    of fearing Allaah (taqwa) and is one of the things enjoined by sharee&rsquo;ah, so we should strive to do it as much as we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not right to contradict a sound \r\n    narration with the opinions of some scholars who based their view repeating the jamaa&rsquo;ah in the mosque as makrooh on their own rational thinking. \r\n    Rather we should do that which is indicated by the saheeh reports.

Thus the way to division will be barred and the aims of \r\n    those who follow their whims and desires will be thwarted whilst also following the evidence which says that those who missed the first jamaa&rsquo;ah \r\n    should pray in another jamaa&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.

It is agreed (among the scholars) that this is makrooh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He also said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The scholars said that the reason why it is forbidden to single out Friday for fasting is that \r\n    Friday is a day of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, dhikr and worship, such as ghusl, going early to the prayer, waiting for the prayer, listening to the khutbah and \r\n    reciting a lot of dhikr afterwards, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Then when the (Jumu&lsquo;ah) Salaah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and \r\n    seek the Bounty of Allaah (by working), and remember Allaah much&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Jumu&rsquo;ah 62:10]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And there are other acts of worship to be done on this day. So it is preferable not to fast \r\n    then, as this will help a person to perform these duties in an energetic manner and enjoy them without feeling bored or tired. This is like the \r\n    pilgrim on the day of &lsquo;Arafah in &lsquo;Arafah, because the Sunnah is for him not to fast on that day for the same reason&hellip; This is the reason for not \r\n    allowing singling out Friday for&nbsp; fasting. And it was said that the reason is so that people will not go to extremes in venerating it as happened \r\n    in the case of Saturday. But this view is weak, because on that day we offer Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer and do other acts of worship which are a kind of \r\n    veneration. And it was said that the reason for its prohibition is so that people would not think that this was obligatory. This is also a weak \r\n    view because it is encouraged to fast on Mondays and there was no fear that anyone would think it was obligatory. No attention should be paid to \r\n    this far-fetched view. The same argument is applicable in the case of fasting the day of &lsquo;Arafah and the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, etc. The correct view \r\n    is that which we have stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5807","question_id":"5807","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has enjoined Jumu&rsquo;ah upon the Muslims who are settled \r\n    in a city or village, and He has forbidden them to become distracted from \r\n    that by buying and selling, etc, because of the general meaning of the verse \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe (Muslims)!

If the Muslims do that, then there is no other obligation \r\n          upon them, be it Zuhr or any other prayer. Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer is the obligation \r\n          of that time. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), his companions (may Allaah \r\n          be pleased with them), and the righteous salaf who came after them, \r\n          did not pray any other obligatory prayer after Jumu&rsquo;ah. The action to \r\n          which you refer was introduced many centuries later, and undoubtedly \r\n          it is one of the newly-invented innovations of which the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Beware of newly-invented \r\n          matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every \r\n          innovation is a going astray.&rdquo; (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3991)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>And he \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever innovates \r\n          something in this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it will \r\n          have it rejected.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Undoubtedly \r\n          praying Zuhr after Jumu&rsquo;ah is something innovated which is not a part \r\n          of the matter of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so it is to be rejected \r\n          and is to be included in the innovations and misguidance against which \r\n          the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us. The scholars \r\n          have drawn attention to that, including Shaykh Jamaal al-Deen al-Qaasimi, \r\n          in his book <i>Islaah al-Masaajid min al-Bida&rsquo; wa&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Awaa&rsquo;id<\/i> and \r\n          Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad &lsquo;Abd al-Salaam in his book <i>al-Sunan wa&rsquo;l-Mubtada&rsquo;aat<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          If someone were to say, &ldquo;We only do that in order to \r\n          be on the safe side, lest our Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer was not valid,&rdquo; our answer \r\n          is that he should be told that the basic principle is that the Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n          prayer is valid and is sound and that it is not obligatory to pray Zuhr, \r\n          indeed it is not permissible to do so at the time of Jumu&rsquo;ah for those \r\n          for whom Jumu&rsquo;ah is obligatory. Being on the safe side is prescribed \r\n          in cases where the way of the Sunnah is not clear, and there is some \r\n          doubt and uncertainty. But in a case such as this it is not the matter \r\n          of doubt; rather we know from the evidence that what is obligatory is \r\n          Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer only, so it is not permissible to do something else instead \r\n          or in addition to it on the grounds that this is an action with the \r\n          intention of being on the safe side, or to institute a new way which \r\n          Allaah has not prescribed. Praying Zuhr at this time is contrary to \r\n          the shar&rsquo;i evidence which is well established and no Muslim has any \r\n          excuse for not knowing, so we must not do this and we must beware of \r\n          it. There are no grounds for doing this, rather it comes from the waswaas \r\n          (insinuating whispers) of the Shaytaan which he whispers to people so \r\n          as to prevent them from following true guidance and institutes for them \r\n          a religion which Allaah has not allowed. This is similar to the way \r\n          in which he makes the idea of &ldquo;being on the safe side&rdquo; when doing wudoo&rsquo; \r\n          attractive to them, until he makes wudoo&rsquo; a torment for them, and it \r\n          takes all their time; whenever they have almost finished, he whispers \r\n          to them&nbsp; that they have not done it properly or they have not done \r\n          such and such. He does the same thing to some of them in the prayer; \r\n          when a person says takbeer for the prayer, he whispers to him that he \r\n          did not say the takbeer, and he keeps whispering to him that he did \r\n          not say takbeer, and the person keeps on saying takbeer after takbeer, \r\n          until the first rak&rsquo;ah is over, or until the recitation or most of it \r\n          is over. This is one of the traps and snares of the Shaytaan, who is \r\n          keen to annul the good deeds of the Muslim and make him confused about \r\n          his religion. We ask Allaah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and \r\n          sound from his traps, snares and insinuating whispers, for He is the \r\n          All-Hearing, Ever-Near.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Conclusion:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Praying Zuhr after Jumu&rsquo;ah is a bid&rsquo;ah and a going astray, \r\n          instituting a new way which Allaah has not prescribed. We must not do \r\n          this; we must beware of it and warn people against it, and limit ourselves \r\n          to doing Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer only, as was the way of the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), his companions after him \r\n          and those who have followed them in truth until the present day. This \r\n          is the truth concerning which there is no doubt. Imaam Maalik ibn Anas \r\n          (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;The later generations of this \r\n          ummah will not be reformed by anything except that by which the first \r\n          generation was reformed.&rdquo; This was also the view of other imaams after \r\n          him.

But if you do not come until after the salaam or \r\n          after the second rak&rsquo;ah, during the Tashahhud or when the imaam is prostrating \r\n          in the second rak&rsquo;ah, then you should not pray it as Jumu&rsquo;ah, but rather \r\n          as Zuhr, because the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever catches up \r\n          with one rak&rsquo;ah of Jumu&rsquo;ah, let him add one more to it and his prayer \r\n          will be complete.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 482; al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 554; Ibn \r\n          Maajah, 1113). The meaning of this hadeeth is that if he only catches \r\n          up with less than a rak&rsquo;ah then he has not caught up with Jumu&rsquo;ah so \r\n          he has to pray it as Zuhr. This is what is prescribed in Islam. If he \r\n          catches up with a person who is making up the rak&rsquo;ah that he missed, \r\n          and prays with him, then he should pray it as Zuhr and not as Jumu&rsquo;ah. \r\n          It should also be noted that this should be after the sun has passed \r\n          its zenith. But if Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer was offered before the sun reached \r\n          its zenith, he should not pray Zuhr until after the sun has passed its \r\n          zenith, because it is permissible to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah before the sun reaches \r\n          its zenith, in the &ldquo;sixth hour&rdquo;, according to the correct scholarly \r\n          view. But it is preferable and more on the safe side to pray it after \r\n          the sun has passed its zenith, as is the view of the majority of scholars. \r\n          But in the case of Zuhr, it is not permissible to pray it until after \r\n          the sun has passed its zenith, according to the consensus of the Muslims. \r\n          And Allaah is the Source of Strength.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&rsquo;ah li Samahat al-Shaykh al-&lsquo;Allaamah &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), part 12, p. 329"},{"id":"5825","question_id":"5825","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise\r\n      be to Allaah.<o> <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <h1>It is \r\n      permissible to speak during the interval when the imaam falls silent \r\n      between the two khutbahs, if there is a need to do so.

During the part\r\n    of the (congregational) prayer he caught up with, he was subject to the rulings concerning\r\n    one who prays in congregation behind an imaam.

The person who joined the\r\n    prayer late is like the person who is praying individually, so he should not recite aloud.\r\n    But the person who joins the Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer late is considered to have prayed\r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah in essence, because he followed the imaam, and different conditions apply to\r\n    the one who follows than to the one who leads, with regard to numbers and so on.

This is the view of Ibn Hazm. <i>Al-Muhalla<\/i>, 5\/97,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not sufficient in the khutbah to discourage people from \r\n    being attached to worldly matters and to remind them of death, rather it is \r\n    essential to give what may be called a khutbah according to custom, and that \r\n    cannot be achieved by means of an abbreviated speech that fails to fulfil \r\n    the purpose. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i>, p. 79&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa&rsquo;di (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo;s stipulation of the four essential parts in each \r\n    of the two khutbahs is subject to further discussion. If the speaker does in \r\n    each of the two khutbahs that which fulfils the purpose of the khutbah, \r\n    which is exhortation that moves the heart, then he has done the khutbah. But \r\n    undoubtedly praise of Allaah, blessings upon the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) and recitation of some Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    are all things which complete and adorn the khutbah. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Fataawa al-Sa&rsquo;diyyah<\/i>, p. 193&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The khateeb should be pure and free of impurities both minor \r\n    and major, and he should wear his best clothes, greet the people with salaam \r\n    and deliver the khutbah from the minbar. He should turn to face the people \r\n    and he should be sincere in exhorting and reminding the people in clear and \r\n    eloquent words. He should keep the khutbah short and not make it lengthy, \r\n    and he should make it into two khutbahs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are differences of opinion with regard to many of these \r\n    minor issues, the details of which are discussed elsewhere. But here we have \r\n    limited it to an overall discussion of that which all the Muslims need to \r\n    know.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    However we should point out here the importance of paying \r\n    attention to the people's situation with regard to what the khutbah should \r\n    contain. The khateeb should give them what they need and not talk to them \r\n    about things that they cannot understand or that they do not need to know of \r\n    religious issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover he should not differ from what people are used to in \r\n    their khutbahs of remembrance of Allaah, supplication or other things that \r\n    are mustahabb in the khutbah, and for which there is no evidence that they \r\n    are essential in the khutbah. It is sufficient for there to be evidence that \r\n    they are mustahabb or even allowed for him to do them. And he should pay \r\n    attention to the people's situation and needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    after discussing what the Hanbali fuqaha&rsquo; regard as essential in the Friday \r\n    khutbah: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars said that the basic condition of the \r\n    khutbah is that it should contain exhortation that softens the hearts and is \r\n    beneficial to the people present, and that praising Allaah, sending \r\n    blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) and \r\n    reciting a verse are all part of perfecting the khutbah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But this opinion, although it carries some weight, need not \r\n    be followed if the people of this city follow the first view which the \r\n    author mentioned above, because if he omits these conditions which the \r\n    author has mentioned, the people will become confused and everyone will \r\n    leave Jumu&rsquo;ah feeling that he has not prayed Jumu&rsquo;ah, but if you fulfil \r\n    these conditions you will not be doing anything haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Paying attention to the people with regard to any matter that \r\n    is not haraam is the way of sharee&rsquo;ah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) paid attention to his Companions with regard to fasting \r\n    and not fasting in Ramadan when travelling, and he paid attention to them \r\n    with regard to the rebuilding of the Ka&rsquo;bah, when he said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah: \r\n    &ldquo;Were it not that your people are still new in Islam, I would have \r\n    demolished the Ka&rsquo;bah and rebuilt it on the foundations of Ibraaheem.&rdquo; \r\n    [Agreed upon] This principle is well known in sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you go along with them with regard to something that \r\n    is haraam, this is called compromise and it is not permissible. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;They wish that you should compromise \r\n    (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with \r\n    you&rdquo; [al-Qalam 68:9]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 5\/56&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5848","question_id":"5848","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      There is nothing wrong with the khateeb saying at the end \r\n      of his speech, &ldquo;Aqoolu haadha wa astaghfir-Allaah (I say this and I ask \r\n      Allah for forgiveness)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aqoolu qawli haadha wa astaghfir-Allaah (I say \r\n      these words of mine and I ask Allah for forgiveness)&rdquo;, whether this is the \r\n      first or second Friday khutbah or any other kind of speech.

By His power He made us kings and chose the best of His creation as \r\n    a Messenger, who is the most honourable in lineage, the most sincere in \r\n    speech, and the noblest in ancestry, and sent down to him His Book and \r\n    entrusted him (to guide) His creation. He was Allah's choice from among the \r\n    worlds.

We are Allah's helpers and the assistants of His \r\n    Messenger, and we will fight men until they believe in Allah.

Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s lengthening his prayer and shortening \r\n    his khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion),&rdquo; i.e., it is \r\n    indicative of his understanding of religion and shows that he pays attention \r\n    to people&rsquo;s circumstances.

In the answer referred to, Shaykh \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) supported this view, but he \r\n    pointed out that it should not be followed. Please see his words in that \r\n    answer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This khateeb whose khutbah \r\n    and prayer together take ten minutes does not have deep understanding of \r\n    Islam, rather he is ignorant, because understanding of the religion means \r\n    keeping the khutbah short and making the prayer long, not effectively \r\n    destroying them both! &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Let us read what the \r\n    Khateeb of al-Masjid al-Haraam, Shaykh Sa&rsquo;ood al-Shuraym, says concerning \r\n    the length of the Jumu&rsquo;ah khutbah and prayer, with approximate length of \r\n    time:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Sa&rsquo;ood al-Shuraym \r\n    (may Allaah preserve him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In order to reach an \r\n    approximate definition of what is meant by the prayer being long and the \r\n    khutbah being short in modern terms, I say &ndash; and Allaah is the source of \r\n    strength &ndash; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you recite in Fajr \r\n    prayer, for example, al-Jumu&rsquo;ah and al-Munaafiqoon at a moderate speed, the \r\n    prayer will take you no less than ten minutes, if not fifteen. I tried it \r\n    and I found that to be the case. All of this applies if you recite at a \r\n    moderate speed, with the rukoo&rsquo; (bowing) and sujood (prostration) of the \r\n    prayer. So how about if the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) was following the command of his Lord, <i>&ldquo;And recite the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style&rdquo; [al-Muzzammil 73:4]<\/i>, and \r\n    he used to make the bowing, rising, prostration and sitting between two \r\n    prostrations lengthy, and the narrator of the hadeeth said: &ldquo;to such an \r\n    extent that one would think he had forgotten&rdquo;? In the hadeeth of al-Bara&rsquo; \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him) it says: The prayer of the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his \r\n    bowing, and when he raised his head from bowing, and when he prostrated, and \r\n    the time between two prostrations were all nearly the same.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Al-Shaamil fi Fiqh \r\n    al-Khateeb wa&rsquo;l-Khutbah<\/i> (p. 154)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>From this it is clear that \r\n    it is not possible for this khateeb to deliver the Friday khutbah and offer \r\n    the Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer in ten minutes, unless there is clear undermining of both \r\n    matters, the khutbah and the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Such a person needs to be \r\n    told, because perhaps he may have misunderstood something from the Sunnah \r\n    with regard to this matter, so he is spoiling both the khutbah and the \r\n    prayer, whilst thinking that he is one of those who do good!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he does not respond to \r\n    your telling him, then look for someone else who establishes the Sunnah in a \r\n    proper way or close enough, and pray with him, and protect your prayer, and keep your heart sound.

In the four <i>Sunans<\/i> \r\n    it is narrated in the hadeeth of Abu&rsquo;l-Ja&lsquo;d ad-Dumari &ndash; who was a Companion \r\n    &ndash; that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever misses three Jumu&lsquo;ahs out of heedlessness, Allah will place a \r\n    seal on his heart.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, 1\/384-385.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet&rsquo;s Sunnah also singles out Jumu&lsquo;ah prayer by \r\n    encouraging believers to do ghusl for it and to wear perfume (for men only). \r\n    It is also strongly encouraged to come early for the prayer and there is a \r\n    great deal of reward for walking to the prayer. Concerning these special \r\n    characteristics, Sa&lsquo;eed ibn Mansoor narrated from Na&lsquo;eem ibn &lsquo;Abdullah \r\n    al-Mujammir that &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) issued \r\n    instructions that the mosque of Madinah be perfumed with incense every \r\n    Friday at midday, as was narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, \r\n    1\/370.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The main reason for venerating Friday prayer is because of \r\n    the divine decree that singled out this prayer and this day for special \r\n    virtues. This is one of the manifestations of Allah&rsquo;s Lordship \r\n    (ruboobiyyah), as He alone singles out for veneration whatever He Wills of \r\n    His creation and whatever times and places He chooses. He is the One Who \r\n    does whatever He wills for reasons that He, may He be glorified, knows.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the only One Who \r\n    has the power to create and to choose from among His creation. Allah, may He \r\n    be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And your Lord creates \r\n    whatsoever He wills and chooses&rdquo; [al-Qasas 28:68]<\/i>. If you ponder this \r\n    creation, you will realize that this choosing and singling out are proof of \r\n    His Lordship and Oneness, and of the perfection of His wisdom, knowledge and \r\n    might; that He is Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, and He has no \r\n    partner who can create as He creates, or choose as He chooses, or control as \r\n    He controls. This choice, control and singling out, the effects of which are \r\n    evident in this world, are among the greatest signs of His Lordship and the \r\n    greatest testimony to His Oneness, the perfection of His attributes and the \r\n    truthfulness of His Messengers.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, 1\/40-43&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-&lsquo;Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) also \r\n    stated that this singling out and choice are indicative of the inherent \r\n    virtue of the thing chosen, for which Allah blessed this time. By His \r\n    knowledge and wisdom, Allah may grant to a certain place, time or person \r\n    that which qualifies it to be chosen by Allah and favoured above others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This concept may not be understood by the one who regards all \r\n    individuals, deeds, times and places as equal, and claims that there is \r\n    nothing inherent that makes one thing better than another, and that \r\n    precedence is given to some things over others for no reason. This view is \r\n    invalid for more than forty reasons that I have listed elsewhere. It is \r\n    sufficient, in order to understand the falseness of this view and how \r\n    corrupt it is, to note that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, refuted \r\n    this false view when He said (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And when there comes to them a sign (from Allah) they \r\n    say: &lsquo;We shall not believe until we receive the like of that which the \r\n    Messengers of Allah had received.&rsquo; Allah knows best with whom to place His \r\n    Message&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-An&lsquo;aam 6:124]<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;<i>Allah knows best with whom to place His Message<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    means: not everyone is qualified or fit to&nbsp; convey His Message; rather the \r\n    Message has those who are suited to conveying it and it cannot befit any but \r\n    these people; Allah knows better than you who these people are. If all \r\n    individuals were equal -- as these people claim -- there could have been no \r\n    argument against them in this verse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they \r\n    might say: &lsquo;Is it these (poor believers) that Allah has favoured from \r\n    amongst us?&rsquo; Does not Allah know best those who are grateful?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-An&lsquo;aam 6:53]<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant is: Allah knows best who will give thanks for \r\n    His blessings, so He singles them out for His bounty from among those who \r\n    will not be grateful to Him. Not everyone is fit to thank Him or to receive \r\n    His blessings and be singled out for this honour. Those individuals and \r\n    places and so on that Allah chooses have some inherent qualities that are \r\n    not found in other people and places, and it is for that reason that Allah \r\n    chose them, gave them precedence because of those virtues and selected them. \r\n    This is His creation and His choice. <i>&ldquo;And your Lord creates whatsoever He \r\n    wills and chooses&rdquo; [al-Qasas 28:68]<\/i>. Allah does not choose anything and \r\n    give it precedence except for a reason that led to it being singled out and \r\n    given precedence. Yes, He is the One Who created this reason, as He is the \r\n    One Who created it then chose it after creating it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, 1\/53-54&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up, all the characteristics of this great prayer are \r\n    by the grace of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to His slaves.

The format of the takbeer is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, \r\n    Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa Lillaahi&rsquo;l-hamd<\/i> \r\n    (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is no god except Allaah, \r\n    Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allaah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or you can say Allaahu akbar three times, so you say:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha \r\n    ill-Allaah, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa Lillaahi&rsquo;l-hamd<\/i> \r\n    (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is \r\n    no god except Allaah, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great , Allaah is \r\n    Most Great, and all praise be to Allaah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Both are permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Men should raise their voices reciting this dhikr in the \r\n    marketplaces, mosques and homes, but women should not raise their voices.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; You should eat an odd number of dates before leaving for \r\n    the Eid prayer, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) did not set out on the day of Eid until he had eaten an odd number \r\n    of dates. He should stick to an odd number as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; You should wear your best clothes &ndash; this is for men. With \r\n    regard to women, they should not wear beautiful clothes when they go out to \r\n    the Eid prayer-place, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Let them go out looking decent&rdquo; i.e., in regular \r\n    clothes that are not fancy. It is haraam for them to go out wearing perfume \r\n    and makeup.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Some of the scholars regarded it as mustahabb to do ghusl \r\n    for the Eid prayer, because it is narrated that some of the salaf did this. \r\n    Doing ghusl for Eid prayer is mustahabb, just as it is prescribed for \r\n    Jumu&rsquo;ah because one is going to meet people. So if one does ghusl, that is \r\n    good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; The Eid prayer. The Muslims are unanimously agreed that \r\n    the Eid prayer is prescribed in Islam. Some of them say that it is Sunnah, \r\n    some say that it is fard kafaayah (a communal obligation) and some say that \r\n    it is fard &lsquo;ayn (an individual obligation), and that not doing it is a sin. \r\n    They quoted as evidence the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) commanded even the virgins and women in seclusion, \r\n    i.e., those who did not ordinarily come out, to attend the Eid prayer place, \r\n    except that those who were menstruating should keep away from the \r\n    prayer-place itself, because it is not permissible for a menstruating woman \r\n    to stay in the mosque; it is permissible for her to pass through but not to \r\n    stay there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It seems to me, based on the evidence, that it is fard &lsquo;ayn \r\n    (an individual obligation) and that every male is obliged to attend the Eid \r\n    prayer except for those who have an excuse. This was the view favoured by \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the first rak&rsquo;ah the imam should recite <i>Sabbih isma \r\n    rabbika al-A&lsquo;ala<\/i> (Soorat al-A&rsquo;la 87) and in the second rak&rsquo;ah he should \r\n    recite <i>Hal ataaka hadeeth ul-ghaashiyah<\/i> (al-Ghaashiyah 88). Or he may \r\n    recite Soorat Qaaf (50) in the first and Soorat al-Qamar (54) in the second. \r\n    Both options are narrated in saheeh reports from the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; If Jumu&rsquo;ah and Eid fall on the same day, the Eid prayer \r\n    should be held, as should Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer, as is indicated by the apparent \r\n    meaning of the hadeeth of al-Nu&rsquo;maan ibn Basheer which was narrated by \r\n    Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>. But those who attend the Eid prayer with the \r\n    imam may attend Jumu&rsquo;ah if they wish, or they may pray Zuhr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; One of the rulings on Eid prayer is that according to \r\n    many scholars, if a person comes to the Eid prayer-place before the imam \r\n    comes, he should sit down and not pray two rak&rsquo;ahs, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed Eid with two rak&rsquo;ahs, and \r\n    he did not offer any prayer before or after it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars are of the view that when a person comes \r\n    he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs, because the Eid \r\n    prayer-place is a mosque, based on the fact that menstruating women are not \r\n    allowed there, so it comes under the same rulings as a mosque, which \r\n    indicates that it is a mosque. Based on this, it comes under the general \r\n    meaning of the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him): &ldquo;When any one of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down \r\n    until he has prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs.&rdquo; With regard to the fact that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not offer any prayer \r\n    before or after the Eid prayer, that is because when he arrived the prayer \r\n    started.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it is proven that we should pray <i>Tahiyyat al-Masjid<\/i> \r\n    (two rak&rsquo;ahs to &ldquo;greet the mosque&rdquo;) when arriving at the Eid prayer-place, \r\n    as in the case of all mosques, because if we assume from the hadeeth that \r\n    there is no Tahiyyat al-Masjid for the Eid mosque, then we should say that \r\n    there is no Tahiyyat al-Masjid for the Jumu&rsquo;ah mosque either, because when \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    arrived at the Jumu&rsquo;ah mosque he would deliver the khutbah, then pray two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs then leave and pray the regular Sunnahs of Jumu&rsquo;ah in his house, so \r\n    he did not offer any prayer before it or after it (in the mosque).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What seems more likely to be correct in my view is that we \r\n    should pray two rak&rsquo;ahs in the Eid prayer-place to greet the mosque, but we \r\n    should not denounce one another with regard to this issue, because it is a \r\n    matter concerning which the scholars differ. We should not denounce others \r\n    with regard to matters where the scholars differ, unless there is a clear \r\n    text. So we should not denounce the one who prays (Tahiyyat al-Masjid) or \r\n    the one who sits down without praying.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; One of the rulings on the day of Eid &ndash; Eid al-Fitr &ndash; is \r\n    that Zakaat al-Fitr is due on this day. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that it should be paid before the \r\n    Eid prayer. It is permissible to pay it one or two days before that, because \r\n    of the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) which was \r\n    narrated by al-Bukhaari: &ldquo;They used to give it one or two days before (Eid) \r\n    al-Fitr.&rdquo; If it is paid after the Eid prayer, it does not count as Sadaqat \r\n    al-Fitr, because of the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas: &ldquo;Whoever pays it before the \r\n    prayer, it is Zakaat al-Fitr, and whoever pays it after the prayer, it is \r\n    ordinary charity.&rdquo; It is haraam to delay Zakaat al-Fitr until after the Eid \r\n    prayer. If one delays it with no excuse then it is not acceptable zakaah, \r\n    but if there is an excuse &ndash; such as if a person is traveling and does not \r\n    have anything to give or anyone to give it to, or he is expecting his family \r\n    to pay it and they are expecting him to pay it, then in this case he should \r\n    pay it when it is easy for him to do so, even if that is after the prayer, \r\n    and there is no sin on him because he has an excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9 &ndash; People should greet one another, but that results in \r\n    haraam actions on the part of many people, such as men entering houses and \r\n    shaking hands with unveiled women without any mahram being present. Some of \r\n    these evils are worse than others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We see some people denouncing those who refuse to shake hands \r\n    with those who are not their mahrams, but it is they who are the wrongdoers, \r\n    not he. But he should explain to them and tell them to ask trustworthy \r\n    scholars to verify his actions and he should tell them not to get angry and \r\n    insist on following the customs of his forefathers, because they do not make \r\n    a permissible thing forbidden or a forbidden thing permissible. He should \r\n    explain to them that if they do that, they will be like those of whom Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And similarly, We sent \r\n    not a warner before you (O Muhammad) to any town (people) but the luxurious \r\n    ones among them said: &ldquo;We found our fathers following a certain way and \r\n    religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Zukhruf 43:23]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people have the custom of going out to the graveyard on \r\n    the day of Eid to greet the occupants of the graves, but the occupants of \r\n    the graves have no need of any greeting or congratulations, because they do \r\n    not fast or pray qiyaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Visiting the graves is not something to be done especially on \r\n    the day of Eid or Friday or any particular day. It was proven that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) visited the graves \r\n    at night, as mentioned in the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah narrated by Muslim. And \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Visit \r\n    the graves for they will remind you of the Hereafter.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Visiting graves is an act of worship, and acts of worship are \r\n    not acceptable unless they are in accordance with sharee&rsquo;ah.

The \r\n    takbeer was the first thing that he would do in each rak&rsquo;ah and his \r\n    recitation was followed by rukoo&rsquo; (bowing).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Timridhi narrated from the hadeeth of Katheer ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr ibn &lsquo;Awf, from his father, from his grandfather, that \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    recited takbeer in the Eid (prayer), seven times in the first rak&rsquo;ah before \r\n    reciting Qur&rsquo;aan and five times in the second rak&rsquo;ah before reciting \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan.

And Ibn \r\n    Wahb narrated from Yoonus that Ibn Shihaab said: The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go out to the \r\n    prayer-place, then the people of the regions followed that Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbali said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (vol. 2, no. \r\n    229-230): The Sunnah is to offer the Eid prayer in the prayer-place. This \r\n    was enjoined by &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) and was regarded as \r\n    good by al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and <i>Ashaab al-Ra&rsquo;i<\/i>.

Hence the people of Makkah pray (Eid) in al-Masjid al-Haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then Ibn Qudaamah quoted evidence to support his view, and \r\n    said: Our evidence shows that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to go out to the prayer-place and leave his mosque, \r\n    as did the caliphs after him. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) would not forsake the better thing even though it was \r\n    closer and take the trouble to go to an imperfect place that was further \r\n    away, and he did not prescribe for his ummah that they should forsake that \r\n    which is good and virtuous. We have been commanded to follow the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and take him as our \r\n    example. It cannot be the case that the thing that is enjoined is imperfect \r\n    and the thing that is forbidden is perfect. There is no report that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) offered the Eid \r\n    prayer in his mosque except when there was a reason or excuse. This is also \r\n    the consensus of the Muslims. The people in all ages and in all places have \r\n    gone out to the prayer-place and offered the Eid prayer there, regardless of \r\n    whether the mosque is spacious or otherwise. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to offer the Eid prayer in the \r\n    prayer-place even though his mosque is such a venerable place.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And I &ndash; Ahmad Shaakir is speaking &ndash; say that words of Ibn \r\n    Qudaamah, &ldquo;There is no report that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) offered the Eid prayer in his mosque except when there \r\n    was a reason or excuse&rdquo;, is a reference to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which \r\n    is narrated by al-Haakim in <i>al-Mustadrak<\/i> (vol. 1, p. 295): &ldquo;Rain fell \r\n    on the day of Eid, so the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) prayed in the mosque.&rdquo; This was classed as saheeh by him \r\n    (al-Haakim) and al-Dhahabi. [And Ibn al-Qayyim said of it: If the hadeeth is \r\n    proven, it is also narrated in <i>Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i> and Ibn Maajah. <i>\r\n    Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, 1\/441. But it was classed as da&rsquo;eef by al-Albaani in <i>\r\n    Risaalat Salaat al-Eidayn fi&rsquo;l-Musalla hiya al-Sunnah<\/i>, and he narrated \r\n    the view of al-Haakim and al-Dhahabi].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam al-Shaafa&rsquo;i said in <i>al-Umm<\/i> (vol. 1, p. 207): &ldquo;We \r\n    have heard that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) used to go out on the two Eids to the prayer-place in Madeenah, \r\n    as did those who came after him, and most of the people in all countries, \r\n    except Makkah (concerning which) we have not heard that any of the salaf led \r\n    them in offering the Eid prayer except in their mosque. I think that this &ndash; \r\n    and Allaah knows best &ndash; is because al-Masjid al-Haraam is the best spot on \r\n    earth, so they did not like to pray anywhere else if possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;If there is a town and the mosque of its people is big \r\n    enough to accommodate them, I do not think that they should go out of it, \r\n    but if they do go out, there is nothing wrong with that. If it is big enough \r\n    and their imam leads them in prayer there, I regard that as makrooh but they \r\n    do not have to repeat it. If there is an excuse such as rain etc, I would \r\n    tell them to pray in the mosque and not go out to the desert.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholar Ibn al-Haaj said in <i>al-Madkhal<\/i> (vol. 2, \r\n    283): The proven Sunnah with regard to the Eid prayer is that it should be \r\n    offered in the prayer-place, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;A prayer offered in this mosque of mine is \r\n    better than a thousand prayers offered elsewhere, except in al-Masjid \r\n    al-Haraam.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 1190; Muslim, 1394). Then despite that great \r\n    virtue he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to the \r\n    prayer-place and left the mosque. This clearly indicates that the command to \r\n    go out to the prayer-place for Eid prayer is confirmed, so this is the \r\n    Sunnah. According to the madhhab of Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him), \r\n    offering the Eid prayer in the mosque is bid&rsquo;ah (an innovation), unless \r\n    there is some reason why it is necessary to do that, in which case it is not \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    did not do it and neither did any of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after him. \r\n    And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded \r\n    the women to come out to the Eid prayer, and he told the menstruating women \r\n    and women in seclusion to come out. One of them said, O Messenger of Allaah, \r\n    one of us does not have a jilbaab.&rdquo; He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Let her sister lends her a jilbaab so that she may \r\n    witness goodness and attend the gathering of the Muslims.&rdquo; (See <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Bukhari<\/i>, 324; <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, 890).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) commanded the women to go out and he prescribed the \r\n    prayer out in the open so that the symbols of Islam might be manifested.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet&rsquo;s Sunnah that is narrated in the saheeh hadeeths \r\n    indicates that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    used to offer the Eid prayer in the desert outside the city. This is how it \r\n    continued during the early days of Islam, and they did not offer the Eid \r\n    prayer inside the city unless there was a reason that made it necessary to \r\n    do so, such as rain.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of the four imams and other scholars and \r\n    imams &ndash; may Allaah be pleased with them all. I do not know of anyone who \r\n    held a different opinion, apart from the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) who preferred that the prayer be offered in the mosque if \r\n    it was big enough to hold all the people of the city. Despite that he did \r\n    not see anything wrong with praying in the desert even if the mosque was big \r\n    enough. And he clearly stated that he regarded it as makrooh to offer the \r\n    Eid prayer in the mosque if it was not big enough to hold all the people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These saheeh ahaadeeth and others, and the fact that this is \r\n    how they continued to do it during the early days of Islam, and the views of \r\n    the scholars, all indicate that offering the Eid prayers in the mosques now \r\n    is a bid&rsquo;ah (innovation), even according to the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because \r\n    there is no one mosque in our cities that can accommodate all the people of \r\n    the city where it is located.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, this is the Sunnah, to gather all the people of the \r\n    city, men, women and children, so that their hearts may turn to Allaah as \r\n    one and they may be united, praying behind one imam, saying &ldquo;<i>Allaahu \r\n    akbar<\/i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i>&rdquo;, praying to Allaah with \r\n    sincerity, as if they are one, rejoicing in the blessing that Allaah has \r\n    bestowed upon them, so that the Eid will be a true Eid. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) commanded the women to go out to the Eid prayer with the \r\n    people, and he did not exclude anyone from that. He did not even excuse \r\n    those who had nothing to wear from going out, rather he commanded them to \r\n    borrow something from someone else. He even commanded those who had an \r\n    excuse for not praying to go out to the prayer-place, &ldquo;to witness goodness \r\n    and attend the gathering of the Muslims.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    and the caliphs after him, and the governors whom they appointed in the \r\n    various cities, used to led the people in offering the Eid prayer, then they \r\n    would address them, exhorting them and teaching them things that would \r\n    benefit them in their religious and worldly concerns. They would command \r\n    them to give in charity in that blessed gathering, upon which descended \r\n    divine mercy and blessing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    May the Muslims follow the Sunnah of their Prophet and revive \r\n    the symbols of their religion, which is the source of their pride and \r\n    success.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

The apparent meaning is that two \r\n    khutbahs should be given, but whoever examines the Sunnah in agreed-upon \r\n    reports in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> and elsewhere will see that the Prophet SAWS \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only gave one khutbah, but after \r\n    he had finished the first khutbah, he went to the women and exhorted them. \r\n    If we take this as the basic principle concerning it being prescribed to \r\n    give two khutbahs, then it is possible, although it is unlikely, because he \r\n    went to the women and addressed them because they could not hear the \r\n    khutbah.

Some of these reports are in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i>, including the hadeeth\r\n      narrated by &#145;Aa&#146;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her): &#147;The sun was\r\n      eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n      upon him), and the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n      went out, stood up and said <i>Takbeer<\/i> (&#145;Allaahu akbar&#146;), and the people\r\n      formed rows behind him. The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n      upon him) recited a lengthy recitation and did a lengthy rukoo&#146;, then he raised his\r\n      head and said, &#145;<i>Sami&#146;a Allaahu liman hamidah, Rabbanaa wa laka&#146;l-hamd<\/i>.&#146;\r\n      Then he stood upright and recited another lengthy recitation, shorter than the first. Then\r\n      he said &#145;Allaahu akbar&#146; and did another lengthy rukoo&#146;, shorter than the\r\n      first. Then he said, &#145;<i>Sami&#146;a Allaahu liman hamidah, Rabbanaa wa\r\n      laka&#146;l-hamd<\/i>.&#146; Then he did sujood. Then in the second rak&#146;ah he did\r\n      likewise, until he had completed four rukoo&#146;s and four sujoods, and the eclipse was\r\n      over before he had finished.&#148; (Agreed upon).<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>It is sunnah to pray Salaat al-Kusoof in jamaa&#146;ah (congregation),\r\n        because this is what the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, but\r\n        it is permissible to pray it individually, as with all other naafil prayers. However,\r\n        praying it in congregation is better.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>It is sunnah for the imaam to address the people after the prayer, and\r\n        to warn them against negligence and being led astray, and to tell them to make lots of\r\n        du&#146;aa&#146; and ask for forgiveness. In <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> it is narrated from\r\n        &#145;Aa&#146;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet SAWS (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) finished his prayer then addressed the people and started\r\n        by praising Allaah then he said, &#147;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of\r\n        Allaah, and they do not become eclipsed for the death or the birth of anyone. If you see\r\n        that, then call on Allaah, perform salaah, give charity&#133;&#148; <\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>If the prayer ends before the eclipse does, then remember Allaah (dhikr)\r\n        and call on Him (du&#146;aa&#146;) until the eclipse ends. The prayer should not be\r\n        repeated. If the eclipse ends before the prayer, then the prayer should be completed\r\n        quickly, but it should not be stopped or cut off abruptly, because Allaah says\r\n        (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;and render not vain your deeds&#148; [Muhammad\r\n        47:33]<\/i>. The prayer should be at the time of the eclipse, because the Prophet SAWS\r\n        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;&#133; until it (the eclipse) is\r\n        over&#133;&#148; and he also said, &#147;&#133; until what you are going through is over\r\n        &#133;&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: &#147;Sometimes eclipses last for a\r\n    long time, and sometimes for a short time, depending on how much of the sun or moon is\r\n    eclipsed. The entire sun or moon may be eclipsed, or only half of it, or one-third. If it\r\n    is a total eclipse, then the prayer should last long enough for all of <i>al-Baqarah<\/i>\r\n    or something of similar length to be recited in the first rak&#146;ah, and in the next\r\n    rak&#146;ah a shorter recitation is made. There are saheeh ahaadeeth narrated from the\r\n    Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as we have mentioned, and it is\r\n    prescribed to shorten the prayer if the reason for it [i.e., the eclipse] is no longer\r\n    there. So if it is known that the eclipse will not last for long, or if it started to get\r\n    less, one should still pray, but the prayer should be shortened. This is the opinion of\r\n    the majority of scholars, because this prayer is prescribed for a specific reason, and if\r\n    the reason is no longer there and the eclipse is over, one should not pray.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"5899","question_id":"5899","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the sun is eclipsed after the Adhaan for\r\n    &lsquo;Asr, you should pray the obligatory prayer first (i.e., &lsquo;Asr), then pray Salaat\r\n    al-Kusoof.

When astronomy and the calculations of the movements of\r\n      the sun and moon became well known in later times, and it became known\r\n      that the experts could know when an eclipse was likely to happen, the\r\n      scholars (&lsquo;ulamaa&rsquo;) pointed out that this did not change the ruling,\r\n      and that the Muslims still had to do what they were commanded to do at the\r\n      time of an eclipse, even if they knew about it in advance.<span>&nbsp;\r\n      <\/span>But it is not prescribed to concern ourselves with the matter of\r\n      predicting eclipses, because that is not what Allaah and His Messenger\r\n      commanded us to do. The scholars also explained that an eclipse may be a\r\n      sign or a cause of something bad happening to people. When the questioner\r\n      says that eclipses do not cause hrm, she is speaking without knowledge and\r\n      objecting to the sharee&rsquo;ah of Allaah. People do not necessarily know of\r\n      the events which Allaah causes to happen at the time of an eclipse, and\r\n      some people may know about that whilst others do not. It could be that\r\n      because of the Muslims&rsquo; prayers, Allaah wards off bad things which are\r\n      known only to Him. The Muslim must submit to the ruling of Allaah and act\r\n      in accordance with His sharee&rsquo;ah, and have faith in His wisdom, because\r\n      He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, may He be glorified and exalted.\r\n      \r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;<span><i>(Written by\r\n      Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak).<\/i>\r\n      \r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;<span>Solar and\r\n      lunar eclipses are two of the signs of Allaah with which He scares His\r\n      slaves and reminds them of some of the things which will happen on the Day\r\n      of Resurrection, when the sun will be wound round and will lose its light\r\n      and be overthrown and the stars will fall (cf. al-Takweer 81:1), and the\r\n      sight will be dazed, the moon will be eclipsed and the sun and moon will\r\n      be joined together (by going into one another, or folded up, or deprived\r\n      of their light) (al-Qiyaamah 75:8-9). This is why Muslims should be\r\n      alarmed by eclipses. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n      upon him) used to fear Allaah very much, and one day he came out in an\r\n      agitated state, thinking that the Hour had begun, when the sun was\r\n      eclipsed during his lifetime&hellip; This is indicative of the great extent to\r\n      which he kept the Hour in mind and feared it. We, on the other hand, have\r\n      become negligent and most people no longer think of eclipses as anything\r\n      other than a natural phenomenon which they go out to watch with special\r\n      glasses, carrying cameras. They limit themselves to the worldly scientific\r\n      explanation without understanding the reminder of the Hereafter which it\r\n      brings. This is one of the signs of hard-heartedness and a lack of concern\r\n      about the matters of the Hereafter. It reflects a lack of fear of the\r\n      onset of the Hour, and ignorance of the aims of sharee&rsquo;ah and the\r\n      reports that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n      used to feel fear when these eclipses happened. The Sahaabah (may Allaah\r\n      be pleased with them) used to stand to pray the eclipse prayer, because\r\n      they believed that if indeed the Hour had come, they would not then be\r\n      counted negligent of their prayer, and if this eclipse was nothing to do with the Hour, then they would not lose anything by praying, for they would have earned a great reward. We ask Allaah to make us among those who fear Him and who are afraid of the Hour.

We should point \r\n    out that discussion with the kuffaar about matters of Islam should only be \r\n    undertaken by specialists, lest one of them instil doubts in the mind of the \r\n    Muslim who wants to call them and he becomes confused as to how to answer \r\n    them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Although we appreciate your sending his question to us and \r\n    not answering him yourself, we advise you &ndash; and those who call others to \r\n    Allaah in general &ndash; not to give the kuffaar the opportunity to debate minor \r\n    practical issues. Rather discussion with them should be about basic issues \r\n    from which these minor issues stem and on which they are based. So you \r\n    should speak about the Oneness of God (Tawheed), proving the Resurrection \r\n    and the Reckoning, the message of our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), explaining the beauties of Islam and how \r\n    it is in accordance with sound human nature and commonsense, refuting shirk, \r\n    and presenting proof and evidence to support that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no reason why you should not reply concerning some \r\n    of these issues to one whom you know wants to find out the truth; this \r\n    response may open the door to his entering the religion of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are some misunderstandings in this non-Muslim&rsquo;s \r\n    question, and these mistakes must be addressed before starting to answer in \r\n    detail. There is no connection between Allaah&rsquo;s being before all things and \r\n    the regular Sunnah prayers being offered before the obligatory prayers, \r\n    because the prescription of doing prayers in this order comes from Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps he thinks that the naafil and regular Sunnah prayers \r\n    are offered to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)! \r\n    Perhaps this is why he is confused about this issue, so he thinks that we \r\n    draw near to Allaah by offering the regular Sunnah prayers to the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the obligatory prayers \r\n    to Allaah, may He be exalted. Undoubtedly this is ignorance of the religion \r\n    of Islam, and it will not be difficult for the Muslim to refute it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whatever the case, we are the slaves of our Lord, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, and we do what He commands us. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not enjoin upon the people \r\n    anything other than that which Allaah commanded him to convey. He is a slave \r\n    of his Lord just as we are, and the difference between him and us is that \r\n    Allaah honoured him with the Revelation and Message. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Say (O Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; \r\n    &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>): &lsquo;I am only a man like you.

Concerning the virtue of these, it is \r\n    narrated that the one who prays them regularly will have a house built for \r\n    him in Paradise. This has been discussed in the answer to question no. 1048. \r\n    They are: two rak'ahs before Fajr, four rak&rsquo;ahs before Zuhr and two rak&rsquo;ahs \r\n    after, two rak&rsquo;ahs after Maghrib and two rak&rsquo;ahs after &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have mentioned \r\n    some rulings concerning prayers offered before the obligatory prayer. It is \r\n    well known that the one who enters the mosque should pray two rak&rsquo;ahs before \r\n    sitting down. It is also Sunnah to pray two rak'ahs after doing wudoo&rsquo;, and \r\n    also to offer regular Sunnah prayers before some prayers such as Fajr and \r\n    Zuhr &ndash; as stated above. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) also encouraged praying four rak&rsquo;ahs before &lsquo;Asr, and he \r\n    prescribed a (Sunnah) prayer before Maghrib, and between the adhaan and \r\n    iqaamah. All of this is a prescription to offer naafil prayers before the \r\n    obligatory prayers, and there is great wisdom in that. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are many benefits in these regular Sunnah prayers, and \r\n    offering them regularly is one of the means of entering Paradise and being \r\n    saved from Hell, along with offering the obligatory prayers and avoiding \r\n    haraam things. They are voluntary and not obligatory, but as it says in the \r\n    hadeeth, the obligatory prayers are perfected by them. They are among the \r\n    means of attaining Allaah&rsquo;s love, and doing them is following the example of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So the \r\n    believer should offer them regularly and pay attention to them as the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did with the Sunnah \r\n    prayer of Duha, and tahajjud at night and Witr, so the believer should pay \r\n    attention to all of that. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> \r\n    (11\/381).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Attiyah Saalim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim should offer the naafil prayer before the \r\n    obligatory one so as to prepare himself to stand before Allaah when he has \r\n    the best presence of mind possible. This is a kind of preparation or \r\n    introduction, because it makes you more alert and focused, and more eager to \r\n    seek that which is with Allaah. If you start the obligatory prayer \r\n    straightaway, you may realize that you need some preparation for it. But if \r\n    you pray the sunnah prayer first, you will be more prepared. Every \r\n    obligatory prayer &ndash; as we said &ndash; has a naafil prayer before it. Fajr has two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs before it, Zuhr has two or four rak'ahs before it, and &lsquo;Asr has four \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs before it. They used to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs before Maghrib; al-Raawi \r\n    said: So that if a stranger entered the mosque, and saw people standing \r\n    behind the pillars, he would think that the people had already prayed \r\n    Maghrib. It says in the hadeeth: &ldquo;Pray before Maghrib, pray before Maghrib, \r\n    pray before Maghrib,&rdquo; and the third time he said: &ldquo;for those who wish,&rdquo; \r\n    because he did not want the people to take it as a binding Sunnah. And he \r\n    said: &ldquo;Between each two calls there is a prayer,&rdquo; and Maghrib like all other \r\n    prayers has two calls, namely the adhaan and iqaamah. Similarly before \r\n    &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; there is a naafil prayer, and another after it. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh al-Arba&rsquo;een al-Nawawiyyah<\/i> \r\n    (hadeeth no. 30)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah preserve \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The regular Sunnah prayers were prescribed for important \r\n    reasons. If the worshipper starts with the obligatory prayer straight away, \r\n    his focus and presence of mind is less than it would be if he had offered \r\n    the Sunnah prayer before the obligatory prayer, as is the case with Zuhr. At \r\n    the time of Zuhr people are tired and distracted because of their work and \r\n    the toughness of seeking to earn a living, so if they start to pray when \r\n    they have just come from doing business and so on, they will be less focused \r\n    than if they had started with the Sunnah prayer and then started the \r\n    obligatory prayer after that. Worship calms one down and makes one more \r\n    focused, and this is learned from the practice of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When he wanted to pray qiyaam al-layl, \r\n    he started with two brief rak&rsquo;ahs, and they said: Because this initial \r\n    action prepares one to pray at length, and it helps one to focus properly. \r\n    The regular Sunnah prayers serve the same purpose. This also happens with \r\n    the person who comes late to the prayer, or who comes as the iqaamah is \r\n    being given. When he starts to pray you will not find him having the same \r\n    focus as if he had come between the adhaan and iqaamah and offered the \r\n    regular Sunnah prayer and remembered Allaah. One good deed leads to another, \r\n    so after offering the Sunnah prayer you will find that he is more focused \r\n    and more calm, and this makes him more able to offer the obligatory prayer \r\n    with proper presence of mind. This applies if the regular Sunnah prayer \r\n    comes before the obligatory one.

He said: &#8220;Then help me to help you by prostrating a \r\n\tgreat deal.&#8221; Based on that, the general principle concerning voluntary \r\n\tprayer is that it is prescribed at all times, for the one who is at home and \r\n\tthe one who is travelling, but there are some times during which the \r\n\tLawgiver has disallowed prayer, and these times are five&#8230;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>End quote \r\n\tfrom <i>ash-Sharh al-Mumti&#8216;<\/i> by Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n\tmercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>A number of \r\n\tfuqaha&#8217; made exceptions for some types of naafil prayer at times when prayer \r\n\tis not allowed.

That is because of the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi \r\n\t(219) and an-Nasaa&#8217;i (858) from Yazeed ibn al-Aswad al-&#8216;Aamiri who said: I \r\n\twas present with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n\tduring his Hajj, and I prayed Fajr with him in the mosque of al-Khayf.

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n\tbe upon him) was distracted and did not offer the Sunnah prayer after Zuhr, \r\n\tso he prayed it after &#8216;Asr. It was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1233) and Muslim \r\n\t(834) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to \r\n\tUmm Salamah: &#8220;O daughter of Abu Umayyah, you asked about the two rak&#8216;ahs \r\n\tafter &#8216;Asr. Some people from Banu &#8216;Abd al-Qays came to me, and they \r\n\tdistracted me from praying the two rak&#8216;ahs that come after Zuhr; these are \r\n\tthey (i.e., I prayed them now).&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>-4-<\/p>\r\n\t<p>One who \r\n\tcomes in on Friday when the imam is delivering the khutbah; he may pray two \r\n\tbrief rak&#8216;ahs, even if that is at the time when the sun is high. That is \r\n\tbecause of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (931) and Muslim (875) from \r\n\tJaabir, who said: A man came in on Friday when the Prophet (blessings and \r\n\tpeace of Allah be upon him) was delivering the khutbah. He said: &#8220;Have you \r\n\tprayed?&#8221; He said: No. He said: &#8220;Get up and pray two rak&#8216;ahs.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>-5-<\/p>\r\n\t<p>The funeral \r\n\tprayer may be offered during the lengthy times when prayer is not allowed, \r\n\taccording to scholarly consensus, i.e., after Fajr prayer until the sun \r\n\trises and after &#8216;Asr prayer until the sun sets.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Ibn Qudaamah \r\n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said: The funeral prayer may be offered. With \r\n\tregard to offering the funeral prayer after Fajr prayer until the sun rises \r\n\tand after &#8216;Asr until the sun sets, there is no difference of scholarly \r\n\topinion concerning it. Ibn al-Mundhir said: The consensus of the Muslims is \r\n\tthat the funeral prayer may be offered after &#8216;Asr and Fajr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>With regard \r\n\tto offering the funeral prayer at the three times mentioned in the hadeeth \r\n\tof &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir, that is not permissible. This was mentioned by al-Qaadi \r\n\tand others. Al-Athram said: I asked Abu &#8216;Abdullah about offering the funeral \r\n\tprayer when the sun has just risen. He said: As for (doing so) when the sun \r\n\thas just risen, I do not like that. Then he quoted the hadeeth of &#8216;Uqbah ibn \r\n\t&#8216;Aamir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>A similar \r\n\topinion was narrated from Jaabir and Ibn &#8216;Umar. This was quoted by Maalik in\r\n\t<i>al-Muwatta&#8217;<\/i> from Ibn &#8216;Umar. And al-Khattaabi said: This is the view \r\n\tof the majority of scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tAbu&#8217;l-Khattaab said, narrating a different report from Ahmad, that offering \r\n\tthe funeral prayer is permissible at all times when prayer is disallowed. \r\n\tAnd this is the view of ash-Shaafa&#8216;i, because it is a prayer that is \r\n\tpermitted after Fajr and &#8216;Asr, so it is permitted at all times, like the \r\n\tobligatory prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>But &#8216;Uqbah \r\n\tibn &#8216;Aamir said: There are three times at which the Messenger of Allah (sa) \r\n\tforbade us to pray or to bury our dead. The fact that he mentioned the \r\n\tprayer along with burial indicates that what is meant is the funeral prayer, \r\n\tbecause it is a prayer other than the five obligatory prayers, so it is not \r\n\tpermissible to do it at these three times, as is the case with all naafil \r\n\tprayers in general. Rather it is permitted after Fajr and &#8216;Asr because these \r\n\tperiods may be lengthy and waiting may not be convenient, but these three \r\n\tother periods are brief. With regard to the obligatory prayers, they cannot \r\n\tbe taken as an analogy, because they have to be done, and it is not valid to \r\n\tdraw an analogy between these three times and the other two times, because \r\n\tthe prohibition in this case (the three times) is clearer and they are \r\n\tshorter, so there is no fear for the deceased in this case. Moreover, it is \r\n\tforbidden to bury the deceased at this time, and when the prayer is \r\n\tmentioned in conjunction with the burial, this signifies that what is meant \r\n\tis the funeral prayer, unlike the other two times.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>End quote \r\n\tfrom <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/425&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>The wording \r\n\tof the hadeeth of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him) is: \r\n\tThere are three times when the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \r\n\tAllah be upon him) told us not to pray or bury our dead: when the sun begins \r\n\tto rise until it is high, when it is standing directly overhead at noon, and \r\n\twhen it has started to set, until it has set..

One of their \r\n\tdifferences has to do with naafil prayers that done for a reason, such as \r\n\t&#8220;greeting the mosque&#8221; (<i>tahiyyat al-masjid<\/i>) and the Sunnah prayer \r\n\tfollowing wudoo&#8217;. Some of them said that it is permissible to do them at \r\n\ttimes when prayer is not allowed; this is the view of ash-Shaafa&#8216;i (may \r\n\tAllah have mercy on him), and was favoured by a number of the scholars, and \r\n\tit is the more correct view.

One of the \r\n    strongest such reports is that narrated by Muslim from Abu Nadrah al-&lsquo;Awfi, \r\n    which says that Abu Sa&rsquo;eed told them that they asked the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about Witr and he said: &ldquo;Witr comes \r\n    before dawn.&rdquo; They differed as to whether it is permissible to pray it after \r\n    dawn.

Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) was distracted by \r\n    the wars against the apostates and his reign was short, lasting only two \r\n    years.

All that &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) did was to go back to that Sunnah and revive it.

If your companion was going to pray in another \r\n    mosque and that would help him to have better focus, then there is no blame \r\n    on him.

This implies that it is \r\n    valid but its reward is reduced. This hadeeth is to be understood as \r\n    referring to offering naafil prayers when one is able to stand; he will have \r\n    half the reward of one who prays standing. But if a person offers a naafil \r\n    prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, his reward will not be \r\n    reduced; rather he will have the same reward as one who prays standing. But \r\n    with regard to the obligatory prayer, if a person prays sitting when he is \r\n    able to stand, it is not valid and he will not have any reward for it; \r\n    rather he is sinning by doing that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our companions said: if he regards doing that as permissible, \r\n    this is kufr and the rulings on apostates apply to him, as is the case if he \r\n    regards zina, riba and other known haraam things as permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he offers an obligatory prayer sitting because he is \r\n    unable to stand, or he does so lying down because he is unable to stand or \r\n    sit, then his reward will be like that of one who prays standing and it will \r\n    not be reduced, according to the consensus of our companions. Thus the \r\n    hadeeth is to be understood as discussing the issue of reward for one who \r\n    offers a naafil prayer sitting when he is able to stand.

The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray at night, and when \r\n    he got tired he would sit down, then when he was going to bow, he would get \r\n    up and bow.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    her) said: I did not see the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) reciting in any night prayer whilst sitting until he grew \r\n    old, then he would recite whilst sitting, and when there were thirty or \r\n    forty verses left of the soorah, he would stand up and recite them, then he \r\n    would bow.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1148) and Muslim (731).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <i>Sharh \r\n    Muslim<\/i>: This indicates that it is permissible in the same rak&lsquo;ah to \r\n    stand for part of it and sit for part of it.

Some of the early \r\n    scholars disallowed that, but that is extreme. Al-Qaadi narrated from Abu \r\n    Yoosuf and Muhammad, the two companions of Abu Haneefah, among others, that \r\n    it is makrooh to sit after standing, but if the person intended to stand, \r\n    then he wanted to sit down, that is permissible in our view and that of the \r\n    majority.

When he realized that \r\n    they were doing that, he started praying seated (so that people could not \r\n    see him and follow him in prayer). Then he came out to them and said: &ldquo;I \r\n    know what you did. O people, pray in your houses, for the best of a man&rsquo;s \r\n    prayer is in his house, apart from the obligatory prayers.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (698) and Muslim (781).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Maalik said: Rabee&lsquo;ah and more than one of our scholars would \r\n    leave and not pray qiyaam with the people. Maalik said: And I also do that; \r\n    and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did \r\n    not pray qiyaam except in his house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shaafa&lsquo;i also quoted as evidence the hadeeth of Zayd ibn \r\n    Thaabit, which he quoted. And al-Shaafa&lsquo;i said: The point is further \r\n    emphasized by the fact that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) told them to pray qiyaam in their homes rather than in \r\n    his mosque despite all the virtue that there is in that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Tamheed<\/i>, 8\/116&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr also said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If offering a naafil prayer at home is better than offering \r\n    it in the mosque of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, \r\n    what can be clearer than this? Hence Maalik and al-Shaafa&lsquo;i, and those who \r\n    followed their path, thought that praying alone at home was better in the \r\n    case of all naafil prayers. If qiyaam is held in the mosque in Ramadan, even \r\n    with the smallest number of people, prayer at home is still better.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Istidhkaar<\/i>, 2\/73&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted that those imams who said that praying \r\n    Taraweeh alone at home is better than praying it in congregation in the \r\n    mosque only applied that to the one who has memorised some Qur&rsquo;aan &ndash; or the \r\n    entire Qur&rsquo;aan &ndash; and has the motivation to pray at home and there is no fear \r\n    that he will become lazy and miss the prayer, and that the prayer in \r\n    congregation in the mosque will not be affected by his absence.

This is that for it to be preferable for a person to pray in his \r\n    house on his own rather than offering the prayer in the Haramain, he should \r\n    be one of the people of the Haramain (i.e., a resident of Makkah or \r\n    Madinah). The one who comes to the Haram in Makkah to do &lsquo;umrah &ndash; and, \r\n    similarly, the one who comes to Madinah to pray in the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque &ndash; is \r\n    not subject to the ruling that praying Taraweeh in his house is preferable.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muhammad al-Dasooqi al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The recommendation to do it (pray Taraweeh) in one&rsquo;s house is \r\n    subject to three conditions: that the mosques should not be left empty, that \r\n    he has the motivation to do it and he should not be one of those who are \r\n    coming from afar to visit the Haramain. If one of these conditions is \r\n    absent, then doing it in the mosque is preferable.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Haashiyat al-Dasooqi<\/i>, 1\/315&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Looking at the state of people nowadays &ndash; including many of \r\n    the good and righteous youth who are devoted to worship &ndash; we find that \r\n    praying Taraweeh in congregation in the mosque is better for them, because \r\n    praying in the mosque is very encouraging for them, as it is done at the \r\n    beginning of the night, and because of the beauty of the imam&rsquo;s voice &ndash; for \r\n    those who seek to pray with an imam like this &ndash; and because of the large \r\n    numbers of people who pray. And also because there are many distractions in \r\n    the home that lead people to become lazy in offering the prayer. Hence we \r\n    think that calling on ordinary people nowadays to pray Taraweeh at home is \r\n    an invitation to abandon this prayer! Where are those who have memorized \r\n    anything of the Qur&rsquo;aan among those people? What else will these people be \r\n    doing if they are not praying in the mosque at the beginning of the night? \r\n    Where is the motive that will make them get up at the end of the night to \r\n    pray qiyaam?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we assume that the correct view concerning this matter \r\n    according to some people is the second opinion, then let this apply only to \r\n    the elite, not the common folk; perhaps this is what was meant by those \r\n    among the salaf who favoured this opinion. Hence &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattab (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with him) gathered the people together in the mosque to \r\n    pray Taraweeh, and he prayed on his own in his house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How beautiful are the words of Imam Malik, who summed up what \r\n    we are trying to say. When Ibn al-Qaasim asked him about whether it is \r\n    better for a man to pray qiyaam in Ramadan with the people or on his own in \r\n    his house?

This is the view favoured by our shaykh, Abu&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    ibn Taymiyah, and he did not base his view on the hadeeth of Layth from \r\n    Mujaahid from Abu&rsquo;l-Khaleel from Abu Qataadah from the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him), which states that it is makrooh to pray at \r\n    midday except on Friday, and he said: &ldquo;Hell flares up (at noon) except on \r\n    Friday&rdquo;. Rather he based his view on a report which states that whoever \r\n    comes to Jumu&lsquo;ah, it is mustahabb for him to pray until the imam comes out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He quoted the hadeeth of Salmaan mentioned above, then he \r\n    said: The report recommends praying as much as is decreed for one, and not \r\n    stopping until the time when the imam comes out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence more than one of the salaf, including &lsquo;Umar ibn \r\n    al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), who was followed in that by \r\n    Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, said that the appearance of the imam prevents prayer \r\n    and his khutbah prevents speaking.

That is permissible and it is not a problem from the point of \r\n    view of it being prayer. Rather the problem is what the common folk and most \r\n    of those who think of themselves as knowledgeable believe, that it is a \r\n    Sunnah prayer before Jumu&lsquo;ah, as they pray Sunnah before Zuhr, and they \r\n    declare their intention that it is the Sunnah of Jumu&lsquo;ah, and offer their \r\n    own reasoning for this view, based on the idea that if we say that Jumu&lsquo;ah \r\n    is a shortened form of Zuhr, then it has the same as Zuhr (Sunnah prayers \r\n    before and after, and so on).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    None of that is based on a proper examination of the issue. \r\n    There is no Sunnah before Jumu&lsquo;ah, like &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; and Maghrib, and also like \r\n    &lsquo;Asr according to one opinion, which is the correct opinion according to \r\n    some of them. It is a prayer that is like no other, with its own merits.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence that there is no Sunnah before it is that what \r\n    is meant when we describe a prayer as being &ldquo;Sunnah&rdquo; is that it is based on \r\n    words or actions narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him). There is no report from the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) to indicate that the prayer before Jumu&lsquo;ah is \r\n    Sunnah, and it is possible to draw an analogy between prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    However, when it comes to praying after Jumu&lsquo;ah, it is \r\n    narrated in <i>as-Saheeh<\/i> that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) used to pray two rak&lsquo;ahs after Jumu&lsquo;ah. [Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (937) and Muslim (882) from the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar] and that \r\n    he said: &ldquo;Whoever among you wants to pray after Jumu&lsquo;ah, let him pray four \r\n    (rak&lsquo;ahs) Narrated by Muslim (881). Abu &lsquo;Eesa at-Tirmidhi said: It was \r\n    narrated from &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) that he \r\n    instructed people to pray two rak&lsquo;ahs then four after Jumu&lsquo;ah. &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; said: I \r\n    saw Ibn &lsquo;Umar praying two rak&lsquo;ahs after Jumu&lsquo;ah, then he prayed four after \r\n    that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you say: at-Tirmidhi also narrated from Ibn Mas&lsquo;ood (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with him) that he used to pray four rak&lsquo;ahs before Jumu&lsquo;ah \r\n    and four afterwards, and this was the view of an-Nawawi and Ibn al-Mubaarak, \r\n    so this indicates that there is a Sunnah prayer before it of four rak&lsquo;ahs, \r\n    as is also the case with Zuhr,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My response is: what is meant by &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Mas&lsquo;ood \r\n    praying four rak&lsquo;ahs before Jumu&lsquo;ah is that he used to do that voluntarily \r\n    until the imam came out, as we have mentioned above. How do you know that he \r\n    believed that it was the Sunnah prayer of Jumu&lsquo;ah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    More than that was narrated from others among the Sahaabah \r\n    (may Allah be pleased with them). Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir said: We narrated \r\n    from Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he used to pray twelve \r\n    rak&lsquo;ahs before Jumu&lsquo;ah. It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him) that he used to pray eight rak&lsquo;ahs. This indicates that \r\n    they did this as something voluntary on their own initiative, without any \r\n    instructions from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), \r\n    hence the variation in the numbers (of rak&lsquo;ahs) narrated from them. The \r\n    matter of voluntary prayers is broad in scope. And perhaps they did that, or \r\n    most of it, before the adhaan and the onset of the time for Jumu&lsquo;ah, because \r\n    they used to come early and pray until the imam came out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They used to do something similar in the case of Eid prayer, \r\n    and it is definitively known that there is no Sunnah prayer connected to the \r\n    Eid prayer. They used to pray after the sun had risen high, either in the \r\n    musalla (prayer place) or in their houses, then they would offer the Eid \r\n    prayer. That was narrated from a number of the Sahaabah and Taabi&lsquo;een, and \r\n    al-Haafiz al-Bayhaqi devoted a chapter to that in his <i>Sunan<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover the evidence that this is correct is the fact that \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to come out of \r\n    his house on Friday and ascend his minbar, then the mu&rsquo;adhdhin would give \r\n    the call to prayer, and when he had finished the Prophet would start his \r\n    khutbah. If there were any Sunnah prayer before Jumu&lsquo;ah, he would have told \r\n    them to pray Sunnah after the adhaan and he would have done it himself. At \r\n    the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there \r\n    was only this adhaan immediately before the khutbah, and that is the Maaliki \r\n    madhhab until the present day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you were to say: perhaps he (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) offered the Sunnah prayer in his house after the sun passed the \r\n    zenith, then he came out? I would say: If he did that, his wives (may Allah \r\n    be pleased with them) would have narrated it from him as they narrated all \r\n    other prayer s that he did in his house by night and by day, and the way in \r\n    which he prayed tahajjud and qiyaam al-layl. As no such thing as been \r\n    narrated, the basic principle is that it did not happen and that it was not \r\n    prescribed.

That is because \r\n    the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is not applicable to what they sought. In du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; al-istikhaarah \r\n    it says &ldquo;then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me.&rdquo; \r\n    How can this be applicable to a matter of fiqh or the status of a narrator \r\n    of hadeeth?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It seems that these imams \r\n    were asking Allaah to help them to reach the right conclusion with regard to \r\n    matters of knowledge, not that they were saying the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of istikhaarah \r\n    with the salaah offered beforehand.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The aim of istikhaarah is \r\n    to ask for guidance from Allaah to the better of two matters concerning \r\n    which one is hesitating, because guidance and help come from Allaah; He \r\n    knows and we do not know; He is the Knower of the unseen. The one who relies \r\n    on himself will go astray, and the one who trusts in his reason and does not \r\n    seek the help of his Lord will be doomed. The most important thing \r\n    concerning which a person should seek the help of Allaah is correct \r\n    understanding of Allaah&rsquo;s religion and choosing the most correct and best \r\n    opinion, and istikhaarah or seeking Allaah&rsquo;s guidance in choosing is the \r\n    best means of achieving that; it may be the best way of choosing between two \r\n    opinions when the evidence is very confusing. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is no reason why the \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the imam or faqeeh, asking his Lord to guide him to the correct \r\n    opinion regarding issues of knowledge should not be preceded by salaah \r\n    (prayer), and this action may loosely be called istikhaarah, or that name \r\n    can be applied to the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and not the prayer. As for the salaah and \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; mentioned in the famous hadeeth of Jaabir, this cannot be what they \r\n    were referring to when they spoke of praying istikhaarah, asking Allaah for \r\n    guidance concerning such and such.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And finally:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It should not be thought \r\n    that asking for guidance with regard to matters of knowledge is contrary to \r\n    what Allaah has enjoined of seeking evidence and proof. Resorting to \r\n    istikhaarah or praying for guidance is to be resorted to when there is no \r\n    evidence or it is not clear, or there is a contradiction with equally strong \r\n    evidence, or when the issues is confused in the scholar&rsquo;s mind and he cannot \r\n    understand it. None of that means ignoring evidence and proof, rather it is \r\n    seeking the help of Allaah to understand, and turning to Him and asking Him \r\n    for guidance to the truth. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) used to ask Allaah to guide him to the truth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated that \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: \r\n    When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got up to \r\n    pray at night, he would start his prayer with the words: &ldquo;O Allaah, Lord of \r\n    Jibra&rsquo;eel, Mika&rsquo;eel and Israfeel, Originator of the heavens and the earth, \r\n    Knower of the unseen and the seen, You judge between Your slaves concerning \r\n    that wherein they differ. Guide me concerning that wherein they differ of \r\n    the truth by Your leave, for You guide whomsoever You will to a straight \r\n    path.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Narrated by Muslim (770).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>For information on Salaat \r\n    al-Istikhaarah and some of the rulings concerning it, please see the answer \r\n    to question no.

With\r\n    regard to matters that are <i>waajib<\/i> (obligatory) or <i>mustahabb<\/i> (liked or\r\n    encouraged), there is no need for istikhaarah to decide whether to do them, and with\r\n    regard to matters that are <i>haraam<\/i> (forbidden) or <i>makrooh<\/i> (disliked), there\r\n    is no need for istikhaarah to decide whether to avoid them. The issue of istikhaarah is\r\n    confined to matters that are <i>mubaah<\/i> (allowed), or in mustahabb matters when there\r\n    is a decision to be made as to which one should be given priority.&#146; I say: it refers\r\n    to both great and small matters, and probably an insignificant issue could form the\r\n    groundwork for a big issue.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The phrase &#145;If any one of you is concerned&#133;&#146; appears in\r\n    the version narrated by Ibn Mas&#146;ood as: &#145;if any one of you wants to do\r\n    something&#133;&#146;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;Let him pray two rak&#146;ahs of non-obligatory prayer.&#146;\r\n    This is mentioned to make it clear that it does not mean fajr prayer, for example.\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Adhkaar<\/i>: He can pray istikaarah after two rak&#146;ahs of\r\n    regular sunnah prayer done at zuhr for example, or after two rak&#146;ahs of any naafil\r\n    prayers whether they are regularly performed or not&#133; It seems to be the case that if\r\n    he made the intention to pray istikhaarah at the same time as intending to pray that\r\n    particular prayer, this is fine, but not if he did not have this intention.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The wisdom behind putting the salaat before the\r\n    du&#146;aa&#146; is that istikhaarah is intended to combine the goodness of this world\r\n    with the goodness of the next. A person needs to knock at the door of the King (Allaah),\r\n    and there is nothing more effective for this than prayer, because it contains\r\n    glorification and praise of Allaah, and expresses one's need for Him at all times.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The phrase &#145;then let him say&#146; would seem to imply that the <i>du&#146;aa&#146;<\/i>\r\n    should be said after finishing the prayer, and the word <i>thumma<\/i> (then) probably\r\n    means after reciting all the words of the salaat and before saying <i>salaam<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The phrase &#145;O Allaah, I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your\r\n    knowledge&#146; is explaining &#145;because You know best.&#146; Similarly, &#145;by\r\n    virtue of Your power&#146; most likely means &#145;seeking Your help.&#146; &#145;I seek\r\n    ability&#146; (<i>astaqdiruka<\/i>) means &#145;I ask You to give me the power or ability (<i>qudrah<\/i>)\r\n    to do&#146; whatever is being asked for, or it probably means &#145;I ask You to decree (<i>tuqaddir<\/i>)\r\n    this for me.&#146; So it may mean making it easy.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;I ask You of Your great bounty&#146; refers to the fact that\r\n    Allaah gives out of His great generosity, but no one has the right to His blessings. This\r\n    is the opinion of Ahl al-Sunnah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not&#146;\r\n    refers to the fact that power and knowledge belong to Allaah alone, and the slave has no\r\n    share of them except what Allaah decrees for him.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;O Allaah, if in Your knowledge this matter&#133;&#146; According\r\n    to one report, he should mention it by name. It is apparent from the context that he\r\n    should state it, but it is probably sufficient to be thinking of the matter whilst making\r\n    this du&#146;aa&#146;.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;Then ordain it for me&#146; means &#145;make it happen for\r\n    me&#146; or it may mean &#145;make it easy for me.&#146; <\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;Then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it&#146; means\r\n    &#145;so that my heart will no longer feel attached to it after it has been turned\r\n    away.&#146;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;Make me pleased with it&#146; means &#145;make me content with\r\n    it, so that I will never regret asking for it or be sorry that it happened, because I do\r\n    not know how it will turn out, even if at the time of asking I am pleased with it.&#146;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The secret is that one&#146;s heart should not be attached to the\r\n    matter in question, because that will result in a person becoming restless.

In sharee&rsquo;ah terminology, Istikhaarah means seeking \r\n    guidance (to the right decision), i.e., seeking guidance as to what Allaah \r\n    knows is the best and most appropriate choice, by means of prayer or the \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; narrated concerning Istikhaarah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>2 &ndash; Ruling<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars are unanimously agreed that Istikhaarah is \r\n    Sunnah.

He said: \r\n    &lsquo;If any one of you is deliberating about a decision he has to make, then let \r\n    him pray two rak&rsquo;ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: <i>Allaahumma inni \r\n    astakheeruka bi &lsquo;ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa as&rsquo;aluka min fadlika, \r\n    fa innaka taqdiru wa<\/i> <i>laa aqdir, wa ta&rsquo;lamu wa laa a&rsquo;lam, wa anta \r\n    &lsquo;allaam al-ghuyoob.

It means turning to Allaah and \r\n    seeking to combine the goodness of this world and of the Hereafter. In order \r\n    to achieve that, one has to knock at the door of the King, Allaah, may He be \r\n    glorified, and there is nothing more beneficial in this regard than salaah \r\n    (prayer) and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; (supplication), because they involve venerating Allaah, \r\n    praising Him and expressing one&rsquo;s need for Him. Then after praying \r\n    istikhaarah one should do that which one feels is best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>4 &ndash; Reasons for it:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In what circumstances should one pray istikhaarah? The four \r\n    madhhabs are agreed that istikhaarah is prescribed in cases where a person \r\n    does not know the right decision to make. In matters where it is known \r\n    whether a thing is good or bad, such as acts of worship, doing good deeds, \r\n    sins or evil actions, there is no need to pray istikhaarah in these cases. \r\n    But if a person wants to find out the right time to do something, such as \r\n    whether to do Hajj this year, because there is the possibility of \r\n    encountering an enemy or some tribulation, or whether to go with a certain \r\n    person or not, then he may pray istikhaarah with regard to such decisions. \r\n    But there is no room for Istikhaarah when it comes to things that are \r\n    obligatory, haraam or makrooh. Rather Istikhaarah has to do with things that \r\n    are recommended or permissible. Istikhaarah is not ordinarily required with \r\n    regard to things that are recommended, rather it should be done in cases \r\n    where there is a conflict, i.e., when a person has a choice of two things \r\n    and must decide which one to start with or which one not to do. With regard \r\n    to permissible things, he may pray Istikhaarah as a regular matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>5 &ndash; When should he start praying Istikhaarah?<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The person who wants to pray Istikhaarah should have an open \r\n    mind, and not have decided on a specific course of action. The phrase &ldquo;If \r\n    any one of you is deliberating&rdquo; indicates that Istikhaarah should be prayed \r\n    when one starts to think of the matter, when through the blessing of prayer \r\n    and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; what is good will become clear to him, in contrast to when the \r\n    idea has taken root and his resolve to do it is firm, in which case his \r\n    inclination will sway him, and there is the fear that wisdom may not prevail \r\n    because he is inclined to do that which he has already decided to do. It may \r\n    be that which is meant by deliberation here is resolve, because a passing \r\n    thought does not matter. And a person should not pray istikhaarah except \r\n    when he has decided to do something but does not have a strong inclination \r\n    towards it. Otherwise, if a person were to pray Istikhaarah for every \r\n    thought that crosses his mind, he would never stop and he would waste all \r\n    his time doing that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>6 &ndash; Consulting others before praying istikhaarah<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said: It is mustahabb, before praying istikhaarah, \r\n    to consult someone whom you knows is sincere, caring and has experience, and \r\n    who is trustworthy with regard to his religious commitment and knowledge. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and consult them in the affairs&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:159]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>7 &ndash; What is to be recited in Salaat al-Istikhaarah<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are three opinions as to what should be recited in \r\n    Salaat al-Istikhaarah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The Hanafis, Maalikis and \r\n    Shaafa&rsquo;is said that it is mustahabb, after reciting al-Faatihah, to recite\r\n    <i>Qul yaa ayyuha&rsquo;l-kaafiroon<\/i> in the first rak&rsquo;ah and <i>Qul huwa \r\n    Allaahu ahad<\/i> in the second.&nbsp; Al-Nawawi said, explaining the reason for \r\n    that: It is appropriate to recite these in prayer, to show sincerity and \r\n    expressing your leaving your affairs to Allaah.

The existence of obstacles \r\n  and difficulties is an indication that Allaah is pushing His slave away from \r\n  doing it. This meaning will be very clear when one ponders the meaning of the \r\n  hadeeth of Jaabir concerning al-istikhaarah, where the Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<\/p>\r\n<p>&#147;&#133; O Allaah, if You know this affair &#150; [and \r\n  here he should mention it] &#150; is good for me in relation to my religion, \r\n  my life, and end, then decree and facilitate it for me, and bless me with it, \r\n  and if You know this affair to be ill for me towards my religion, my life, and \r\n  end, then remove it from me and remove me from it, and decree for me what is \r\n  good wherever it be and make me satisfied with such.&#148;<\/p>\r\n<p>Ibn &#145;Allaan &#150; after transmitting the scholarly view \r\n  that the hadeeth of Anas is da&#146;eef (weak) &#150; said: Therefore it was \r\n  said: that after (doing istikhaarah) he should do what he wants (i.e., even \r\n  if he does not feel that sense of being happy), because whatever happens after \r\n  doing istikhaarah is good&#133;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Al-Haafiz Zayn al-Deen \r\n  al-&#145;Iraaqi said (concerning doing something after praying istikhaarah): \r\n  Whatever he does, there will be good in it. This is supported by what is said \r\n  at the end of the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#146;ood according to some of its isnaads: \r\n  &#145;Then let him make his decision.&#146; I (Ibn Hajar) say: I have already \r\n  discussed above and explained that its narrators (i.e., the narrators who added \r\n  the phrase &#145;Then let him make his decision) are da&#146;eef (weak). But \r\n  this is still stronger than the narrator of that hadeeth (i.e., the hadeeth \r\n  which says, &#145;then see what you feel most drawn towards&#146;). (<i>al-Futoohaat \r\n  al-Rabaaniyyah<\/i>, 3\/355-357)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another of the myths that are widespread among people is that \r\n  after praying istikhaarah you should sleep, and whatever good you see in your \r\n  dream that makes you happy means that what you want to do is good and will be \r\n  made easy for you, otherwise it is not good. (This is what the questioner meant \r\n  by saying &#147;gets the message&#148;). There is no saheeh daleel (evidence) \r\n  for this as far as we know.<\/p>\r\n<p>The above does not mean that if you feel happy it is not a \r\n  sign, but this should not be regarded as the only sign about whether or not \r\n  the matter is good. People often make istikhaarah about something they like \r\n  or want to do, so they feel happy about it from the outset.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allaah have \r\n  mercy on him) said concerning the matter of feeling happy about something: if \r\n  he makes istakhaarah, then whatever Allaah makes him feel happy about and makes \r\n  easy for him, this is what Allaah has chosen for him. (<i>Majmoo&#146; \r\n  al-Fataawaa<\/i>, 10\/539).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a difference between making feeling happy the only \r\n  sign and making it one of several signs. There is no set time period for salaat \r\n  al-istikhaarah; it is permissible to repeat it more than once, but there is \r\n  no limit to how many times.

I hope you \r\n    can clarify?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Answer:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Salaat al-istikhaarah is \r\n    done when a person is thinking of something and is hesitant about the \r\n    consequences, so he prays istikhaarah to Allaah, i.e., he asks Allaah for \r\n    the better of the two options: going ahead with it or not doing it. But he \r\n    should not pray istikhaarah with regard to everything, meaning that if a \r\n    person wants to eat lunch he should say, I will pray istikhaarah about it, \r\n    or if he wants to go and pray with the congregation in the mosque he should \r\n    say, I will pray istikhaarah about it. Rather he should pray istikhaarah and \r\n    ask Allaah for guidance about things of which he does not know the \r\n    consequences, such as becoming the imam of a mosque, if he is offered a \r\n    position as imam of a mosque and does not know whether it is better for him \r\n    to become imam or not. So he should pray istikhaarah, because being the imam \r\n    is good in and of itself, but with regard to the consequences, he does not \r\n    know whether he will be able to fulfil the duties of being imam or not, or \r\n    whether he will be able to settle in this mosque or not, or whether he will \r\n    be suitable for this congregation or not, so he is asking for guidance about \r\n    becoming an imam with regard to whether it is good; rather he is praying for \r\n    guidance as to whether it&nbsp; is better in terms of consequences. How often \r\n    does a man become imam of a mosque then he gets tired and does not do his \r\n    duty, and problems with the congregation make him wish that he had not \r\n    become imam. The same applies to marrying a righteous woman; he does not \r\n    know what the consequences will be.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What matters is that in all \r\n    cases where you are hesitant or uncertain, you must turn to Allaah and ask \r\n    Him for the better of the two options.

The \r\n    difference of opinion among the Sahaabah concerning this is not to be \r\n    criticized, because it is Witr, in which Qunoot is prescribed, like the \r\n    latter half, and because it is dhikr that is prescribed in <\/span>Witr, so \r\n    it is prescribed throughout the year like any other dhikr.

Then he said: Ahmad said: Whoever omits to pray Witr \r\n    deliberately is a bad man, whose testimony should not be accepted. He wanted \r\n    to emphasize that it is confirmed because of the ahaadeeth which say that it \r\n    is enjoined and encouraged. End quote from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/827&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars of the \r\n    Standing Committee were asked: Is Witr prayer obligatory, and will the one \r\n    who prays it on some days and not on others be punished for that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Witr prayer is Sunnah mu&rsquo;akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah) which \r\n    the believer should adhere to.

It is prescribed to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs during the day instead if a \r\n    person misses it, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) used to do that, as it was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her) said: If sleep or sickness kept him from praying at night, \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would pray \r\n    twelve rak'ahs during the day. Narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>. The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) usually prayed \r\n    eleven rak&rsquo;ahs at night, saying the salaam after each two rak'ahs then \r\n    praying one rak'ah on its own. But if sleep or sickness kept him from doing \r\n    that, he would pray twelve rak&rsquo;ahs during the day, as &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with her) stated. Based on this, if a person usually prays five \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs at night but he sleeps or misses them for any other reason, it is \r\n    prescribed for him to pray six rak&rsquo;ahs during the day, saying salaam after \r\n    each two rak&rsquo;ahs. If his habit is to pray three rak&rsquo;ahs, then he should pray \r\n    four rak'ahs with two salaams, and if his habit is to pray seven rak&rsquo;ahs, he \r\n    should pray eight with the salaam after each two rak&rsquo;ahs.

The Hanafis \r\n    are of the view that it is obligatory to recite out loud in prayers in which \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan is recited out loud, and to recite silently in prayers in which \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan is recited silently.

So if a person recites what he is required to \r\n    recite, whether it is silent or out loud, he has done what is required.

Similarly if the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; happens \r\n    to fall on a Friday, there is no sin on him if he singles it out for \r\n    fasting, because he is fasting because it is &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; not because it is \r\n    Friday.

If we look at the \r\n    report narrated by Muslim: &ldquo;Do not single out Friday for fasting,&rdquo; we say \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with it, because this man is not singling it out \r\n    as such.

But if he cannot fast on any other \r\n    day, then it may be understood differently, and it may be said that what the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said &ndash; &ldquo;Did you \r\n    fast yesterday&hellip; are you going to fast tomorrow?&rdquo; &ndash; indicates that she was \r\n    able to fast on other days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that if a person singles out Friday for fasting, \r\n    not because it is Friday, but because it is the day when he has free time, \r\n    then it seems in sha Allaah that it is not makrooh, and that there is \r\n    nothing wrong with that.

Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with\r\n    him) said: &ldquo;We fasted Ramadaan with the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) and he did not lead us in qiyaam at all until there were only seven\r\n    days left, when he led us in prayer until a third of the night had passed. When there were\r\n    six days left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were five days left, he led us in\r\n    prayer until half the night had passed. I said, &lsquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I wish that\r\n    you had continued until the end of the night.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;If a man prays with the\r\n    imaam until he finishes, it will be counted as if he prayed the whole night.&rsquo; When\r\n    there were four nights left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were three nights\r\n    left, he brought together his family, his wives and the people, and led us in qiyaam until\r\n    we were afraid that we would miss al-falaah. I asked, &lsquo;What is al-falaah?&rsquo; he\r\n    said, &lsquo;Suhoor. Then he did not lead us in qiyaam for the rest of the\r\n    month.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Saheeh hadeeth reported by the authors of <i>Sunan<\/i>).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason why the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) did not continually lead the people in praying qiyaam in congregation<\/p>\r\n    <p>5 - The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did\r\n    not lead them in qiyaam for the rest of the month because he feared that it would then\r\n    become obligatory, and they would not be able to do it, as is stated in the hadeeth of\r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah reported in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> and elsewhere. Following the death of\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that fear was no longer a\r\n    factor, because Allaah had completed the religion. The reason for not praying qiyaam in\r\n    congregation during Ramadaan no longer applied, and the previous ruling, that\r\n    congregational prayer is something prescribed in Islam, remained in effect. So &lsquo;Umar\r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) revived the practice, as is recorded in <i>Saheeh\r\n    al-Bukhaari<\/i> and elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Women can pray qiyaam in congregation<\/p>\r\n    <p>Women can attend the prayers too, as is stated in the hadeeth of Abu\r\n    Dharr referred to above. Indeed, it is permissible to appoint an imaam just for them,\r\n    apart from the imaam of the men. It was proven that when &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased\r\n    with him) gathered the people to pray qiyaam, he appointed Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b to lead the\r\n    men and Sulaymaan ibn Abi Hathmah to lead the women. &lsquo;Arfajah al-Thaqafi said: &ldquo;\r\n    &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to command the people to\r\n    pray during the night in Ramadaan, and he would appoint an imaam for the men and an imaam\r\n    for the women. I was the imaam for the women.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I say: this is fine in my view so long as the mosque is big enough so\r\n    that they will not disturb one another.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Number of rak&rsquo;ahs of qiyaam<\/p>\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; The number of rak&rsquo;ahs is eleven, and it is preferable in\r\n    our opinion not to exceed this number, following the practice of the Messenger of Allaah\r\n    <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he never did more than that in\r\n    his life. &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was asked about how he\r\n    prayed in Ramadaan. She said, &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) never prayed more than eleven rak&rsquo;ahs (of qiyaam), whether during\r\n    Ramadaan or any other time. He would pray four, and don&rsquo;t ask me how beautiful or how\r\n    long they were. Then he would pray four, and don&rsquo;t ask me how beautiful or how long\r\n    they were. Then he would pray three.&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and\r\n    others).<\/p>\r\n    <p>8- A person may do less than that, even if it is only\r\n    one rak&rsquo;ah of witr, because of the evidence that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did this and spoke about it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to him doing it: &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased\r\n    with her) was asked how many rak&rsquo;ahs the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray in witr? She said, &ldquo;He used to pray\r\n    four and three, or six and three, or ten and three. He never used to pray less than seven,\r\n    or more than thirteen.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and others).<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to him speaking about it, he said:\r\n    &ldquo;Witr is true, so whoever wishes can pray five, and whoever wishes can pray three,\r\n    and whoever wishes can pray one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Reciting Qur&rsquo;aan in qiyaam<\/p>\r\n    <p>9 &ndash; As regards reciting from the Qur&rsquo;aan during qiyaam,\r\n    whether in Ramadaan or at other times, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) did not set a limit or state what was too much or too little. His recitation\r\n    used to vary, sometimes it would be long, at other times short. Sometimes in every\r\n    rak&rsquo;ah he would recite the equivalent of &lsquo;<i>Yaa ayyuha&rsquo;l-muzammil<\/i>,\r\n    which is twenty aayaat; sometimes he would recite the equivalent of fifty aayaat. He used\r\n    to say, &ldquo;Whoever prays at night and reads one hundred aayaat will not be recorded as\r\n    one of the negligent.&rdquo; According to another hadeeth: &ldquo;&hellip;and reads two\r\n    hundred aayaat, will be recorded as one of the devout and sincere believers.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>When he was sick, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) recited the seven long soorahs in his night prayers, i.e., <i>al<\/i>-<i>Baqarah<\/i>,\r\n    <i>Aal &lsquo;Imraan<\/i>, <i>al-Nisaa&rsquo;<\/i>, <i>al-Maa&rsquo;idah<\/i>, <i>al-An&rsquo;aam<\/i>,\r\n    <i>al-A&rsquo;raaf<\/i> and <i>al-Tawbah<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In the account of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan praying behind the Prophet\r\n    <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), in one rak&rsquo;ah he recited <i>al-Baqarah<\/i>,\r\n    <i>al-Nisa&rsquo;<\/i> and <i>Aal &lsquo;Imraan<\/i>, and he recited them in a slow and\r\n    measured tone. It is proven with the soundest (most saheeh) of isnaads that when\r\n    &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) appointed Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b to lead the\r\n    people in praying eleven rak&rsquo;ahs in Ramadaan, Ubayy used to recite aayaat by the\r\n    hundreds, so that the people behind him would be leaning on sticks because the prayers\r\n    were so long, and they did not finish until just before Fajr.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is also reported in a saheeh account that &lsquo;Umar called the\r\n    readers during Ramadaan, and told the fastest of them to recite thirty aayaat, the\r\n    moderate ones to recite twenty-five aayaat, and the slowest ones to recite twenty aayaat.<\/p>\r\n    <p>However, is a person is praying qiyaam by himself, he can make it as\r\n    long as he wishes; if others agree with the imaam, he may also make it as long as he\r\n    wishes. The longer it is, the better, but a person should not go to extremes and spend the\r\n    whole night in qiyaam, except on rare occasions, following the example of the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: &ldquo;The best guidance is the\r\n    guidance of Muhammad.&rdquo; If a person is praying as an imaam, he should make it only as\r\n    long as is easy for the people behind him, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If any of you leads the people in prayer, let him make\r\n    it short, because among them are the young and the old, the weak, and those who have\r\n    pressing needs. But if he is praying alone, let him make it as long as he likes.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The timing of qiyaam<\/p>\r\n    <p>10 &ndash; The time for praying qiyaam is from after &lsquo;Isha until\r\n    Fajr, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &ldquo;Allaah has added one more prayer for you, which is witr, so pray it between Salaat\r\n    al-&lsquo;Isha&rsquo; and Salaat al-Fajr.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>11 &ndash; Praying at the end of the night is better, for those who can\r\n    manage it, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &ldquo;Whoever is afraid that he will not get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr\r\n    at the beginning of the night, but whoever feels that he will be able to get up at the end\r\n    of the night, let him pray witr at the end of the night, for prayer at the end of the\r\n    night is witnessed [by the angels???], and that is better.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>12 &ndash; If it is the matter of choosing between praying in\r\n    congregation at the beginning of the night and praying alone at the end of the night, it\r\n    is preferable to pray with the jamaa&rsquo;ah, because that is counted as if one had prayed\r\n    the whole night through.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is what the Sahaabah did at the time of &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him). &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Qaari said: &ldquo;I went out with\r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab to the mosque one night during Ramadaan, and saw the people\r\n    scattered throughout the mosque, some praying individually, and some praying in small\r\n    groups. He said, &lsquo;By Allaah, I think that if I gathered all of them behind one reader\r\n    it would be better.&rsquo; So he resolved to do that, and he gathered them behind Ubayy ibn\r\n    Ka&rsquo;b. Then I went with him on another night, and the people were all praying behind\r\n    their reader, and &lsquo;Umar said, &lsquo;What a good innovation this is. What they sleep\r\n    and miss &ndash; meaning the latter part of the night &ndash; is better than what they are\r\n    doing,&rsquo; &ndash; the people used to pray qiyaam at the beginning of the night.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Zayd ibn Wahb said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Abd-Allaah used to lead us in prayer in\r\n    Ramadaan, and he used to finish at night.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>13 &ndash; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    forbade praying witr as three rak&rsquo;ahs, and explained this by saying: &ldquo;Do not\r\n    make it resemble Salaat al-Maghrib.&rdquo; Therefore the person who wants to pray three\r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs for witr must find a way to make it different (from Maghrib). There are two\r\n    ways he can do this: either by giving salaam after the first two rak&rsquo;ahs, which is\r\n    the best way; or by not sitting after the first two rak&rsquo;ahs (i.e., praying three\r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs non-stop). And Allaah knows best.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Recitation during three rak&rsquo;ahs of witr<\/p>\r\n    <p>14 &ndash; It is Sunnah to recite <i>Sabbih bi ismi Rabbika\r\n    al-&lsquo;A&rsquo;laa<\/i> in the first rak&rsquo;ah, <i>Qul Yaa ayyuha&rsquo;l-Kaafiroon<\/i>\r\n    in the second rak&rsquo;ah, and <i>Qul Huwa Allaahu ahad<\/i> in the third rak&rsquo;ah.\r\n    Sometimes <i>Qul a&rsquo;oodhu bi Rabbi&rsquo;l-Falaq<\/i> and <i>Qul a&rsquo;oodhu bi\r\n    Rabbi&rsquo;l-Naas<\/i> may be added as well.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was reported in a saheeh report that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) once recited one hundred aayaat of <i>Soorat\r\n    al-Nisa&rsquo;<\/i> in one rak&rsquo;ah of witr.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; al-Qunoot<\/p>\r\n    <p>15 &ndash; A person may also humble himself before Allaah by reciting\r\n    the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; which the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    taught to his grandson al-Hasan ibn &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), which is:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;<i>Allaahumma&rsquo;hdinee fiman hadayta wa &lsquo;aafinee fiman\r\n    &lsquo;aafayta wa tawallanee fiman tawallayta wa baarik lee fimaa a&rsquo;tayta wa qinee\r\n    sharra maa qadayt, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa &lsquo;alayk.

For surety, he\r\n    whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take an enemy is never honored\r\n    and mighty. O our Lord, Blessed and Exalted are You. There is no refuge from You except\r\n    with You).&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>Sometimes one may send blessings on the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and there is nothing wrong with adding other\r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s that are known from the Sunnah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>16 &ndash; There is nothing wrong with reciting Qunoot after\r\n    rukoo&rsquo;, or with adding curses against the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet\r\n    <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or praying for the Muslims in the second\r\n    half of Ramadaan, because it is proven that the imaam used to do this at the time of\r\n    &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). At the end of the hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd\r\n    al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Ubayd al-Qaari mentioned above, it says: &ldquo;&hellip; They used to\r\n    curse the kuffaar in the middle, saying, &lsquo;<i>Allaahumma qaatil al-kafarata alladheena\r\n    yasuddoona &lsquo;an sabeelik wa yukadhdhiboona rusulak wa laa yu&rsquo;minoona bi\r\n    wa&rsquo;dik.

Make them disunited, fill their\r\n    hearts with terror and send Your wrath and punishment against them, O God of Truth).&rdquo;\r\n    Then he would send blessings on the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him), and pray for good for the Muslims as much as he could, and seek forgiveness for the\r\n    believers.<\/p>\r\n    <p>After he had finished cursing the kuffaar, sending blessings on the\r\n    Prophet, seeking forgiveness for the believing men and women and asking for his own needs,\r\n    he would say: &ldquo;<i>Allaahumma iyyaaka na&rsquo;bud wa<\/i> <i>laka nusalli wa najud, wa\r\n    ilayka nas&rsquo;aa wa nahfud, wa narju rahmataka rabbanaa wa nakhaafu &lsquo;adhaabak\r\n    al-jadd.

Indeed, he said, &ldquo;This travelling is exhausting and difficult, so after any one\r\n    of you prays witr, let him pray two rak&rsquo;ahs. If he wakes up, this is fine, otherwise these two rak&rsquo;ahs will be counted for him. <\/p>\r\n    <p>20 &ndash; It is Sunnah to recite <i>Idha zulzilat al-ard<\/i> and <i>Qul yaa ayyuha&rsquo;l-kaafiroon<\/i> in these two rak&rsquo;ahs.\r\n  <\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: From Qiyaam Ramadaan by al-Albaani"},{"id":"5997","question_id":"5997","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>We do not think that the Muslims should be so \r\n    sensitive with regard to issues that are the matter of scholarly differences or make them the cause of division and fitnah among the Muslims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen&nbsp; (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said, when speaking about the matter of one who prays ten rak&rsquo;ahs with the imam, then sits down and waits for Witr and does not complete the \r\n    Taraaweeh prayers with the imam:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It grieves us deeply that we find in the Muslim \r\n    ummah a group which differs concerning matters in which differences of opinion are acceptable, and they take these differences as a means to cause \r\n    division. Differences within the ummah existed at the time of the Sahaabah, yet they remained united. The youth in particular and to all those who \r\n    are committed to Islam must remain united, because they have enemies who are laying in wait.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    4\/225&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Two groups have gone to extremes with regard to this matter. The first group denounced everyone \r\n    who prays more than eleven rak&rsquo;ahs and said that doing so was bid&rsquo;ah. The second group denounced those who do only eleven rak&rsquo;ahs and said that \r\n    they are going against scholarly consensus (ijmaa&rsquo;).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Let us listen to what Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Here we say that we should not go to extremes or \r\n    be negligent. Some people go to extremes in adhering to the number mentioned in the Sunnah, and say that it is not permissible to do more than the \r\n    number mentioned in the Sunnah, and they aggressively denounce those who do more than that, saying that they are sinners.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is undoubtedly wrong. How can they be \r\n    sinners, when the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), upon being asked about night prayers, said that they are to be done \r\n    two by two, and he did not specify any particular number? Of course&nbsp; the one who asked him about the night prayer did not know the number, because \r\n    if he did not know how to do it, it is even more likely that he did not know the number. And he was not one of those who served the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) so that we might say that he knew what happened inside his house. Since the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him how to do it but did not say how many times, it may be understood that the matter is broad in scope, and \r\n    that a person may pray one hundred rak&rsquo;ahs then pray Witr with one rak&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Pray as you have seen me praying&rdquo;, this does not apply in absolute terms even for these people. \r\n    Hence they do not say that a person should pray Witr with five rak&rsquo;ahs sometimes and with seven rak&rsquo;ahs sometimes and with nine rak&rsquo;ahs sometimes. \r\n    If we understand it in absolute terms, then we would have to pray Witr with five rak&rsquo;ahs sometimes and with seven rak&rsquo;ahs sometimes and with nine \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs sometimes. But what is meant by the hadeeth is pray as you have seen me praying with regard to how to pray not how many rak&rsquo;ahs, unless \r\n    there is a text to state what the number is. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whatever the case, a person should not be strict \r\n    with people with regard to a matter that is broad in scope. We have even seen some brothers who are strict on this matter accusing the imams who \r\n    pray more than eleven rak&rsquo;ahs of following bid&rsquo;ah, and they leave the mosque, thus missing out on the reward of which the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever stands with the imam until he finishes (the prayer), the reward of qiyaam al-layl will \r\n    be recorded for him.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 806; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>, 646). Some of them even sit \r\n    down after completing ten rak&rsquo;ahs, thus breaking up the rows of worshippers by sitting there, and sometimes they start talking and disturb the \r\n    people who are praying.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We have no doubt that their intentions are good \r\n    and they are doing their best to come to the right conclusion, but that does not mean that they are correct.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The other group does the opposite. They sternly \r\n    denounce those who pray only eleven rak&rsquo;ahs and say that they have gone against scholarly consensus. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And whoever contradicts and opposes the \r\n    Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&rsquo; way, We shall keep him in the path \r\n    he has chosen, and burn him in Hell &mdash; what an evil destination!&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:115]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>All the generations who came before you only knew the number as twenty-three rak&rsquo;ahs, and they \r\n    denounce anyone who says anything different.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    4\/73-75&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the evidence quoted by those who \r\n    say that it is not permissible to do more than eight rak&rsquo;ahs in Taraaweeh, they quote the hadeeth of Abu Salamah ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan, who asked \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), &ldquo;How did the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) pray during \r\n    Ramadaan?&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;He did not pray more than eleven rak&rsquo;ahs in Ramadaan or at other times.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Prayers at night are \r\n    to be offered two by two (two rak&rsquo;ahs at a time).

This was the view of al-Thawri, Abu Hanfeefah and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i. \r\n    Maalik said it is thirty-six.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/457&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Taraaweeh prayer is Sunnah according to scholarly consensus. Our view is that it is twenty \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs with ten tasleems, and it is permissible to pray it individually or in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/31&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>These are the views of the four imams concerning the number of rak&rsquo;ahs of Taraaweeh prayer. All \r\n    of them said something more than eleven rak&rsquo;ahs. Perhaps the reasons why they said something more than eleven rak&rsquo;ahs include the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>They thought that the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah did not mean that this was the specific number.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>A greater number was narrated from many of the salaf.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/604; <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    4\/32&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray eleven rak&rsquo;ahs and make \r\n    them very lengthy, so much so that it used to take him most of the night. Indeed, one night in which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) led his companions in praying Taraaweeh, he did not end his prayer until just before dawn, and the Sahaabah feared that they \r\n    would miss suhoor. The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) loved to pray behind the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) and they did not feel that it was too long. The scholars thought that if the imam made the prayer so long, this would be too difficult for \r\n    the members of the congregation and that might put them off. So they thought that the imam should make the recitation shorter and increase the \r\n    number of rak&rsquo;ahs.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The point is that the one who prays eleven \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs in the manner narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is doing well and is following the Sunnah. \r\n    Whoever makes the recitation shorter and increases the number of rak&rsquo;ahs is also doing well. A person who does either of these two things is not \r\n    to be denounced. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;If a person prays Taraaweeh according to the \r\n    madhhabs of Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad, with twenty rak&rsquo;ahs, or according to the madhhab of Maalik, with thirty-six rak&rsquo;ahs, or with \r\n    thirteen or eleven rak&rsquo;ahs, he has done well, as Imam Ahmad said, because there is nothing to specify the number. So the greater or lesser number \r\n    of rak&rsquo;ahs depends on how long or short the qiyaam (standing in the prayer) is.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i>, p. \r\n    64&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Suyooti said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What is narrated in the saheeh and hasan \r\n    ahaadeeth is the command to observe night prayers during Ramadaan, which is encouraged without specifying a particular number. It is not proven \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed twenty rak&rsquo;ahs of Taraaweeh, rather that he prayed at night, with an \r\n    unspecified number of rak&rsquo;ahs. Then he delayed it on the fourth night lest it become obligatory for them and they might not be able to do it. Ibn \r\n    Hajar al-Haythami said: There is no saheeh report that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed twenty rak&rsquo;ahs of \r\n    Taraaweeh. The narration which suggests that he &ldquo;used to pray twenty rak&rsquo;ahs&rdquo; is extremely weak (da&rsquo;eef).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, \r\n    27\/142-145&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So you should not be surprised that people pray Taraaweeh as twenty rak&rsquo;ahs. There have been \r\n    generation after generation of those imams (who used to pray twenty rak&rsquo;ahs), and all of them are good. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"5998","question_id":"5998","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Before answering this question, we would like \r\n    to say that we appreciate your eagerness to follow the Sunnah, and we ask Allaah to make us and you among those who listen to the word and follow \r\n    it properly. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What you have said &ndash; may Allaah guide you &ndash; \r\n    about not wanting to make Witr resemble Maghrib by raising your hands for the Takbeer before reciting Du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; al-Qunoot, is not what is meant by \r\n    the prohibition of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the hadeeth narrated by al-Haakim (1\/304), al-Bayhaqi (3\/31) \r\n    and al-Daaraqutni (p. 172), and which was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim.
