How to confirm the beginning and end of Ramadan What counts with regard to confirming the beginning of the month of Ramadan is sighting of the new moon or the completion of 30 days of Sha`ban if the moon is not sighted. This is what is indicated by the authentic Sunnah, and the scholars unanimously agreed on it. Al-Bukhari (1909) and Muslim (1081) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it ( the new moon ) and break the fast when you see it, and if it is cloudy then reckon the month as thirty.",

We should point out that discussion with the kuffaar about matters of Islam should only be undertaken by specialists, lest one of them instil doubts in the mind of the Muslim who wants to call them and he becomes confused as to how to answer them. Although we appreciate your sending his question to us and not answering him yourself, we advise you – and those who call others to Allaah in general – not to give the kuffaar the opportunity to debate minor practical issues.",
