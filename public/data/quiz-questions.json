So if someone says, for example, that So and so did not do such and such, because he is certain or he thinks it most likely that he did not do it, because of what he knows about his religious commitment or attitude, or about his situation that would prevent him from doing that, then he is swearing on the basis of what he thinks is most likely in his view.",
