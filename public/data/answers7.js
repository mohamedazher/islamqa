There is no \r\n    reason to suggest it is not allowed. What is required is to strive hard in \r\n    the last ten days according to one's ability. If a person breaks up his \r\n    night between prayer, resting, sleeping, and reading Qur'aan, then he has \r\n    done well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah Abaabateen said, as is narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Durar al-Saniyyah<\/i> (4\/364):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In response to what some people do of objecting to the one \r\n    who prays more during the last ten days of Ramadan than he usually did in \r\n    the first twenty days, on the grounds that this is more than is usual and is \r\n    ignorance of the Sunnah and the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi&rsquo;een and \r\n    imams of Islam,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We say: There are hadeeths from the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) which encourage praying Qiyaam al-layl during \r\n    Ramadan, and particularly emphasise it during the last ten days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once it becomes clear that there is no specific number of \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs for Taraweeh, and that the time for it according to all scholars is \r\n    from after the Sunnah of &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; until the break of dawn, and that spending \r\n    the night in worship is a confirmed Sunnah, and that the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allaah be upon him) prayed taraweeh for many nights in \r\n    congregation, then how can anyone object to the one who prays more during \r\n    the last ten nights than he did at the beginning of the month? So during the \r\n    last ten days, he prays at the beginning of the night, as he did at the \r\n    beginning of the month, or a little, or a lot, without praying Witr, for the \r\n    sake of those who are weak and want to limit themselves to that; then after \r\n    that he does more prayers in congregation and calls all of it qiyaam or \r\n    taraweeh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps the one who objects to that is confused by what many \r\n    of the fuqaha&rsquo; say, that it is mustahabb for the imam not to pray more than \r\n    one includes than one khatmah (reading of the entire Qur&rsquo;aan), unless the \r\n    people behind him prefer to do more than that. The reason they gave for not \r\n    doing more than one khatmah is the hardship that may be caused for the \r\n    people behind him, not because doing more than that is not prescribed in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. So from their wording we may conclude that if people behind him \r\n    want to do more than one khatmah, that is good, as was clearly stated in the \r\n    words of the scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for what many of the common people say, calling what is \r\n    done at the beginning of the night Taraweeh and the prayers offered after \r\n    that qiyaam, this is what the uneducated people say. Rather all of it is \r\n    qiyaam and taraweeh. The qiyaam of Ramadaan is called Taraweeh because they \r\n    used to have a rest (yastareehoona) after every four rak&rsquo;ahs because they \r\n    used to make the prayers lengthy. The reason why some people object to that \r\n    is that it is contrary to what is customary among the people of their \r\n    countries and most of the people nowadays; and because of ignorance of the \r\n    Sunnah and reports and of the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi&rsquo;oon and the \r\n    imams of Islam; and because of what some people think, that our prayer \r\n    during the last ten days is a kind of salat al-ta&rsquo;qeeb which was regarded as \r\n    makrooh by some scholars, but that is not in fact the case, because ta&rsquo;qeeb \r\n    is a voluntary prayer offered in congregation after finishing Taraweeh and \r\n    Witr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is how all the fuqaha&rsquo; defined ta&rsquo;qeeb, as a voluntary \r\n    prayer offered in congregation after finishing Witr immediately after \r\n    Taraweeh. From these words it is clear that prayer offered in congregation \r\n    before Witr is not ta&rsquo;qeeb. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said in <i>Ithaaf Ahl al-Eemaan bi \r\n    Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the last ten days of Ramadan, the Muslims increase their \r\n    efforts in worship, following the example of the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking Laylat al-Qadr which is better than \r\n    a thousand months. Those who pray twenty-three rak&rsquo;ahs at the beginning of \r\n    the month break it up during the last ten days, so they pray ten rak&rsquo;ahs at \r\n    the beginning of the night, calling it Taraweeh, and they pray ten at the \r\n    end of the night, making them lengthy, and following it with three rak&rsquo;ahs \r\n    of Witr, which they call qiyaam. This is a variation in naming only. In fact \r\n    all of it may be called Taraweeh or it may be called qiyaam. As for those \r\n    who pray eleven or thirteen rak&rsquo;ahs at the beginning of the month, they add \r\n    ten rak&rsquo;ahs to that during the last ten days, which they pray at the end of \r\n    the night, making it lengthy, making the most of the virtue of the last ten \r\n    days and increasing their efforts to do good. They have a precedent among \r\n    the Sahaabah and others who prayed twenty-three rak&rsquo;ahs, as stated above. \r\n    Thus they combine the two opinions: the opinion which favours offering \r\n    thirteen rak&rsquo;ahs during the first twenty days and the opinion which favours \r\n    offering twenty-three during the last ten days.

So the prostration of recitation is Sunnah and \r\n    is not obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the verses are repeated, such as when one repeats the \r\n    verses for the purpose of memorising Qur&rsquo;aan, doing the prostration the \r\n    first time will suffice for the rest and there is no need to repeat the \r\n    prostration. But if he is reading Soorat al-Hajj, for example, (in which \r\n    there are two sajdahs) and he does the first prostration then he comes to \r\n    the second prostration, he may prostrate again even if the interval was not \r\n    long.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 14\/318&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6032","question_id":"6032","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fuqaha&rsquo; differed \r\n    concerning how the Ameen is to be said by the one who is praying behind an \r\n    imam in Qunoot al-nawaazil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Hanafis are of the view \r\n    that there is no Ameen in Qunoot al-nawaazil, because the Qunoot should be \r\n    recited silently unless the imam recites Qunoot out loud.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Shaafa&rsquo;is and Hanbalis \r\n    are of the view that the Ameen should be said out loud in Qunoot \r\n    al-nawaazil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>According to the Maalikis, \r\n    Qunoot al-nawaazil is not prescribed in the first place, and the Ameen \r\n    belongs to the Qunoot; if the thing it belongs to is cancelled then it is \r\n    cancelled too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See: <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (1\/116).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>Mughni \r\n    al-Mughtaaj<\/i> (1\/362): Note: The one who is praying behind the imam should \r\n    speak out loud in five places: four places of saying Ameen: he should say \r\n    Ameen with the imam (i.e., after he recites al-Faatihah); in his du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; when \r\n    he recites the morning Qunoot; in Qunoot of Witr in the second half of \r\n    Ramadaan; and in Qunoot an-Naazilah (Qunoot of calamity) in the five daily \r\n    prayers; and if the imam makes a mistake in his recitation and a person \r\n    praying behind him corrects him.

There is a difference of \r\n    opinion among the scholars concerning this. Some of them say that there must \r\n    be a sound that he can hear himself. This is the correct view; even if those \r\n    who are next to him cannot hear him, he has to be able to hear himself. If \r\n    he speaks without hearing himself, then there is no point in forming these \r\n    words. But this view is weak. The correct view is that it is not essential \r\n    that he be able to hear himself, because hearing is something extra to \r\n    saying and speaking, and if something is extra to what is mentioned in the \r\n    Sunnah, then the one who says that has to produce evidence for it. Based on \r\n    that, if a person is certain that he has pronounced the words properly, but \r\n    he did not hear himself, either because his hearing is weak or because of \r\n    noise going on around him, or for some other reason, then the correct view \r\n    is that all his words are acceptable and he does not have to do more than \r\n    what is indicated by the texts, which is speaking.

So every text that mentions du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; at the end of the prayer is \r\n    to be understood as referring to the last part of it, so that the du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n    will be at the point where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) taught us to offer du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;, unless interpreting the text in this manner \r\n    is impossible or unlikely, according to the context, in which case it is to \r\n    be understood as indicated by the context.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The \r\n    words &ldquo;repeat al-Faatihah&rdquo; mean repeating it twice or more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason for that is that it was not narrated from the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he did that. If a \r\n    person repeats al-Faatihah as an act of worship, there is no doubt that it \r\n    is makrooh, because if doing so were good, the Prophet (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) would have done it. But if a person repeats al-Fatihah \r\n    not as an act of worship, but because he did not do it in the recommended \r\n    manner, it seems that it is permissible, such as repeating it because he \r\n    forgot and recited it silently when it is prescribed to recite it out loud, \r\n    as happens to some imams who forget and recite al-Faatihah silently. In this \r\n    case we say: There is nothing wrong with repeating it from the beginning in \r\n    order to make up for what was omitted of reciting out loud. The same applies \r\n    if one recites it without focus and wants to repeat it whilst focusing on \r\n    the second recitation; in this case repeating it has a legitimate purpose, \r\n    which is to focus with presence of mind. But if there is the fear that this \r\n    will open the door to waswaas, one should not do it, because for some \r\n    people, if they open this door they will face a great deal of waswaas and \r\n    when they recite it, if they are careless in one verse they will repeat it. \r\n    Then if they lose focus when repeating it, they will lose focus a second \r\n    time, and a third and a fourth and so on, and then things will become very \r\n    hard on him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i>, 3\/331.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6041","question_id":"6041","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is permissible to prostrate on soft surfaces like blankets \r\n    etc., so long as the worshipper can place his forehead and nose firmly on \r\n    the surface when prostrating.

Rather this is what is prescribed and is what the Imams enjoined, as \r\n    it is proven in <i>as-Saheeh<\/i> that the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said to Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith and his companion: &ldquo;When \r\n    the time for prayer comes, give the adhaan (call to prayer) and the iqaamah \r\n    (call immediately preceding the prayer), let one of you lead the other in \r\n    prayer and pray as you have seen me praying.&rdquo; And it is proven in <i>\r\n    as-Saheeh<\/i> that he used to recite in Fajr prayer something between sixty \r\n    and one hundred verses, which is between approximately one third and one \r\n    half of a juz&rsquo;, of which there are thirty. So he would recite the lengthy \r\n    soorahs of al-mufassal such as Qaaf (50), &ldquo;Alif-Laam-Meem tanzeel&rdquo;, and \r\n    al-Mulk (67); and he would recite Soorat al-Mu&rsquo;minoon (23), as-Saaffaat (37) \r\n    and so on&hellip; And sometimes he would make it brief, either because he was \r\n    travelling or for some other reason, as he (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;I may start to pray, intending to make it lengthy, then I \r\n    hear the crying of a child so I make it brief because of what I know of his \r\n    mother&rsquo;s concern for him.&rdquo; And it was narrated from him that he used to \r\n    recite in Fajr Soorat at-Takweer (81) and Soorat az-Zalzalah (99). So the \r\n    imam should usually do what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) usually used to do, then if there is a purpose to be served by \r\n    making it longer than that or shorter than that, then he should do so, as \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sometimes used to do \r\n    more than that or less than that.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>End quote from \r\n    Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    22\/318<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And Allah knows best<\/span><span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6048","question_id":"6048","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) is that when he had finished praying, he would ask Allah for \r\n    forgiveness three times, then he would say: &ldquo;<i>Allaahumma anta as-salaam wa \r\n    minka al-salaam, tabaarakta yaa dhaa&rsquo;l-jalaali wa&rsquo;l-ikraam<\/i> (O Allah, You \r\n    are as-Salaam (the One Who is free from all defects and deficiencies) and \r\n    from You is all peace, blessed are You, Possessor of majesty and honour).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is based on what has been explained previously in the \r\n    answer to question no.

For \r\n    example, covering the face is an issue concerning which the scholars \r\n    differed, but there is no one who says that it is haraam to cover the face. \r\n    If she thinks that it is acceptable to uncover the face, he has the right to \r\n    prevent her from showing it before non-mahrams, and he has the right to make \r\n    her follow his opinion, which is that it is obligatory to cover the face &ndash; \r\n    which is the more correct view &ndash; and she does not have the right to go \r\n    against him. She will be rewarded for doing that if she seeks reward for \r\n    obeying her Lord by obeying her husband and does that which is more \r\n    concealing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Whatever the wife thinks is obligatory, haraam or bid&rsquo;ah \r\n    (innovation), she does not have to obey the husband by refraining from what \r\n    is obligatory or by doing that which is haraam or bid&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have mentioned above an example of something that is \r\n    obligatory, namely zakaah on gold. An example of something that the wife \r\n    thinks is haraam and that the husband thinks is permissible is covering the \r\n    face &ndash; the opposite of the scenario mentioned above. If she thinks that it \r\n    is haraam to uncover her face in front of non-mahram men, her husband does \r\n    not have the right to tell her to uncover it on the basis that he thinks it \r\n    is permissible for her to uncover her face.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Can I disobey my husband if he asks me to uncover my face in \r\n    front of non-mahrams? Do the words &ldquo;There is no obedience to any created \r\n    being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator&rdquo; apply in this case? \r\n    Please note that there is a difference of opinion among the scholars \r\n    concerning the ruling on covering the face. Is it permissible for me to \r\n    uncover my face when I am in my house if my husband&rsquo;s male relatives are \r\n    present, or when I open the door for the electrician or gas technician, or \r\n    when I go out on the balcony to hang out laundry, if I wear full hijab \r\n    without covering the face?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;It is haraam for the wife to obey her husband with regard to \r\n    something that Allaah has forbidden, because there is no obedience to any \r\n    created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. That includes \r\n    uncovering the face in front of non-mahram men, whether they are his \r\n    relatives or her relatives or anyone else, inside the house, outside the \r\n    house, and on the balcony, or when opening the door to the electrician or \r\n    guests.

Allaah is the All-Knowing, Who encompasses \r\n    all things by His knowledge, and He is the All-Wise Who does not prescribe \r\n    anything except for a reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the reason behind the prescription of zakaah, \r\n    the scholars have mentioned many reasons for it, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; To complete and perfect a person&rsquo;s Islam, because it is \r\n    one of the pillars of Islam. If a person fulfils it, his Islam is complete. \r\n    Undoubtedly this is an important aim for every Muslim, and every believing \r\n    Muslim will strive to perfect his faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It is indicative of a person&rsquo;s sincerity of faith, \r\n    because wealth is dear to people, and something that is loved will not be \r\n    given up except for something that is equally or more loved, or rather for \r\n    something that is more loved. Hence it is called sadaqah, because it is \r\n    indicative of the sincerity (sidq) of a person&rsquo;s desire to please Allaah, \r\n    may He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; It cleanses the character of the one who gives it, so \r\n    that he is saved from being a miser and is included among the generous, \r\n    because if he accustoms himself to giving, whether it is giving knowledge or \r\n    giving wealth or using his position to help others, that giving will become \r\n    a characteristic for him and will be part of his nature, until he gets upset \r\n    if there is a day when he does not give. Like the hunter who gets used to \r\n    hunting, if one day he does not hunt, you will find him feeling anxious. \r\n    Similarly the one who has gotten used to being generous will feel anxious if \r\n    he does not give some of his wealth or use his position to help others one \r\n    day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; It gladdens the \r\n    heart. If a person gives something, especially wealth, he feels a sense of \r\n    joy. This is something that is tried and tested, but it is subject to the \r\n    condition that he gives gladly and willingly, not grudgingly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim said in <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> that giving and \r\n    generosity are means of gladdening the heart, but no one benefits from that \r\n    except the one who gives gladly and willingly, and gives the wealth from his \r\n    heart before he gives it from his hand. As for the one who gives from his \r\n    hand but his heart is still attached to the wealth, his heart, he will never \r\n    benefit from that giving.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; It joins a person to the ranks of the true believers. \r\n    &ldquo;None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for \r\n    himself.&rdquo; Just as you love to be given money with which you can meet your \r\n    needs, you should also love to give it to your brother, thereby you will \r\n    perfect your faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; It is one of the means of entering Paradise, because \r\n    Paradise is for the one who &ldquo;speaks good words, spreads (the greeting of) \r\n    salaam, feeds the hungry and prays at night when the people are asleep.&rdquo; And \r\n    all of us are striving to enter Paradise.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; It makes the Muslim society like a single family, in \r\n    which those who have the means show compassion to those who do not have the \r\n    means, and the rich to those who are in hardship. Thus a person feels that \r\n    he has brothers to whom he must do good as Allaah has been good to him. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and do good as Allaah has been good to you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Qasas 28:77]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the Muslim ummah becomes like a single family. This is \r\n    what is known nowadays as &ldquo;social security&rdquo;, but zakaah is better than that, \r\n    because a person is paying it as an obligatory duty and benefitting his \r\n    brothers thereby.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; It extinguishes the flames of revolution among the poor, \r\n    for a poor man may be provoked by finding a man who can ride whatever kind \r\n    of vehicle he wants, and live in whatever kind of palace he wants, and eat \r\n    whatever kind of food he wants, whereas he has no means of transportation \r\n    but his own two feet, and can sleep only on the ground, and so on, so \r\n    undoubtedly he will feel some kind of resentment in his heart.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the rich are generous to the poor, they will prevent \r\n    rebellion and soothe their anger and they will say: we have brothers who \r\n    acknowledge us at times of hardship, so they will feel love towards the \r\n    rich.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;9 &ndash; It prevents financial crimes such as robbery and \r\n    stealing and the like, because the poor will get enough to meet their needs, \r\n    and they will excuse the rich because they are giving them some of their \r\n    wealth, and they will see that they are treating them well, so they will not \r\n    transgress against them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10 &ndash; Salvation from the heat of the Day of Resurrection. The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Every man \r\n    will be in the shade of his charity on the Day of Resurrection.&rdquo; Classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i> (4510). And he listed among \r\n    those whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no \r\n    shade but His: &ldquo;&hellip; a man who gives charity and conceals it so much that his \r\n    left hand does not know what his right hand is doing.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    11 &ndash; It leads a man to learn about the laws of Allaah, \r\n    because he can never pay his zakaah until he has learned the rulings on \r\n    zakaah, the kinds of wealth that are subject to zakaah and those who are \r\n    entitled to receive it, and other information that he needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>12 &ndash; It purifies wealth, \r\n    so that the wealth will grow literally and metaphorically. If a person gives \r\n    charity from his wealth, that this will protect him from problems, and \r\n    Allaah may increase his provision because of his giving charity. Hence it \r\n    says in the hadeeth: &ldquo;Wealth never decreases because of charity.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by Muslim, 2588. This is something that is tried and tested, because a \r\n    miser&rsquo;s wealth may be overtaken by something that destroys it or most of it, \r\n    such as fire, and great losses, or sickness that forces him to seek \r\n    treatment which takes up much of his wealth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    13 &ndash; It is a means of bringing down blessings. In the hadeeth \r\n    it says: &ldquo;No people ever withhold the zakaah of their wealth but rain is \r\n    withheld from the sky.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    5204.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    14 &ndash; &ldquo;Charity given in secret extinguishes the wrath of the \r\n    Lord,&rdquo; as was narrated from the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 3759.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>15 &ndash; It wards off a bad \r\n    death.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;16 &ndash; It wrestles with the calamity that comes down from \r\n    heaven and prevents it reaching earth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    17 &ndash; It expiates for sins.

No zakaah is due on shares in \r\n    these companies, because the value of these shares is based on equipment, \r\n    tools, buildings, furnishings and so on, which are needed in order to do the \r\n    work, and there is no zakaah on these things. Rather zakaah is due on the \r\n    profits of these shares if it reaches the nisaab and one year has passed.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Companies which engage only in \r\n    trade (commercial companies).<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Companies which engage both in \r\n    manufacturing and trade.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Companies which engage only in trade are those which buy \r\n    goods and sell them without doing anything to change them, such as \r\n    import\/export companies, and international trade companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for companies which engage both in manufacturing and \r\n    trade, these are companies that combine both activities, such as companies \r\n    that extract or buy raw materials, subject them to some changes, then trade \r\n    in them, like petroleum companies, textile companies, metal companies, \r\n    chemical companies, and so on. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Zakaah must be paid on shares in these two types of companies \r\n    (those that engage in trade only and those that engage in manufacturing and \r\n    trade), after deducting the value of the buildings, tools, and equipment \r\n    owned by these companies.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The net value of the buildings and equipment may be worked \r\n    out by referring to the company&rsquo;s annual budget.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Agricultural companies<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In this case, zakaah is due on the crops and produce &ndash; if the \r\n    produce is of the type on which zakaah is due. So it should be worked out \r\n    what each share is worth in terms of crops and produce, then the share-owner \r\n    must pay zakaah on it. He should pay one-tenth if the crops are irrigated \r\n    naturally and half of one-tenth if they are irrigated artificially, subject \r\n    to the condition that the shares reach the nisaab, which is 300 saa&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The above is based on the assumption that the factories, \r\n    buildings such as hotels, and cars etc that are used by the company are not \r\n    subject to zakaah, except the zakaah that is due on any profits made, if it \r\n    reaches the nisaab and one year has passed. This has already been discussed \r\n    in the answer to question no. [fatin]74987[\\fatin]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This second view is more correct, because a share is a part \r\n    of the company, so it comes under the same rulings with regard to zakaah, \r\n    whether the company is involved in manufacturing, trade or agriculture.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This was the view of Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan &lsquo;Eesa in his book\r\n    <i>al-Mu&rsquo;aamalaat al-Hadeethah wa Ahkaamuha<\/i>; and Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    al-Bassaam and Dr. Wahbah al-Zuhayri, as stated in <i>Majallat al-Majma&rsquo; \r\n    al-Fiqhi<\/i>, 4\/742.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bassaam stated that differentiating between commercial and \r\n    manufacturing companies is the view of the majority.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majallat al-Majma&rsquo; al-Fiqhi<\/i>, \r\n    4\/1\/725&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Note:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It should be noted that \r\n    manufacturing and agricultural companies also have cash reserves, and there \r\n    is no dispute that zakaah is due on this money. It should be worked out what \r\n    each share is worth of this money, and the shareowner should pay zakaah on \r\n    that, if it reaches the nisaab by itself, or if it reaches the nisaab when \r\n    added to his own money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of Dr. &lsquo;Ali al-Saloos, as stated in <i>\r\n    Majallat al-Majma&rsquo; al-Fiqhi<\/i>, 4\/1\/849&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen \r\n    also drew attention to this when he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person has bought these shares for the purpose of trade \r\n    &ndash; meaning that he buys these shares today and will sell them in the future \r\n    whenever he can make a profit &ndash; then he must pay zakaah on these shares \r\n    every year, and pay zakaah on any profit that he makes. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if these shares are for the purpose of investment, and he \r\n    does not intend to sell them, then it depends. If they are money &ndash; gold, \r\n    silver or cash money &ndash; then zakaah must be paid on them, because zakaah is \r\n    due on cash, gold and silver and must be paid every year.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In that case he should ask those who are in charge of this \r\n    institution what money they have in their reserve.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the wealth is in the \r\n    form of a product or other benefits, other than gold, silver or cash, then \r\n    no zakaah is due on it, rather zakaah is due on any profits that are made, \r\n    when one year has passed since taking possession of it.

But if they did not authorize him to pay the zakaah, then he should \r\n    not do so; but he has to inform the shareholders of its value at the time \r\n    when zakaah becomes due, so that each of them may pay the zakaah on his \r\n    shares by himself, or authorize him to pay the zakaah.

Zakaah is also due on the value of shares in \r\n    the company&rsquo;s cash reserves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Is the zakaah due from \r\n    the company in which shares are held or from the shareholders?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some researchers are of the view that zakaah on shares is due \r\n    from the company. They quote as evidence the fact that the company is an \r\n    independent entity which has the power to dispose of its wealth, and zakaah \r\n    is a duty that has to do with the wealth, hence no conditions have been \r\n    stipulated concerning being an adult and of sound mind with regard to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The response to that is that even though the company is an \r\n    independent entity, that does not mean that zakaah is enjoined upon it, \r\n    because other conditions of zakaah being obligatory are that one should be a \r\n    Muslim and be free (as opposed to being a slave), etc. These are attributes \r\n    that cannot be applied to a company. Moreover, the company&rsquo;s ownership of \r\n    the wealth is on behalf of the shareholders, so basically the shareholders \r\n    are the owners, not the company. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They also quoted as evidence the analogy with owning shares \r\n    in an an&rsquo;aam animal (camel, cow, etc), because the zakaah is due on the \r\n    shared wealth as a whole, not on the wealth of each partner individually.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer to this is that the fact that zakaah is due on \r\n    combined flocks does not mean that the zakaah is obligatory upon this \r\n    partnership as a separate entity, rather what it means is that the wealth of \r\n    the partners is added together and the zakaah is worked out like the zakaah \r\n    of a single person.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The majority of scholars are of the view that zakaah is \r\n    obligatory upon the shareholder &ndash; and this is the correct view &ndash; because the \r\n    shareholder is the true owner of the money, and the company handles his \r\n    shares on his behalf according to the conditions stipulated in the company&rsquo;s \r\n    regulations. And zakaah is an act of worship which requires an intention \r\n    (niyyah) when it is done; there is reward for paying it and punishment for \r\n    withholding it, and this is inconceivable in the case of shareholding \r\n    companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h2>\r\n    Who should pay zakaah on shares &ndash; the company or the \r\n    shareholder?&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that the one who should pay zakaah on \r\n    shares is the owner of the shares himself, because the owner is the one who \r\n    is obliged to pay his zakaah. But there is nothing wrong with the company \r\n    paying zakaah on behalf of shareholders. The Fiqh Council has stated that \r\n    there is no reason why a company cannot pay zakaah on behalf of shareholders \r\n    in four cases:&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If that is stated in the \r\n    basic regulations, or if a decision to that effect is issued by the general \r\n    membership, or if the law of the state obliges companies to pay zakaah, or \r\n    if the shareholder delegates the company to pay zakaah on his shares. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majallat al-Majma&rsquo; al-Fiqhi<\/i>, \r\n    4\/1\/881&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h2>\r\n    Rate of zakaah on shares&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Zakaah on shares in companies is one-quarter of one-tenth, \r\n    i.e., 2.5%, whether the owner intends to trade in them or keep them for the \r\n    sake of their annual profit, because if they are for the purpose of trade, \r\n    then they are trade goods, and the zakaah on trade goods is one-quarter of \r\n    one-tenth. If they are bought in order to be kept so that one may benefit \r\n    from the annual profit, then they are like real estate that is rented out, \r\n    and the zakaah on rent for property is one-quarter of one-tenth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h2>\r\n    When does the year for shares begin?&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to shares in commercial companies or shares that \r\n    a person deals in, the profits are connected to the capital with regard to \r\n    the year (for calculating zakaah), because a new year cannot be started for \r\n    the profits on trade, rather the year starts when the wealth was originally \r\n    acquired, if the original wealth reached the nisaab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/75&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It must be noted that if \r\n    trade goods are bought with gold, silver or cash, a new year cannot be \r\n    started for them from the time of purchase, rather the year should continue \r\n    from the time when the money with which they were bought was acquired, if it \r\n    reaches the nisaab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Note that the year for trade goods does \r\n    not come one year after buying them, rather it comes one year after the \r\n    original wealth was acquired, because trade goods are a form of money and \r\n    part of your capital which you turned into trade goods, so the year starts \r\n    from the time you acquired the wealth with which you bought the trade \r\n    goods.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    18\/234&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]32715[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to manufacturing companies and those whose shares \r\n    are kept for the purpose of investment and earning the annual profit, not \r\n    for trade, zakaah is due on the profits of these shares if the profit on its \r\n    own reaches the nisaab, or if it reaches the nisaab when added to the money \r\n    that a person has.

That must be the basis for \r\n    loving and hating, giving and withholding, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever gives for the sake of Allaah \r\n    and withholds for the sake of Allaah, loves for the sake of Allaah and hates \r\n    for the sake of Allaah, and gets married for the sake of Allaah, has \r\n    perfected his faith.&rdquo; Ahmad, 1519; al-Tirmidhi, 2521; Abu Dawood, 4681; \r\n    classed as hasan by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>People vary with regard \r\n    to faith and Islam.

Thus each person varies in the degree to which he is entitled to the \r\n    rights of friendship, depending on the degree of his religious commitment, \r\n    although they all come under the general heading of the friendship that is \r\n    required in Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said in <i>al-Fataawa<\/i>, 28\/209:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah sent the Messengers and revealed the Books so that the \r\n    religion (worship) would all be for Allaah, so that love would be for His \r\n    close friends and hate for His enemies; so that His close friends would be \r\n    honoured and His enemies humiliated; so that the reward would be for His \r\n    close friends and the punishment would be for His enemies.

So the reasons \r\n    for honouring and humiliating may coexist in a person; both may coexist in \r\n    him &ndash; such as a poor thief whose hand is cut off for stealing, but he is \r\n    given enough from the bayt al-maal (treasury) to meet his needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the basic principle upon which Ahl al-Sunnah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah are agreed&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer to this question is based on this general \r\n    principle. Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is some bid&rsquo;ah for which a person may be excused, there \r\n    is some which reaches the degree of fisq (evildoing) and there is some that \r\n    reaches the degree of kufr. With regard to those who follow bid&rsquo;ah that \r\n    constitutes kufr, it is not permissible to help them at all, even if they \r\n    call themselves Muslims, because their calling themselves Muslims whilst \r\n    they persist in that bid&rsquo;ah that constitutes kufr, even after evidence has \r\n    been established against them, means that they are akin to the hypocrites \r\n    who said, &ldquo;we bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allaah,&rdquo; but Allaah \r\n    said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Allaah knows that you \r\n    are indeed His Messenger, and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are \r\n    liars indeed&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Munaafiqoon 63:1]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to innovation that constitutes fisq (evildoing), \r\n    or for which a person may have a justifiable excuse, the fact that they \r\n    follow bid&rsquo;ah does not mean that we are not allowed to help them. They \r\n    should be helped against their kaafir enemies because they are undoubtedly \r\n    better than those kuffaar. <i>Al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i>, 1\/66&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But they should be \r\n    prevented from spending this money on establishing or propagating their \r\n    bid&rsquo;ahs. If it is known or it is thought most likely that they will use that \r\n    money to support their bid&rsquo;ahs, and they cannot be stopped from doing so, \r\n    and they will not spend it on permissible things that they need, then they \r\n    should not be given any of this money, because that entails helping them in \r\n    their sin.

It is also permissible to make \r\n    use of what is in the earth; and riba (usury, interest), gambling and zulm \r\n    (wrongdoing, oppression) are all forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the forms of economic activity that are based on these \r\n    foundations are: permissible financial transactions, partnerships, \r\n    mudaarabah (partnership whereby one supplies capital and another provides \r\n    labour), renting, muzaara&rsquo;ah (where one person supplies land and another \r\n    cultivates it), and various forms of permissible investment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As zakaah is a means of money passing from the hands of one \r\n    person to another, who may benefit from it and dispose of it, and this is \r\n    regulated by the general principles that are derived from the Qur&rsquo;aan and \r\n    Sunnah, we may say that in this sense zakaah is indeed a part of the Islamic \r\n    economic system; there are texts which explain the kinds of wealth on which \r\n    zakaah is to be paid and the amounts due, and those to whom zakaah may be \r\n    given, and how it is to be paid. All that is well known.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also one of the means of achieving &ldquo;social security&rdquo;, \r\n    but in Islam social security is not limited solely to zakaah, rather it is \r\n    also achieved by other means, such as sadaqah (charity), waqfs, war booty \r\n    and stipends from the bayt al-maal (Muslim treasury).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslim society gives guidelines to both rich and poor; it \r\n    encourages the rich to give and enjoins upon them the zakaah of their \r\n    wealth. Thus it ensures that the poor and needy and those who are unable to \r\n    work, such as the elderly, widows and others, have enough to live on. Hence \r\n    Islam made zakaah an obligation, one of the five pillars of Islam, and \r\n    encourages Muslims to give charity, establish waqfs, and leave money to good \r\n    causes in their wills, and it lists the poor as one of the&nbsp; groups to whom \r\n    zakaah and money offered as expiation are to be given &ndash; such as expiations \r\n    offered for zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce in which the husband says to \r\n    his wife, &ldquo;You are to me as my mother&rsquo;s back&rdquo;), for broken oaths and broken \r\n    fasts, and the fidyah to be offered for certain transgressions during the \r\n    Hajj, so that the number of poor people in the Muslim society may be \r\n    reduced.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the Muslim state, if a person is unable to work and earn a \r\n    living and has no one such as a father, mother or other relative to spend on \r\n    him, and reason for his being unable to earn a living is that he is too \r\n    young or too sick or too old, he is entitled to assistance. Some Muslim \r\n    states have set up a system for providing assistance, according to various \r\n    criteria, such as pensions, spending on children whose parents have died \r\n    until they reach the age of discernment, and so on, even if they have money \r\n    of their own.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Other non-Muslim states, on the other hand, have set up \r\n    systems and special criteria that deal with the issue of assistance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim should be keen to earn a living from halaal \r\n    sources by working with his own hands.

The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) was the most generous person, even more generous than the strong \r\n    uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste to do charitable deeds).&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6; Muslim, 2308).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said: This hadeeth teaches us a number of things, \r\n    including the fact that it is mustahabb to be generous during Ramadaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if a person&rsquo;s zakaah is due in Ramadan, or it is due after \r\n    Ramadaan but he pays it in advance during Ramadaan in order to make the most \r\n    of the virtue of paying it in Ramadaan, there is nothing wrong with that. \r\n    But if his zakaah is due before Ramadaan (for example, in Rajab), and he \r\n    delays it so he can pay it in Ramadaan, this is not permissible, because it \r\n    is not permissible to delay zakaah unless one has a valid excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly: There may be some reasons why paying zakaah at a \r\n    time other than Ramadan is preferable to paying it during Ramadaan, such as \r\n    if there is a major disaster or famine in some Muslim country, then paying \r\n    zakaah at that time is preferable to paying it in Ramadaan. Another example \r\n    is if many people pay their zakaah during Ramadaan to meet the needs of the \r\n    poor, then the poor have no one to feed them at times other than Ramadaan; \r\n    in this case paying it at a time other than Ramadaan is preferable, even if \r\n    that leads to delaying zakaah, out of consideration for the needs of the \r\n    poor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthyameen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is permissible to delay zakaah if that is in the interests \r\n    of the poor and will not cause them harm.

[fatout]130487[\\fatout]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The way to work out the zakaah on trade goods is to work out \r\n    the value of the goods at the end of the zakaah year, then pay zakaah on \r\n    that at a rate of one quarter of ten per cent (2.5%).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/249:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever possesses trade goods and one year has passed since \r\n    he acquired (the money with which he brought them), and they reach the \r\n    nisaab (minimum threshold), should work out their value at the end of the \r\n    zakaah year, and whatever the value is, he should pay zakaah on it at a rate \r\n    of one quarter of ten per cent (2.5%).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The proper way is to work out the value of what he has of \r\n    trade goods upon the completion of the zakaah year, based on the value of \r\n    those goods at the time when zakaah became due, regardless of the price for \r\n    which the goods were bought.

For \r\n    example, if a person buys trade goods in the month of Muharram for two \r\n    hundred dirhams, then the value rises to three hundred dirhams before the \r\n    end of the zakaah year, even for a moment, he should pay zakaah on the total \r\n    value at the end of the zakaah year.

The view favoured by a number of our \r\n    contemporary scholars is that he does have to pay zakaah on his share of the \r\n    profits (even if they have not been divided).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is a difference of opinion as to whether zakaah must be \r\n    paid on the mudaarib&rsquo;s (partner&rsquo;s) share of the profits or not. The correct \r\n    view is that if one year has passed and the profits have not been divided, \r\n    he still has to pay zakaah, because it is profit on wealth that is subject \r\n    to zakaah, so he has to pay zakaah on it. And because this is what appears \r\n    to have been people&rsquo;s practice from the time of the Messenger (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) until the present day: when zakaah becomes due \r\n    on wealth (capital), it must be paid on both the capital and the profit.

If you give him twenty thousand, for example, \r\n    and he uses it to buy goods on the basis that he will have half of the \r\n    profits and will return your capital to you, then after one year the twenty \r\n    thousand has become thirty thousand with the profits, then the share of the \r\n    partner or worker is five thousand and the share of the owner of the money \r\n    is five thousand, and the capital is twenty thousand.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is subject to zakaah? The entire amount of thirty \r\n    thousand is subject to zakaah, and zakaah must be paid on all of it, on the \r\n    profit and on the capital.

No zakaah is due on houses, cars or buildings that a \r\n    person owns, unless one intends to trade in them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Factories usually contain products and goods that are for \r\n    trade, so these are subject to the zakaah on trade goods.

But \r\n    if he spends the money, and it is all gone or falls below the threshold, \r\n    then he does not have to pay zakaah. For example, a man has money that \r\n    reaches the minimum threshold in Ramadan, then he receives the money from \r\n    this group in Shawwaal.

A man may spend his whole life and not find \r\n    a single coin, and another man may work in farming and tilling his land, \r\n    then Allaah may bless him with finding something that will make him free of \r\n    want for the rest of his life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Many people \r\n    employ means that are not acceptable in sharee&rsquo;ah for extracting this \r\n    treasure. Some of them seek the help of magicians, soothsayers and other \r\n    charlatans, others rely on their contact with the jinn. All these methods \r\n    are unacceptable in Islam and constitute grave sins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There are \r\n    people who summon the jinn by means of incantations, and they make them \r\n    extract treasure that has been buried in the town&rsquo;s land since ancient \r\n    times. What is the ruling on this action?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This action \r\n    is not permissible. These incantations by means of which they summon the \r\n    jinn and employ them are &ndash; in most cases &ndash; not free of shirk, and shirk is a \r\n    serious matter. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, \r\n    whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allaah, then Allaah has \r\n    forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the \r\n    Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:72]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one who \r\n    goes to them tempts them and encourages them; he makes them think that what \r\n    they are doing is right and he tempts them by means of the money that he \r\n    gives to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We should \r\n    boycott these people and stop going to them, and warn our Muslim brothers \r\n    against going to them. In most cases these people trick the people and take \r\n    their wealth unlawfully, and tell lies. If (their predictions) happen to \r\n    coincide with the divine decree, they start to broadcast it among the \r\n    people, saying &ldquo;We said such and such and it happened,&rdquo; but if it does not \r\n    happen, they make false claims and say that this is what prevented it from \r\n    happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I offer the \r\n    following advice to those who are suffering with this matter: Beware of \r\n    telling lies to the people and associating others with Allaah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, and taking people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully, for the end of \r\n    the world is nigh and the reckoning of the Day of Resurrection is severe. \r\n    You have to repent to Allaah from this deed, and ensure that your deeds are \r\n    correct and your wealth is halaal. And Allaah is the Source of strength. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa \r\n    al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> (2\/question no. 116)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You should \r\n    understand that what makes many people pursue these illusions and seek them \r\n    from the magicians and charlatans etc is the love of luxury and their \r\n    longing for riches, without implementing the means of becoming rich, and \r\n    seeking wealth in inappropriate ways, as well as their laziness and \r\n    inclination towards idleness. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Khuldoon \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>What makes \r\n    people do that in most cases, in addition to their naivety, is an inability \r\n    to seek a living in the normal ways such as earning through trade, \r\n    agriculture and handicrafts, so they seek it in deviant ways and unnatural \r\n    ways, because they are not able to strive to earn a living and they do not \r\n    want to work hard for it. They do not realize that they are letting \r\n    themselves in for trouble by seeking wealth in inappropriate ways, and they \r\n    expose themselves to punishments, and their motive for that is their extreme \r\n    love for a life of luxury, which a regular way of earning would not be able \r\n    to support.<\/p>\r\n    <p>So when a \r\n    person fails to earn a living in the natural manner, his only answer is to \r\n    wish to have great wealth in one go, without making any effort, in order to \r\n    support the way of life to which he has become subservient. Hence you will \r\n    find him very keen and doing his utmost to earn money in that way.&nbsp; \r\n    Therefore you will see that most of those who strive for that are those who \r\n    are living a life of luxury of the ruling class and those who live a life of \r\n    ease in the cities such as Egypt etc. So you will find many of them very \r\n    keen to seek wealth in that manner, and they ask people coming from other \r\n    cities and countries about possible sites of treasure.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    Muqaddimat Ibn Khaldoon<\/i> (p. 385, 386)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Khaldoon \r\n    wrote a valuable chapter on this in his <i>Muqaddimah<\/i> (pp 384-389).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if the \r\n    Muslim avoids haraam ways such as incantations, seeking the help of the \r\n    jinn, magic and soothsaying, or transgression against the property of \r\n    others, such as land, houses and so on, then there is no sin on him if he \r\n    finds any of that buried treasure, and there is no sin on him if he seeks it \r\n    and looks for it, if he has knowledge of the ways of looking for it, and he \r\n    does not waste his life in running after mirages and dreams of treasure, \r\n    like those in the past who used to seek to turn metals into gold by means of \r\n    alchemy, and it was said of them: The one who seeks wealth by means of \r\n    alchemy will become penniless.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But to \r\n    suggest that there is a shar&rsquo;i way of looking for it, this is not correct \r\n    because Islam did not come to explain such matters, rather it came to \r\n    explain what is permitted and what is forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to tools and things that people have invented to find out about it by \r\n    physical means and indications, that is permissible for the one who learns \r\n    about it and uses it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows \r\n    best<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6133","question_id":"6133","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly: \r\n    Zakaah is not due on gold unless it reaches the nisaab (minimum threshold), \r\n    which is 85 grams.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If these \r\n    bracelets reach the nisaab, or your mother had other gold that when added to \r\n    the bracelets reached the nisaab, then zakaah is due on them.

If she did not believe that it was obligatory to \r\n    pay zakaah on it, either because she did not know that or because she was \r\n    uncertain because of the difference of opinion among the scholars concerning \r\n    that, then she found out that zakaah is obligatory, then she must pay zakaah \r\n    for the year in which she came to believe that zakaah is due on jewellery. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> (18\/146)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly: In \r\n    the event that you do not have to pay zakaah on these bracelets, then they \r\n    are your property and you may dispose of them however you wish.

In the \r\n    event that you do have to pay zakaah on them, then you must pay it \r\n    immediately and it is not permissible for you to delay it.

Its value should be calculated at the end of the \r\n    year, regardless of the price for which it was bought.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To that should be added the cash that is kept in the company \r\n    or in the bank.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To that should be added the debts that people owe you and \r\n    which you expect will be repaid. Then you should pay zakaah on the total at \r\n    a rate of 2.5%.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the company&rsquo;s profits throughout the year, \r\n    these profits may be divided into two types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Profits that result from the sale of glass to customers&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These profits are subject to zakaah, and a new year should \r\n    not be started for them, rather the year for them starts when the capital \r\n    with which they are bought was acquired, if it reaches the nisaab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/75&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Profits that result \r\n    from the assembly process itself (i.e., they may be regarded as payment for \r\n    assembly and manufacturing). Zakaah is due on these profits if they meet the \r\n    nisaab and one year has passed since they were acquired. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may be difficult in practical terms to differentiate \r\n    between these two types of profit, hence it is better to pay zakaah on the \r\n    entire profit at the end of the year as based on the capital. Whatever is \r\n    profit on trade goods, you will have paid its zakaah at the proper time \r\n    (i.e., after a year has passed) and whatever is payment for the work, you \r\n    will have paid its zakaah in advance, and paying zakaah ahead of time is \r\n    permissible.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no zakaah on profits that are spent during the year \r\n    and which do not remain at the end of the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The year of trade goods for a company does not start from the \r\n    date the company was first established or from when the raw materials were \r\n    purchased, rather it starts from when the money with which the raw materials \r\n    were purchased was acquired.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: if you first acquired the nisaab in Muharram, \r\n    and the company was founded in Rajab, and you bought the raw material and \r\n    started work in Ramadaan, the year for the trade goods starts in Muharram, \r\n    not in Ramadaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthyameen \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Note that the year for trade goods does \r\n    not end one year after they were bought, rather it is one year after the \r\n    original wealth was acquired. Because it is it is another form of money \r\n    which is part of your capital, where you have changed it into trade goods, \r\n    so the year starts with the acquisition of the original wealth.

It is not permissible to delay that, \r\n    except in the case of one who is unable to pay the zakaah because he does \r\n    not have any other wealth. In this case he may wait until he sells it and \r\n    then pay zakaah for all the years, paying for each year on the basis of its \r\n    value at the end of the year, whether it was worth more or less than the \r\n    price for which he bought the land, car or house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is the view of the \r\n    majority of scholars, because it was narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that zakaah be paid on things \r\n    that are prepared for sale, and because trade goods are kept for the purpose \r\n    of making money.

Among the evidence they quote for \r\n    that is the saheeh report from &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    concerning the debt that is not certain to be repaid. He said: &ldquo;If he is \r\n    sincere, let him pay zakaah on it when he receives it, for whatever years \r\n    have passed.&rdquo; Narrated by &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>, 7116.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And because it is \r\n    property that is under his control, so he must pay zakaah for the time that \r\n    has passed, like he pays zakaah for a debt that a rich man owes him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> by al-Nawawi, 6\/16; <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, \r\n    2\/345; <i>al-Insaaf<\/i> by al-Mardaawi, 3\/22&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; He should pay zakaah for one year when he gets it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is the view of &lsquo;Umar ibn &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez, al-Hasan, \r\n    al-Layth and al-Awzaa&rsquo;i, and is the view of Maalik as stated in <i>\r\n    al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i>, 1\/253, where he says: &ldquo;With regard to debt the indisputable \r\n    view among us is that a person should not pay zakaah on it until he receives \r\n    it, even if it stayed with the debtor for several years, then he receives it \r\n    after that, he only has to pay zakaah on it for one year.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See <i>al-Kaafi<\/i> by Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr, 1\/93&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This third view is the \r\n    one on which a fatwa from the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas (9\/190) \r\n    is based, in which it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the debt is owed by someone who is not well off, then he \r\n    should pay zakaah for one year when he takes possession of it, even if more \r\n    than one year has passed. This was narrated from Imam Ahmad, and is the view \r\n    of Maalik. Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan stated this in a fatwa and said: \r\n    This is the view favoured by Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was also regarded as more likely to be correct by Shaykh \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, who said that he should not pay zakaah on it until he takes \r\n    possession of it, and that when he does take possession of it, he should pay \r\n    zakaah for one year only. He said: If that debt is owed by one who is in \r\n    difficulty, then the correct view is that zakaah is not required, because \r\n    the owner has no right to demand his money according to sharee&rsquo;ah, because \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then \r\n    grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way \r\n    of charity, that is better for you if you did but know&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:280]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He is indeed not in \r\n    control of that money, so he does not have to pay zakaah on it. But if he \r\n    takes possession of it, then he must pay zakaah for one year only, even if \r\n    it remains in the possession of the debtor for ten years, because this is \r\n    like paying zakaah on things that come out of the earth when one acquires \r\n    them. Some of the scholars said that he should not pay zakaah for what is in \r\n    the past, rather he should start counting the year from scratch. But what we \r\n    have mentioned above is more on the safe side and is more likely to \r\n    discharge one's duty; he should pay zakaah for one year and then pay zakaah \r\n    after another year passes with it still in his possession. This is easy; it \r\n    is not difficult for a person to pay one quarter of one-tenth of a debt that \r\n    has been paid back to him after he had given up on it. This is a way of \r\n    showing gratitude to Allaah for having gotten it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Rasaa&rsquo;il Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    18\/28&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In conclusion: no zakaah is due on these properties that you \r\n    have, either those that you are renting out or those that are empty.

The phrase &ldquo;his slave and \r\n    his horse&rdquo; refer to his own possessions, i.e., things that are his own property and that he uses and benefits from, like his horse, or his slave, \r\n    or his clothes, or the house in which he lives, or the car that he uses even if it is for hire (i.e., a taxi). On all of these things there is no \r\n    zakaah, because a person acquires them for his own use, and he does not acquire them in order to trade them in the sense of buying them today and \r\n    selling them tomorrow.&nbsp; Based on this, whoever quotes this hadeeth to say that there is no zakaah on trade goods is making a far-fetched claim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \r\n    &ldquo;Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have what he intended.&rdquo; If we were to ask the trader or businessman what he wants from this \r\n    wealth, he would say &ldquo;I want gold and silver.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If I buy the goods today and sell it tomorrow and make money on it, \r\n    the objective is not to acquire the object itself at all. Based on this, we say that zakaah on trade goods is obligatory according to the texts \r\n    and according to analogy, even though the texts are not specific, rather they are general in meaning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    6\/141-142&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he said, giving an example \r\n    of that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A man bought a car in order to \r\n    make money from it (i.e., to sell it and make a profit from it). This is trade goods whose value reached the nisaab and he intended to sell it \r\n    when he bought it, so he has to pay zakaah on it. But if he bought the car in order to use it, then it occurred to him that he should sell it, \r\n    then there is no zakaah on it, because when he took possession of it, he had no intention of doing trade. So he has to have the intention of doing \r\n    trade at the moment when he acquires it. If he buys something for the purpose of trade but it does not reach the nisaab, and he does not have \r\n    anything else he can add to it, there is no zakaah on it, because one of the conditions of zakaah is that the wealth should reach the nisaab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    6\/142.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Land that is prepared for sale is \r\n    subject to zakaah.

There are differences among \r\n    them concerning the issues that we have mentioned. This is a brief look at \r\n    their opinions concerning that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (23\/238, 239):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The debt is the property of \r\n    the lender, but because it is not in its owner&rsquo;s possession, the fuqaha&rsquo; \r\n    differed concerning it. Ibn &lsquo;Umar, &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and &lsquo;Ikrimah the freed slave of \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them) were of the view that there is \r\n    no zakaah on a debt, and the reason for that is that it cannot grow (through \r\n    investment), so its zakaah is not due on it, like items that are kept for \r\n    personal use.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The majority of scholars \r\n    are of the view that debt which is due is of two types: that which it is \r\n    hoped will be paid off, and that concerning which there is no hope that it \r\n    will be paid off.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A debt which it is hoped \r\n    will be paid off is that which is owed by one who admits it and is willing \r\n    to repay it, and there are several views concerning this. The view of the \r\n    Hanafis and Hanbalis, which is also the view of al-Thawri, is that zakaah \r\n    must be paid on it by its owner every year, because it is wealth that \r\n    belongs to him; he does not have to pay zakaah on it whilst it is not in his \r\n    possession, but when he does take possession of it, he must pay zakaah on it \r\n    for all years past.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The basis for this opinion \r\n    is that it is a debt that is confirmed to be owed, so he does not have to \r\n    pay zakaah on it before he takes possession of it, and because he is not \r\n    making use of it at present, so he does not have to pay zakaah on wealth \r\n    that he is not making use of. But the entrusted item whose owner can take it \r\n    at any time does not come under this category, rather he must pay zakaah on \r\n    it when one year has passed. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The more correct view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, and of Hammaad ibn Abi Sulaymaan, Ishaaq and Abu &lsquo;Ubayd is that \r\n    he must pay zakaah at the end of every year on the debt that he hopes will \r\n    be repaid , as in the case of wealth that is in his possession, because he \r\n    is able to take it and dispose of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Malikis regarded debts \r\n    as being of different types: the zakaah of some debts is to be paid every \r\n    year, namely the debt of the merchant who buys and sells for trade; zakaah \r\n    is to be paid on the price that he is owed for the trade goods.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In other cases, zakaah is \r\n    to be paid when one year has passed since [the lender] first acquired it, \r\n    and it is to be paid for only one year, even if it stays with the borrower \r\n    for many years.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is no zakaah on some \r\n    kinds of debt, which is that which he did not take possession of, such as a \r\n    gift, mahr, or compensation for an injury and the like. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In the case of a debt for \r\n    which there is no hope of repayment, which is what is owed by one who is \r\n    hard up, or who denies it, or is delaying repayment, there are several \r\n    opinions. The opinion of the Hanafis in this case, which is the view of \r\n    Qataadah, Ishaaq and Abu Thawr, and is mentioned in one report from Ahmad, \r\n    and is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, is that there is no zakaah on it, because it \r\n    is not fully in his possession, because he is not able to make use of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second view, which is \r\n    the view of al-Thawri and Abu &lsquo;Ubayd, and is narrated in another report from \r\n    Ahmad, and is the more correct view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, is that he should pay \r\n    zakaah on it when he takes possession of it, for all years past, because of \r\n    the report narrated from &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) concerning \r\n    the uncertain debt: &ldquo;If he is sincere then let him pay zakaah when he takes \r\n    possession of it for what is past.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Maalik was of the view that \r\n    he should pay zakaah when he takes possession of it for one year, even if it \r\n    stayed with the debtor for several years. This is the view of &lsquo;Umar ibn &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-&lsquo;Azeez, al-Hasan, al-Layth and al-Awzaa&rsquo;i. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What we think is most \r\n    correct in this case is that which was mentioned in a fatwa issued by the \r\n    scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas and by Shaykh Muhammad \r\n    ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen.

The former is a concession (rukhsah) and the latter is a virtue, and \r\n    is more expedient in discharging one&rsquo;s duty.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if it is owed by one \r\n    who is delaying payment or one who is hard up, then no zakaah is due on it, \r\n    even if it remains for ten years, because he is unable to dispose of it, but \r\n    if he takes possession of it, he should pay zakaah once, for the year in \r\n    which he took possession of it, and he does not have to pay zakaah for the \r\n    time that has passed.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This opinion was mentioned \r\n    by Shaykh al-&lsquo;Anqari in his commentary on Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-Wahhaab, and his grandsons (may Allaah have mercy on them). It is also \r\n    the view of Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) and this is the \r\n    correct view, for the following reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is akin to crops on which \r\n    zakaah must be paid when they are acquired, and rent, concerning which \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam favoured the view that zakaah must be paid on them when \r\n    taking possession of them, even if a full year has not yet passed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>One of the conditions of zakaah \r\n    being obligatory is that one must be able to pay it; when one is able to pay \r\n    it, then zakaah must be paid.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>A few months of the year may \r\n    have passed before he gave it as a loan. <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Waiving zakaah for what has \r\n    passed and making it obligatory to pay zakaah for the year in which one \r\n    takes possession of it only makes things easier for the owner, because how \r\n    can we oblige him to pay zakaah when he is obliged to give the one who is \r\n    hard up more time? It is also making things easier for the one who is hard \r\n    up, by giving him more time.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>An example of that is \r\n    wealth that is buried and forgotten. If a person buried his wealth for fear \r\n    that it might be stolen, then he forgets its whereabouts, he should pay \r\n    zakaah only for the year in which he found it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Another example is stolen \r\n    wealth, if it remains with the thief for several years, then its owner \r\n    manages to find it; he should pay zakaah for one year only, like the debt \r\n    that is owed by one who is hard up.

The majority of them are of the view that it may given to \r\n    any of the eight categories to whom the zakaah of wealth should be given. \r\n    Some of them were of the view that it should be given to all of these eight \r\n    categories, and others were of the view that it should b egiven only to the \r\n    poor and needy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (23\/344):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo; differed concerning who should be given zakaat \r\n    al-fitr and there are three views: the majority are of the view that it is \r\n    permissible to divide it among the eight categories to whom the zakaah of \r\n    wealth may be given; the Maalikis &ndash; and it was also narrated from Ahmad and \r\n    was the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah &ndash; are of the view that it should be \r\n    given only to the poor and needy; and the Shaafa&rsquo;is are of the view that it \r\n    should be divided among the eight categories or whoever of them are \r\n    available. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah refuted the first and third \r\n    views in <i>Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> <i>al-Fataawa<\/i> (25\/73-78). He explained that \r\n    zakaat al-fitr has to do with the number of people, not wealth. Among the \r\n    things he said there was the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence Allaah has enjoined that it be in the form of food, \r\n    just as He has enjoined that expiation be in the form of food. Based on this \r\n    view, it is not permissible to give zakaat al-fitr except to those who are \r\n    entitled to receive food given as expiation, and they are those who take it \r\n    because they are in need of it, so it should not be given to those whose \r\n    hearts are to be reconciled or to slaves etc. This is the strongest view, \r\n    based on the evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The weakest opinion is that of those who say that it is \r\n    obligatory for every Muslim to give his sadaqat al-fitr to twelve or \r\n    eighteen or twenty-four or thirty-two or twenty-eight and so on, because \r\n    this is contrary to the practice of the Muslims at the time of the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the \r\n    Rightly-Guided Caliphs and all the Sahaabah. No Muslim did this at that \r\n    time, rather the Muslim would give his own sadaqat al-fitr and the sadaqat \r\n    al-fitr of his family to one Muslim. If they had seen someone sharing the \r\n    saa&rsquo; between umpteen people, giving each one a handful they would have \r\n    denounced that in the strongest terms and regarded it as a reprehensible \r\n    innovation and objectionable deed. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) stated that the enjoined amount is a saa&rsquo; of dates, or a \r\n    saa&rsquo; of barley, or half a saa&rsquo; or a saa&rsquo; of wheat, based on the amount that \r\n    is sufficient for one poor person, and he stipulated that it should be food \r\n    for them on the day of Eid to make them independent of means. If the poor \r\n    person takes a handful of food he will not benefit from it and it will not \r\n    go very far. The same applies to the debtor and wayfarer &ndash; if they take a \r\n    handful of wheat it will not benefit them. &hellip; Islam is above such a \r\n    reprehensible action which no wise person would approve of and which none of \r\n    the salaf or imams of this ummah did.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;as food for the poor&rdquo;, show that this is the right \r\n    of the poor person, as Allaah says in the verse of zihaar (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;should feed sixty Masaakeen (poor)&rdquo; [al-Mujaadilah 58:4]<\/i>. \r\n    So if it is not permissible to give it to these eight categories, then the \r\n    same applies here. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, the most correct of these three opinions is \r\n    the second one, which is that sadaqat al-fitr should be given to the poor \r\n    and needy, and no one else. This is what was regarded as most correct by \r\n    Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), as it says in <i>\r\n    al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (6\/117).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If zakaat of one&rsquo;s wealth and zakaat al-fitr are given to \r\n    relatives who are entitled to it, that is better than giving it to others \r\n    who are entitled to it, because in this case it is both zakaah and upholding \r\n    ties of kinship. But that is subject to the condition that this relative is \r\n    not one of those on whom the one who is giving the zakaah is obliged to \r\n    spend. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on giving zakaat al-fitr to poor \r\n    relatives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is permissible to give zakaat al-fitr and the zakaah of \r\n    one's wealth to poor relatives, and indeed giving it to relatives is better \r\n    than giving it to strangers, because giving it to relatives is both charity \r\n    and upholding the ties of kinship. But that is subject to the condition that \r\n    by giving it he is not protecting his wealth, which would be the case if the \r\n    poor person is one on whom he is obliged to spend. In that case it is not \r\n    permissible for him to meet the other person&rsquo;s needs with any of his zakaah, \r\n    because if he does that then he is saving his wealth with what he gives of \r\n    zakaah, and that is not permissible or allowed. But if he is not obliged to \r\n    spend on him, then he may give his zakaah to him, and in fact giving his \r\n    zakaah to him is better than giving it to a stranger, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Your charity given \r\n    to a relative is both charity and upholding the ties of kinship.&rdquo; End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> \r\n    (18\/question no. 301).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Conclusion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your aunt is poor then she is entitled to zakaah, even if \r\n    she owns half a dunam, but it is better for her to sell it and thus make \r\n    herself independent of means so that she will not be dependent on people&rsquo;s \r\n    gifts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslims should not leave their relatives until the month \r\n    of Ramadaan is nearly over and then check on them and give them a saa&rsquo; of \r\n    food, rather the Muslims should always check on the poor and needy and \r\n    hasten to give them what they need of food, money and clothing, and this is \r\n    required more so of the rich who should check on their poor relatives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6202","question_id":"6202","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has stated the eight categories to whom zakaah may be \r\n    given, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the \r\n    Fuqaraa&rsquo; (poor), and Al&#8209;Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect \r\n    (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined \r\n    (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon &mdash; those fighting in a holy battle), and \r\n    for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty \r\n    imposed by Allaah.

If he is in need, then \r\n    zakaah is permissible for him, even if he owns the minimum threshold of \r\n    wealth. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.

They should be given zakaah to \r\n    meet their needs. The difference between the fuqara&rsquo; and masaakeen is that \r\n    the fuqara&rsquo; are in greater need; one of them cannot find enough to suffice \r\n    himself and his dependents for half a year. The masaakeen are better off \r\n    than the fuqara&rsquo;, because they can find half of what will suffice them or \r\n    more. These people should be given zakaah because of their need.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;But how can we evaluate need?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars said: They should be given what they need to \r\n    suffice them and their families for one year, because when the year has \r\n    passed, zakaah will become due again. Just as the year is the unit of time \r\n    by which zakaah becomes due, so too the year should be the unit of time by \r\n    which the poor and needy, who are entitled to zakaah, should be given \r\n    zakaah. This is a good view, i.e., we should give the poor and needy person \r\n    what will suffice him and his family for a full year, whether we give it in \r\n    the form of food and clothing, or we give him money with which to buy what \r\n    suits him, or we give him tools with which he can make things, if he is good \r\n    at that, such as a tailor, carpenter or blacksmith and so on. What matters \r\n    is that we give him what will suffice him and his family for one year.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The third is<\/u>:&nbsp; those employed to \r\n    collect or administer (the funds), i.e., those who are appointed by the \r\n    authorities. This refers to those who are involved in the collection and \r\n    distribution of zakaah. They are the collectors who collect it from those \r\n    who have to pay it, and the ones who divide it among those who are entitled \r\n    to it, and those who record it, and so on. All of these are those employed \r\n    to collect [or administer] (the funds) who may be given some of the zakaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But how much of it should they be given?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who are employed to administer the zakaah deserve to be \r\n    paid from it in return for their work, and they should be given according to \r\n    their efforts. Based on this, they should be given zakaah commensurate with \r\n    their work, whether they are rich or poor, because they are receiving zakaah \r\n    for their work, not because of their need. Based on this, they should be \r\n    given of the zakaah what they deserve for their work.&nbsp; If it so happens that \r\n    those who are employed to administer the zakaah are poor, they may be given \r\n    zakaah for their work, and be given whatever will suffice them for one year \r\n    because of their being poor. They are entitled to zakaah on two counts &ndash; \r\n    because of their work in administering it and because of their poverty, so \r\n    they should be given zakaah for both reasons. But if we give them zakaah for \r\n    their work and that will not meet their needs for one year, then we should \r\n    give them more so that they have enough for one year. An example of that is \r\n    if we assume that ten thousand riyals will suffice them for one year and \r\n    ifwe give them zakaah because of their being poor they will receive ten \r\n    thousand riyals. If their share because of their work is two thousand \r\n    riyals, then we should give them two thousand riyals for their work, and \r\n    give them eight thousand riyals because of their being poor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The fourth is<\/u>:&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>to attract \r\n    the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam)<\/i>&rdquo;. These are \r\n    people who may be given zakaah in order to open their hearts towards Islam, \r\n    either a kaafir who we hope will become Muslim, or a Muslim to whom we give \r\n    in order to strengthen his faith, or an evil man to whom we give zakaah so \r\n    as to ward off his evil from the Muslims, and other cases in which it is in \r\n    the Muslims&rsquo; interests to attract their hearts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But is it necessary that he should be a leader who is obeyed \r\n    among his people, so that attracting his heart will serve a greater \r\n    interest, or is it permissible to give to attract individual&rsquo;s hearts, such \r\n    as a man who has recently entered Islam and needs something to attract his \r\n    heart and strengthen his faith?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is an issue concerning which the scholars differed. The \r\n    most correct view in my opinion is that there is nothing wrong with giving \r\n    zakaah to attract a person to Islam and strengthen his faith, even if that \r\n    is on an individual level and he is not a leader among his people, because \r\n    of the general meaning of the words &ldquo;<i>to attract the hearts of those who \r\n    have been inclined (towards Islam)<\/i>&rdquo;, and because if it is permissible to \r\n    give to the poor because of his physical needs, then it is more appropriate \r\n    that we should give to this one who is weak in faith in order to strengthen \r\n    his faith, because strengthening a person&rsquo;s faith is more important than \r\n    nourishing his body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These four may be given zakaah on the basis of ownership; \r\n    they may be given full ownership that is not altered if they cease to fall \r\n    into these categories during the year. They will not be required to return \r\n    the zakaah and it will remain permissible for them, because Allaah described \r\n    them as being entitled to it and says &ldquo;<i>As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) \r\n    are only for the Fuqaraa&rsquo; (poor), and Al&#8209;Masaakeen (the poor) and those \r\n    employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have \r\n    been inclined (towards Islam)<\/i>&rdquo;. He used the word <i>li<\/i> (<i>innama \r\n    al-sadaqaat li&rsquo;l-fuqara&rsquo;<\/i> [<i>As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only \r\n    for the Fuqaraa&rsquo; (poor)<\/i>]&hellip;). What this means is that even if the poor \r\n    person becomes independent of means during the year, he is not obliged to \r\n    return the zakaah, such as if we were to give him ten thousand because he is \r\n    poor and that will suffice him for one year, then Allaah made him \r\n    independent of means during that year by causing him to earn money, or by \r\n    causing him to inherit from a relative who dies, and so on, he does not have \r\n    to return whatever is left of the zakaah money that he took, because it now \r\n    belongs to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The fifth category<\/u> of those who \r\n    are entitled to zakaah is: slaves. The scholars explained this in three \r\n    ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>A mukaatib or slave who has \r\n    entered into a contract of manumission to buy himself from his master for a \r\n    sum to be paid later. He may be given enough money to fulfil this contract \r\n    with his master.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>A slave who may be bought with \r\n    zakaah funds and set free<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>A Muslim prisoner who has been \r\n    captured by the kuffaar; the kuffaar may be given zakaah funds to ransom \r\n    this prisoner. This also applies to kidnapping: if a kaafir or Muslim has \r\n    kidnapped a Muslim, there is nothing wrong with ransoming this person with \r\n    zakaah funds, because the purpose is the same, namely releasing a Muslim \r\n    from captivity. This applies if we are not able to force the kidnapper to \r\n    release him without using this money, if the victim is a Muslim. \r\n    <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The sixth is<\/u>: those who are in \r\n    debt. The scholars divided debt into two categories: debts incurred to bring \r\n    about reconciliation, and debts incurred because of need. With regard to \r\n    debts incurred to bring about reconciliation, they gave the example of a \r\n    case where there is a dispute, conflict or war between two tribes, and a man \r\n    of good will, standing and honour comes and reconciles between these two \r\n    tribes, incurring expenses for which he takes responsibility. So we should \r\n    give this man money from zakaah, in appreciation of his great effort which \r\n    has put an end to enmity and hostility and bloodshed among believers. He \r\n    should be given zakaah regardless of whether he is rich or poor, because we \r\n    are not giving it because he is in need, rather we are giving it because he \r\n    has brought about reconciliation, which serves the common interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second category of debtors is the one who is in debt on \r\n    his own account, who took a loan either to meet his own needs, and he did \r\n    not have money. His debt may be paid off from zakaah funds so long as he \r\n    does not have any wealth that could be used to pay off the debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The question here is: is it better for us to give the zakaah \r\n    wealth to the debtor to pay off his debt, or to go to his lender and pay it \r\n    off on his behalf?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It depends. If the debtor is keen to pay off his debt, and he \r\n    can be trusted to use what he is given to pay off the debt, then we give it \r\n    to him so that he may pay off his debt himself, because this is more \r\n    concealing and is less likely to embarrass him in front of the people who \r\n    are asking him to pay off the debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he is a careless man who wastes money, and if we give \r\n    him money to pay off his debt he will go and buy things that he does not \r\n    need, then we should not give it to him, rather we should go to the lender \r\n    and say to him: How much does So and so owe you?&rdquo; then we should give him \r\n    the money or some of it, depending on what we can afford.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The seventh is<\/u>: &ldquo;for Allaah&rsquo;s \r\n    Cause&rdquo;. What is meant here is jihad for the sake of Allaah and nothing else. \r\n    It is not correct to say that it means all kinds of goodness or charity, \r\n    because if what is meant was all kinds of goodness or charity, there would \r\n    be no point in Allaah limiting it and saying (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the \r\n    Fuqaraa&rsquo; (poor), and Al&#8209;Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect \r\n    (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined \r\n    (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon &mdash; those fighting in a holy battle), and \r\n    for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty \r\n    imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Tawbah 9:60]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    in that case this limitation (<i>innama<\/i>, translated here \r\n    as &ldquo;only&rdquo;) would have no meaning. What is meant by &ldquo;for Allaah&rsquo;s Cause&rdquo; is \r\n    jihad for the sake of Allaah. Zakaah should be given to those who are \r\n    fighting for the sake of Allaah, who are evidently fighting so that the word \r\n    of Allaah will be supreme. They should given whatever they need of zakaah in \r\n    the form of money, weapons and so on. It is permissible to buy weapons for \r\n    them from the zakaah funds so that they may use them for fighting, but it is \r\n    essential that the fighting be for the sake of Allaah. Fighting for the sake \r\n    of Allaah was explained by the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) when he was asked about a man who fought for his tribe, or \r\n    because he is brave, or to show off: which of them was fighting for the sake \r\n    of Allaah? He said: &ldquo;The one who fights so that the word of Allaah may be \r\n    supreme is the one who is fighting for the sake of Allaah.&rdquo; The man who \r\n    fights for tribal or nationalistic reasons is not fighting for the sake of \r\n    Allaah and does not deserve what the one who fights for the sake of Allaah \r\n    deserves, whether that is material things in this world or reward in the \r\n    Hereafter. The man who fights for the sake of courage, because he loves to \r\n    fight because is brave &ndash; and the one who has a characteristic usually loves \r\n    to do that no matter what the situation &ndash; is not fighting for the sake of \r\n    Allaah either. The one who fights to show off is fighting to earn a \r\n    reputation, and he is not fighting for the sake of Allaah. None of them are \r\n    fighting for the sake of Allaah, so they are not entitled to zakaah, because \r\n    Allaah says &ldquo;<i>and for Allaah&rsquo;s Cause<\/i>&rdquo;. The one who is fighting for \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s Cause is the one who is fighting so that word of Allaah will be \r\n    supreme.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars said: &ldquo;for Allaah's cause&rdquo; includes a man who \r\n    devotes his time to seeking Islamic knowledge. He may be given zakaah for \r\n    whatever he needs of maintenance, clothing, food, drink, accommodation and \r\n    books of knowledge that he needs, because Islamic knowledge is a kind of \r\n    jihad for the sake of Allaah. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;There is nothing equivalent to knowledge for one who has the right \r\n    intention.&rdquo; Knowledge is the basis of all sharee&rsquo;ah, and there is no \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah except with knowledge. Allaah revealed the Book so that people \r\n    would establish justice and learn the rulings of their religion and what \r\n    they are required to believe, say and do. With regard to jihad for the sake \r\n    of Allaah, it is one of the noblest of deeds, and it is the pinnacle of \r\n    Islam, and there is no doubt concerning its virtue, but knowledge is \r\n    extremely important in Islam, and there is no doubt that it may be included \r\n    under the heading of jihad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The eighth is<\/u>: wayfarers, i.e., \r\n    travellers who are cut off from everything and have no money. Such a \r\n    traveller may be given enough zakaah to enable him to reach his homeland, \r\n    even if he is rich in his own country, because he is in need. In this case, \r\n    we do not say that the traveller has to borrow money and pay it back, \r\n    because in this case we would be imposing a debt on him. But if he chooses \r\n    to borrow and pay it back, and not take the zakaah, then it is up to him. If \r\n    we find a person who is travelling from Makkah to Madeenah, and he loses his \r\n    money (and supplies) and does not have anything, but he is rich in Madeenah, \r\n    then we should give him just enough to help him reach Madeenah, because this \r\n    is what he needs, and we should not give him any more than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now that we know the eight categories to whom zakaah may be \r\n    given, zakaah should not be spent on other interests, whether public or \r\n    private. Based on this, we should not use zakaah to build mosques, repair \r\n    roads, build libraries and so on, because when Allaah mentioned the \r\n    categories of those to whom zakaah may be given, He said (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, \r\n    All-Wise&rdquo;<\/i> i.e., these categories have come as an obligation from Allaah. \r\n    &ldquo;<i>And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise<\/i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then we say: must zakaah be given to each of these \r\n    categories, because the word <i>wa<\/i> (and) implies all?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that this is not obligatory, because the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Mu&rsquo;aadh ibn \r\n    Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him), when he sent him to Yemen: &ldquo;Teach \r\n    them that Allaah has enjoined on them charity (zakaah) from their wealth, to \r\n    be taken from their rich and given to their poor.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned only one category, which \r\n    indicates that in this verse Allaah explained those on whom zakaah may be \r\n    spent, but it does not mean that zakaah must be given to all of them at the \r\n    same time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said: which of these categories should be given \r\n    priority with regard to zakaah? We say: Priority should be given where the \r\n    need is greatest, because all of them are entitled, so whoever is in greater \r\n    need should be given priority. Usually the ones who are in greatest need are \r\n    the poor and needy, hence Allaah started with them and said (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the \r\n    Fuqaraa&rsquo; (poor), and Al&#8209;Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect \r\n    (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined \r\n    (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon &mdash; those fighting in a holy battle), and \r\n    for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty \r\n    imposed by Allaah.

But knowledge has a high status in \r\n    Islam, and the fact that it is included in jihad is obvious and there is no \r\n    doubt concerning that. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, 337-338.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>The Standing Committee was asked: <\/p>\r\n    <p>Is it permissible to give zakaah funds to \r\n    seekers of knowledge who are in desperate need? <\/p>\r\n    <p>They replied: <\/p>\r\n    <p>Yes, it is permissible to give them zakaah to \r\n    meet their needs. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah, 10\/17. \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah: \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>The fuqaha&rsquo; are agreed that it is permissible \r\n    to give zakaah to seekers of knowledge. This was clearly stated by the \r\n    Hanafis and Shaafa&rsquo;is and Hanbalis, and this is what is understood from the \r\n    Maaliki madhhab. Some of the Hanafis were of the view that it is permissible \r\n    for a seeker of knowledge to accept zakaah even if he is rich, if he is \r\n    devoting all his time to seeking knowledge and teach others, because he is \r\n    unable to earn a living otherwise. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said: If he is able to earn a \r\n    living that suits his situation, but he is too busy acquiring Islamic \r\n    knowledge to such an extent that if he were to start earning a living he \r\n    would have to stop seeking knowledge, then it is permissible for him to \r\n    receive zakaah, because seeking knowledge is a communal obligation (fard \r\n    kafaayah). <\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Taymiyah was asked about someone who did \r\n    not have enough money to buy books to study. He said: It is permissible for \r\n    him to take zakaah for what he needs to buy books of knowledge that he needs \r\n    for his religious and worldly interests. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Buhooti said: Perhaps that is included in \r\n    the areas where zakaah may be given, because that comes under the heading of \r\n    what the seeker of knowledge needs, so it is like his other expenses. The \r\n    fuqaha&rsquo; said that it is permissible to give zakaah to seekers of Islamic \r\n    knowledge only. <\/p>\r\n    <p>The Hanafis clearly stated that it is \r\n    permissible to transfer zakaah from one land to another to give it to a \r\n    seeker of knowledge. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 28\/337. \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6243","question_id":"6243","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>It is permissible to give zakaah to the debtors themselves, and it is also \r\n    permissible to give it directly to the people to whom the debts are owed.

He may collect it, even without the permission (of the \r\n    debtor), unless the debt is of the type where the intention of the debtor is \r\n    stipulated, in which case he can only do that with permission, as in the \r\n    case of zakaah and expiation, because the one who has to pay the zakaah did \r\n    not intend that and did not ask anyone to do it on his behalf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>An example of that is where \r\n    a man comes and says: I am going to join the mujaahideen, give me some \r\n    zakaah money, and I know that my friend has a lot of zakaah to be paid. So I \r\n    gave this man 30,000 on the basis that it is my friend&rsquo;s zakaah -- can I get \r\n    it back? The answer is no, because the intention is essential in the case of \r\n    zakaah, and in this case the one who owes zakaah did not have that \r\n    intention. But the 30,000 is not wasted; rather there is great reward with \r\n    Allaah for it and it will be charity on the part of the one who gave it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If I tell him about that \r\n    and say: I gave zakaah on your behalf, and he says: May Allaah reward you \r\n    with good, I give my consent for that, then according to the madhhab this \r\n    does not count as zakaah, because the intention was not there at the time \r\n    when it was paid. But the correct view is that this is permissible, and the \r\n    evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) and the story about his guarding the dates, when the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) appointed him to guard the \r\n    sadaqat al-fitr, and the Shaytaan came to him one night and took some of the \r\n    dates. Abu Hurayrah grabbed him and the Shaytaan said that he was poor and \r\n    had a family, so Abu Hurayrah felt sorry for him and let him go. This \r\n    happened again on the second night, and on the third night he said: &ldquo;You \r\n    have to go to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him.&rdquo; He \r\n    was afraid of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) and \r\n    said: &ldquo;I will tell you of a verse, that if you recite it at night you will \r\n    have a guardian with you from Allaah and no devil will come near you until \r\n    morning.&rdquo; And he taught him Aayat al-Kurisy. The following morning, the \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said to him: &ldquo;What \r\n    happened to your prisoner last night?&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;He told you the truth \r\n    even though he is a liar.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Do you know who you have been \r\n    talking to for the last three nights?&rdquo; He said No.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;That was a \r\n    devil.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him), when he gave some of that zakaah, did not give it with \r\n    the permission of the Messenger, but the Messenger (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) allowed it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So the correct view is that \r\n    if a person gives zakaah on behalf of another person, and that person allows \r\n    it, then the correct view is that it is valid and permissible.

If the state collects taxes instead \r\n    of the obligatory zakaah that merchants and the like should pay, then it \r\n    must be paid. If it collects taxes in addition to zakaah, but the bayt \r\n    al-maal needs to finance essential interests such as schools, bridges and \r\n    mosques, and to pay civil servants, it is permissible to pay it and it is \r\n    not permissible to withhold it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the state takes taxes from its citizens other than \r\n    zakaah, and wastes it on extravagance, corruption, idle leisure and other \r\n    haraam things, and it does not spend it on legitimate interests, such as \r\n    those who are entitled to zakaah, then it is permissible to conceal wealth \r\n    and profits so as not to give them haraam wealth and help them in doing \r\n    haraam things. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;but do not help one another in sin and transgression&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:3]<\/i>. End quote.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    discussing the difference between the public interest and innovated \r\n    interests:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The public interest (<i>al-maslahah al-mursalah<\/i>) is \r\n    completely different from so-called &ldquo;good innovation&rdquo; (<i>bid&lsquo;ah hasanah<\/i>). \r\n    The public interest is for the purpose of achieving some interest dictated \r\n    by place and time, that is approved of by Islam. In this regard, Imam \r\n    ash-Shaatibi confirmed that it is Islamically permissible to impose taxes \r\n    that are different from the taxes that are imposed nowadays in many, if not \r\n    all, Muslim countries on the basis of unclear, ambiguous laws, in imitation \r\n    of the kuffaar who were deprived of the blessing of following the path of \r\n    Allah that is based on the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). For those who were deprived of \r\n    the guidance of the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah, it became a necessity to draw up for \r\n    themselves a specific system and to promulgate laws to deal with their \r\n    problems. But for the Muslims, Allah caused them to have no need of such \r\n    things, by virtue of the Book which He sent down to them and by virtue of \r\n    what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    explained to them. Hence it is not permissible for the Muslims to replace \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah with man-made laws, lest the words of Allah, <i>&ldquo;Would you \r\n    exchange that which is better for that which is lower?&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:61]<\/i> \r\n    become applicable to them. So it is not permissible under any circumstances \r\n    to impose taxes as a fixed, immutable law, as if it is a law divinely \r\n    revealed from heaven for all time. Rather the kind of taxes that it is \r\n    permissible for the Muslim state to impose is in specific circumstances that \r\n    the state is going through. I think that this example is the one that was \r\n    given by Imam ash-Shaatibi: If a Muslim country is attacked, and there are \r\n    no funds in the state treasury to prepare and equip armies to ward off that \r\n    attack by the enemies of Islam, then in such circumstances the state may \r\n    impose a specific tax on particular people who can afford to pay what is \r\n    imposed on them. But that should not become a binding tax and established \r\n    law -- as we stated above. Once the passing reason, which is the kaafir \r\n    attack and the need to defend the Muslim land, is no longer applicable, then \r\n    the taxes are waived from the Muslims, because the reason for which the \r\n    taxes were imposed is no longer present. The ruling -- as the fuqaha&rsquo; stated \r\n    -- is connected to the reason for it: if the reason exists then the ruling \r\n    applies, but when it is no longer present, the ruling no longer applies. The \r\n    reason or cause that makes this obligatory duty essential is no longer \r\n    present, and when it has disappeared the taxes should also disappear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: there are no taxes that should become part of \r\n    Islamic law and regulations; rather the Muslim state may impose specific \r\n    taxes in specific circumstances, and when circumstances change, the taxes \r\n    should be abolished.

It is not permissible for anyone to take his brother&rsquo;s wealth \r\n    unlawfully, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;If you sell fruit to your brother then the crop (on the tree) fails, it is \r\n    not permissible for you to take anything of it (his brother&rsquo;s money). On \r\n    what basis would you consume your brother&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully?&rdquo; But the \r\n    Muslim is required to hear and obey; he should listen to those in authority \r\n    and obey those in authority. If they ask him for money for such matters, he \r\n    should give it to them. Then if he has a right to it, he will find it \r\n    restored (i.e., on the Day of Resurrection), and if it he does not have any \r\n    right to it, in that it was taken from him in a justifiable manner, then \r\n    there will be nothing to be settled. What matters is that what we are \r\n    obliged to do is to hear and obey with regard to those in authority. The \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Hear and obey, \r\n    even if your back is beaten and your wealth is taken.&rdquo; It is not permissible \r\n    to take these matters as an excuse to criticize those in authority and to \r\n    slander them in gatherings and the like. We should be patient and whatever \r\n    we do not get in this world we will get in the Hereafter.

There are two well-known views, one of \r\n    which is that it does not mean that one does not have to pay zakaah, so if a \r\n    person possesses the nisaab (minimum amount of wealth at which zakaah \r\n    becomes due) and one full<b> <\/b>year has passed, then he must pay zakaah, \r\n    no matter what his debt is. This is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him), and it is what is regarded as most correct by many of the \r\n    scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That is because of the general meaning of the evidence which \r\n    indicates that zakaah is obligatory for everyone who owns the nisaab, and \r\n    because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) used to send \r\n    his workers to collect zakaah, and he did not tell them to enquire as to \r\n    whether the owners of the wealth had debts or not. And because zakaah has to \r\n    do with what one actually possesses, and debt is a commitment, so the one \r\n    does not rule out the other.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Does debt \r\n    cancel out the obligation of zakaah? There are three opinions concerning \r\n    that, the most sound of which according to our companions, which is also the \r\n    view stated by al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah be pleased with him) in most of his \r\n    new books, is that it is obligatory... To sum up, our view is that zakaah is \r\n    obligatory, whether the wealth is hidden or apparent, and whether the wealth \r\n    is of the same type as the debt or not. Our companions said: whether it is a \r\n    debt owed to a human being or a debt owed to Allaah, such as previous \r\n    zakaah, expiation, vows and so on.

If there are more than three hundred, then for every hundred, one \r\n    sheep is due. And if the flock of a man is less than forty sheep, then no \r\n    zakaah is due unless their owner wants to give.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The majority of fuqaha&rsquo; stipulated that in order for zakaah \r\n    on an&rsquo;aam animals to be obligatory, they must be in the pasture, i.e., they \r\n    graze in the pasture for most of the year. As for those which are given \r\n    feed, no zakaah is due on them unless they are for trade. The evidence that \r\n    their being pastured is a condition of zakaah is to be found in the words of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The zakaah on \r\n    sheep in the pasture&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/230-243<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>Fataawa \r\n    al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (9\/202): The scholars are unanimously agreed that \r\n    zakaah is obligatory in the case of grazing camels, cattle and sheep, if \r\n    their number reaches the nisaab. The minimum number in the case of camels is \r\n    five, in the case of cattle is thirty and in the case of sheep is forty. \r\n    Grazing animals are those that eat grass etc in the pasture, unlike those \r\n    that are given feed and working animals that are used for carrying loads.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars differed as to whether zakaah is due on animals \r\n    that are given feed and working animals. The majority of scholars are of the \r\n    view that no zakaah is due on them because of the report narrated by Ahmad, \r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i and Abu Dawood from Bahz ibn Hakeem, from his father, from his \r\n    grandfather, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;For grazing camels, for every forty a\r\n    <i>bint laboon<\/i>&hellip;&rdquo; So the obligation to pay zakaah is limited to camels \r\n    that are grazing, and it is not required in the case of those that are given \r\n    feed. As for working camels, there is the hadeeth of &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him): &ldquo;There is no zakaah on working animals.&rdquo; Maalik and a \r\n    number of other scholars were of the view that zakaah is obligatory on \r\n    animals that are given feed and working animals too.

As for zakaah, it is \r\n    a financial duty, and financial duties are required of minors; if a minor \r\n    were to destroy a person&rsquo;s property then he is required to pay compensation \r\n    from his own wealth, and he is obliged to spend on his relatives if the \r\n    conditions of that being obligatory are met.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They also said that there is no difference between regarding \r\n    zakaah on crops and zakaat al-fitr as being obligatory for a child, and the \r\n    zakaah of other things such as gold, silver and cash.

The guardian acts in his \r\n    stead when paying what he is obliged to pay. This is a duty that is required \r\n    of the minor or insane person, so the guardian must perform it on their \r\n    behalf, like spending on relatives.

If the guardian does not pay the zakaah, then \r\n    the child or insane person must pay zakaah for past years after attaining \r\n    puberty or after recovering, because this is an obligation upon their \r\n    wealth.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas that zakaah \r\n    is obligatory upon a minor but he does not have to pay it until he reaches \r\n    puberty. But this view is da&rsquo;eef (weak) and is not valid. It was classed as \r\n    da&rsquo;eef by al-Nawawi in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 5\/301.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A man died and left behind wealth and orphans.

If that is the case, who should pay it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Zakaah must be paid on \r\n    the wealth of orphans, whether it is money, trade goods, livestock of an&rsquo;aam \r\n    animals (camels, cattle, sheep and goats) or grains and produce on which \r\n    zakaah is due. The guardian of the orphans must pay it on time&hellip; the year is \r\n    to be calculated from the death of their father, because when he died, the \r\n    wealth came into their possession. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

This \r\n    is the view of &lsquo;Ali, Ibn &lsquo;Umar, Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah, &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, and \r\n    al-Hasan ibn &lsquo;Ali, as narrated from them by Ibn al-Mundhir. The guardian \r\n    should pay it on their behalf. The fact that it is obligatory is indicated \r\n    by the general meaning of the evidence that zakaah is obligatory, as \r\n    mentioned in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Mu&rsquo;aadh to Yemen and told him what to \r\n    say to them, one of the things he said was: &ldquo;Tell them that they must give \r\n    zakaah, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    the group. The word &ldquo;rich&rdquo; includes minors and the insane, as does the word \r\n    &ldquo;poor&rdquo;. Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i narrated in his <i>Musnad<\/i> from Yoosuf ibn Maahik \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Trade with the wealth of orphans and do not let it be lost or consumed by \r\n    zakaah.&rdquo; This is mursal. Maalik narrated in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> that he heard \r\n    that &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) say: Do trade \r\n    with the wealth of orphans and do not let it be consumed by zakaah. &lsquo;Umar \r\n    said that to the people and enjoined it upon them, which implies that it was \r\n    a rule that was followed and accepted as the correct ruling. Maalik also \r\n    narrated in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> from &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim that his \r\n    father said: &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah used to take care of me and a brother of mine, who \r\n    were orphans under her care, and she used to pay zakaah from our wealth.

This takes into account the \r\n    quantity of the gold, the carat and whether it is used gold.

This is the view of most of the scholars, such as al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and \r\n    others. The basic principle behind giving charity is to help the poor, as \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;on a scale of the average \r\n    of that with which you feed your own families&rdquo; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:89]<\/i>.

This is the view of some of the Hanafis and some of the Shaafa&rsquo;is. \r\n    They said: because it is zakaah and they likened it to the zakaah of one&rsquo;s \r\n    wealth with regard to paying it in advance in all cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most correct view is the first one.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (2\/676):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason why it is obligatory is the breaking of the fast, \r\n    which is indicated by the fact that it is mentioned in conjunction with it. \r\n    The purpose behind it is to make the poor independent of means at a specific \r\n    time, and it is not permissible to pay it in advance of that time. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked, as it says in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (18\/zakaat \r\n    al-fitr\/question no. 180):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I paid zakaat al-fitr at the beginning of Ramadaan in Egypt \r\n    before I came to Makkah, and now I am staying in Makkah al-Mukarramah.

The phrase &ldquo;zakaat al-fitr&rdquo; is composed of two words, \r\n    which explains the reason for the zakaah, which is breaking the fast (fitr). \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So zakaat al-fitr is mentioned in conjunction with the fitr \r\n    (breaking of the fast) because that is the reason for it, and it is known \r\n    that breaking the fast of Ramadaan occurs only on the last day of Ramadaan, \r\n    so it is not permissible to pay zakaat al-fitr except when the sun has set \r\n    on the last day of Ramadaan, except that there is a concession allowing it \r\n    to be paid one or two days before. Otherwise the proper time for it is after \r\n    sunset on the last day of Ramadaan, because that is the time when the \r\n    Ramadaan fast is to be broken.

No one else differed from that except Sa&rsquo;eed ibn \r\n    al-Musayyab and al-Hasan al-Basri, who said that zakaat al-fitr is due only \r\n    from those who fasted. But the correct view is that of the majority, because \r\n    of the following evidence:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash;The general meaning of the hadeeth which is the basis for \r\n    zakaat al-fitr being obligatory: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) enjoined zakaat al-fitr, a saa&rsquo; of dates or a saa&rsquo; of barley, upon \r\n    everyone, slave or free, male or female, young or old, and he enjoined that \r\n    it be paid before the people went out to pray. Narrated by al-Bukhaari \r\n    (1503) and Muslim (984).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The word &ldquo;young&rdquo; includes small children who cannot fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; When charity and zakaah are enjoined, it is usually to \r\n    help the poor and needy, and is aimed at achieving some degree of social \r\n    security, and the most obvious case is zakaat al-fitr, which is enjoined \r\n    upon young and old, free and slave, male and female, and the Lawgiver did \r\n    not stipulate any minimum threshold (nisaab) or the passage of one year for \r\n    it to be obligatory. Hence the fact that it is obligatory for those who did \r\n    not fast in Ramadaan, with or without an excuse, is implied in the purpose \r\n    for which this zakaah is prescribed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; With regard to the argument of those who quoted as \r\n    evidence the words of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him): The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    enjoined zakaat al-fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle \r\n    talk and obscene speech, and to feed the poor. Narrated by Abu Dawood (1609) \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: The words &ldquo;as a purification for the fasting \r\n    person&rdquo; means that zakaat al-fitr is obligatory only for those who fasted. \r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar responded to that in <i>al-Fath<\/i> (3\/369) where he \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My response is that mentioning purification refers to the \r\n    usual case (as most people fast), just as it is also required of those who \r\n    did not commit sin, such as one who is very righteous or one who became \r\n    Muslim a moment before the sun set. End quote.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What this means is that in most cases zakaat al-fitr is \r\n    prescribed because it is a purification for the one who fasted, but \r\n    attaining this purification is not a condition of it being obligatory. A \r\n    similar case is the zakaah of one&rsquo;s wealth, which has also been prescribed \r\n    in order to purify the soul: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify \r\n    them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allaah for them. Verily, your \r\n    invocations are a source of security for them; and Allaah is All-Hearer, \r\n    All-Knower&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Tawbah 9:103]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Despite that zakaah is obligatory in the case of wealth \r\n    belonging to a small child who does not need to be purified, because no bad \r\n    deeds are recorded for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen gave another response, and said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is paid on behalf of children and those who are not \r\n    accountable, and those who did not fast because of an excuse such as \r\n    sickness or travel. So the purification is for the guardians of those who \r\n    are not accountable, and it is a purification for the one who did not fast \r\n    because of an excuse, on the assumption that he will fast once the excuse is \r\n    no longer in effect, so it is purification in advance, before he fasts or \r\n    completes his fast.

This is the correct \r\n    view, because zakaah is a help from the rich to the poor, and the Muslim \r\n    does not have to help with anything other than the staple food of his \r\n    country. Undoubtedly rice is the staple food in the land of the Two Holy \r\n    Sanctuaries (Saudi Arabia) and it is a good and valuable food; it is better \r\n    than the barley that is mentioned in the text. Hence it is known that there \r\n    is nothing wrong with giving rice as zakaat al-fitr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What must be given is a saa&rsquo; of any kind of staple food, \r\n    i.e., a saa&rsquo; of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him), which is four complete scoops as scooped up with two hands, according \r\n    to <i>al-Qaamoos<\/i> etc. In modern weights this is equivalent to \r\n    approximately three kilograms.

With regard to a foetus, it is not \r\n    obligatory to give it on his behalf according to scholarly consensus, but it \r\n    is mustahabb, because &lsquo;Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) did that.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also obligatory to give it before the Eid prayer, and \r\n    it is not permissible to delay it until after the Eid prayer.

The \r\n    companions of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) used to give it one or two days before Eid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those to whom it must be given are the poor and needy.

These \r\n    deeds will reach him after his death.&rdquo; This hadeeth hwas classed as hasan by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Ibn Maajah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ongoing charity may mean \r\n    building a mosque, buying Mushafs (copies of the Qur&rsquo;aan) to be placed in \r\n    the mosque, or designating a house or a place as a waqf so that its income \r\n    is spent on the poor, orphans, relatives, seekers of knowledge or others as \r\n    stipulated by the one who establishes the waqf, or donating money to build a \r\n    charitable hospital, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to \r\n    charity that is not ongoing, this is charity in which the thing given is not \r\n    &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;, rather it is given to the poor to become his property and be made \r\n    use of however he wishes, such as giving him money, food, clothing, medicine \r\n    or furniture.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person establishes a \r\n    mosque as a waqf, then it is destroyed or falls down, it is permissible to \r\n    sell part of it in order to renovate the rest. If it is not possible to make \r\n    use of any part of it, then the whole thing may be sold and the money \r\n    donated to another waqf. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;If a waqf is destroyed and nothing is left of it, it may be sold and the \r\n    money used to buy something to be given back to the people in charge of the \r\n    waqf, and it should be made a waqf like the first one was. The same applies \r\n    to a horse kept for jihad, if it is no longer fit for fighting, it should be \r\n    sold and the money used to buy another one that is fit for jihad. What we \r\n    conclude from this is that if a waqf is destroyed and is no longer of any \r\n    use, such as a house that collapses or land that is ruined and becomes dead \r\n    and no longer fit for cultivation, or a mosque from which the people move \r\n    away, and is now in a place where people do not pray, or it becomes too \r\n    small for the people and cannot accommodate them all, or it falls into \r\n    disrepair, and it cannot be maintained except by selling part of it, then it \r\n    is permissible to sell part of it in order to take care of the maintenance \r\n    of the rest of it. If it is not possible to use any part of it, then the \r\n    whole thing may be sold. Ahmad said, according to a report narrated by Abu \r\n    Dawood: if there are two pieces of wood in the mosque which are of some \r\n    value, it is permissible to sell them and spend the money raised on the \r\n    mosque. According to a report narrated by Saalih: the mosque may be removed \r\n    to another location if there is the fear of it being robbed or if the \r\n    location is in a filthy area. Al-Qaadi said: i.e., if that prevents people \r\n    from praying there. And he stated that it is permissible to sell its \r\n    courtyard, according to a report narrated by &lsquo;Abd-Allaah. The imam should \r\n    give testimony to that effect (i.e., that these changes are necessary)\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>From <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, \r\n    5\/368.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;So long as the waqf is \r\n    still in existence, the reward for its founder will be ongoing; the same is \r\n    also true if the original waqf is sold and the money put into a new waqf. \r\n    Whoever builds a mosque will have the reward promised for that. This is what \r\n    is narrated in the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him): &ldquo;Whoever builds a mosque for the sake of Allaah, even if it is \r\n    like the nest of a sand grouse, Allaah will build for him a house in \r\n    Paradise.&rdquo; The hadeeth gives an example of building the smallest thing \r\n    possible.

If a person gives in \r\n    charity that which affects his needs or the needs of those for whom he is \r\n    responsible, that is a sin, because his spending on them is obligatory and \r\n    it is not permissible to give precedence to a naafil (supererogatory) action \r\n    over an obligatory one. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But with regard to whatever is surplus to the needs of those \r\n    on whom a person is obliged to spend, the majority of scholars say that \r\n    holding on to whatever wealth he needs is preferable to giving it all away \r\n    in charity, unless he has an income or is sure that he will be able to put \r\n    his trust in Allaah and be patient and steadfast in bearing poverty and will \r\n    be able to refrain from begging.

But some Maalikis add to that a \r\n    comment which may be understood as meaning that they regard it as mustahabb, \r\n    as they say, &#8220;The way of encouraging giving all one's wealth in charity is \r\n    that the donor should feel good about it after giving all his wealth and \r\n    should not feel regret about being without wealth or hope to gain a similar \r\n    amount of wealth in the future. He should not have any need of it in the \r\n    future for himself or for those on whom he is obliged or encouraged to \r\n    spend. Otherwise it is not recommended for him (to give all his wealth in \r\n    charity), rather it is haraam for him to do so if those on whom he is \r\n    obliged to spend are in certain need, or it is makrooh for him to do so if \r\n    he is certain that those on whom it is recommended for him to spend are in \r\n    need, because it is better to give in charity that which is surplus to his \r\n    needs and the needs of those on whom he is obliged to spend.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (<i>al-Mawsoo&#8217;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, 26\/339)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>From these comments it is \r\n    clear that the scholars did not limit charity to one third (of one's \r\n    wealth).

But if a person is not like that, \r\n    then he should not do that. This is how the words &#8220;There is no charity \r\n    except when one has the means&#8221; should be interpreted.

They think that it is the moment when they buy the trade \r\n    goods, but that is not correct. Rather the year for trade goods is when the \r\n    year from when one acquired the money with which one buys them has passed, \r\n    if that money reaches the nisaab (threshold).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What this \r\n    means is that if a person buys trade goods &ndash; such as goats that are fed etc \r\n    &ndash; with gold or silver or cash that reaches the nisaab, then the year starts \r\n    from the time when he took possession of that gold or silver or cash. \r\n    Similarly, if he buys goats in return for a car that he trades, the year for \r\n    the goats is the year from when he acquired the car.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason \r\n    for that is that in trade you buy and sell, and exchange money or goods, and \r\n    if the year is not based on the wealth which came before, there would be no \r\n    zakaah on trade goods.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, explaining this issue: If a \r\n    person buys trade goods with money that reaches the nisaab, such as a man \r\n    who has two hundred dirhams, and during the year he buys trade goods with \r\n    it, the year does not start when he buys the good, rather it is based on the \r\n    first, because the year for trade goods is to be based on the first.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Another \r\n    example is if a man has one thousand riyals of which he takes possession in \r\n    Ramadaan, then in Sha&rsquo;baan of the following year he buys some trade goods. \r\n    When Ramadaan comes, he must pay zakaah on those trade goods, because the \r\n    year for trade goods is based on the year for the money with which they are \r\n    bought.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The same \r\n    applies if he trades goods that reach the nisaab for other goods. For \r\n    example, a man has a car, and during the year he trades it for another car \r\n    for the purpose of trade. The year should be based on the first car, because \r\n    what is sought is its value, not the difference in the two products, and he \r\n    did not buy the second car to use it, rather he wanted it so that he could \r\n    trade it. End quote from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on \r\n    this, if you took possession of ten thousand, for example, in Ramadaan, then \r\n    you bought goats with it in Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, and you started to sell them or \r\n    their offspring, and buy others, the year for zakaah is in Ramadaan. You \r\n    have to work out the value of the goats that you have each year, then add to \r\n    that the cash that you have, and pay zakaah on the total at a rate of \r\n    one-quarter of one-tenth.&nbsp; The year for zakaah will continue to be in \r\n    Ramadaan unless the amount falls below the nisaab during the year, such as \r\n    if a person sells what he has in Safar, for example, and he puts the money \r\n    into buying land or a house to live in, then Allaah blesses him with wealth \r\n    during Rajab, so he buys more goats to trade.

If a person has shares worth thirty thousand and at the \r\n    end of the year these shares are worth sixty thousand, then he must pay \r\n    zakaah on sixty thousand, and if at the end of the year the thirty thousand \r\n    is worth only ten thousand, then he only has to pay zakaah on ten thousand. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> \r\n    (18\/226).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the money that you have invested in the stock \r\n    market, if your intention when buying the shares was to deal in them &ndash; as \r\n    seems to be the case &ndash; then these shares are regarded as trade goods, so \r\n    when the year ends you must work out the value of the shares based on the \r\n    market value and pay zakaah on them.

These shares are regarded as trade goods, \r\n    so zakaah is due on them and on their profits. So zakaah must be paid \r\n    according to their value each year, plus their profits.

So if a person has thirty thousand shares and at the end of \r\n    the year they are worth sixthy thousand, he has to pay zakaah on sixty \r\n    thousand. If at the end of the year the thirty thousand is worth only ten \r\n    thousand, then he only has to pay zakaah on ten thousand. Based on this, the \r\n    questioner has to work out the zakaah for every year, and he should pay \r\n    zakaah for each year. But if these shares have not yet been sold, he should \r\n    pay zakaah on them when they are sold.

He quoted as evidence for \r\n    that the fact that in some ahaadeeth the word <i>ibl<\/i> (camels) in used in \r\n    a general sense and is not defined as those that are grazing, as in the \r\n    letter of Abu Bakr to Anas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) in which \r\n    it says: &ldquo;With regard to twenty-four camels or less, for every five one \r\n    sheep (is to be given as zakaah).&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The majority of scholars \r\n    responded to this deduction by stating that this hadeeth is general in \r\n    meaning, and that the other ahaadeeth define (the animals) as those that \r\n    graze. The basic principle here is that the general should be interpreted in \r\n    light of the specific.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They supported this by saying:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the zakaah on an&rsquo;aam animals, it is connected \r\n    to the idea of growth and multiplication. This is obvious with regard to \r\n    grazing animals, because there is no cost involved in looking after them. \r\n    With regard to animals that are fed, there is a cost involved in looking \r\n    after them, and that cost may be equal to any growth (in their numbers or \r\n    weight). Thus the wisdom and mercy of Allaah dictated that zakaah should be \r\n    waived unless the (grazing) animals are prepared for the purpose of trade, \r\n    such as when one buys animals then looks after them and feeds them in order \r\n    to fatten them for sale. In that case they come under the heading of trade \r\n    goods and thus are subject to zakaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/12; <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, 23\/250.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information on how to calculate the zakaah on trade \r\n    goods, see question no. <a>\r\n    10823<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> \r\n    (32\/32):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words in this hadeeth, &ldquo;for grazing sheep&rdquo; represent an \r\n    area concerning which there is some scholarly difference of opinion. The \r\n    view of Maalik is that working camels and oxen, and rams that are fed, are \r\n    subject to zakaah. Abu &lsquo;Umar said: This is also the view of al-Layth, but I \r\n    do not know of anyone who said it apart from them. With regard to \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ahmad and Abu Haneefah, and also al-Thawri, al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and \r\n    others, in their view no zakaah is due on these animals. This was narrated \r\n    from a number of the Sahaabah: &lsquo;Ali, Jabir, and Mu&rsquo;aadh ibn Jabal. &lsquo;Umar ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez also wrote a letter to this effect, and it was narrated in \r\n    the hadeeth of Bahz ibn Hakeem from his father, from his grandfather, from \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that he said: \r\n    &ldquo;For all grazing livestock, for every forty a two-year-old she camel (bint \r\n    laboon).&rdquo; So it was limited to grazing livestock, and other general reports \r\n    should be interpreted in the light of specific reports, when both are \r\n    speaking of the same type of animals, and there is no dispute among the \r\n    scholars concerning this matter.

This is similar to the situation if \r\n    he traveled whilst fasting from a place where the sun sets at 6 p.m. to a \r\n    land where the sun does not set until 7 p.m. &ndash; he should not break his fast \r\n    until the sun sets at 7 p.m., because Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.

This is the most correct 9?) view, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Your fast is the day when you \r\n    fast, and your breaking the fast is the day when you break the fast, and \r\n    your sacrifice is the day when you offer the sacrifice.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan ghareeb.

End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, \r\n    25\/114.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He also \r\n    quoted as evidence the fact that even if he sighted the new moon of \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah on his own, none of the scholars suggested that he should \r\n    observe the standing at &lsquo;Arafah on his own.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He said that \r\n    the basic principle concerning this matter is that the ruling is connected \r\n    to the new moon of the month.

But that is not the case, rather it has \r\n    to appear to the people and they have to announce the beginning of the month \r\n    when they see it. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Your fast is the day when you fast, and your breaking the \r\n    fast is the day when you break the fast, and your sacrifice is the day when \r\n    you offer the sacrifice&rdquo; i.e., this day on which you announce the beginning \r\n    or end of the fast or the sacrifice.

It is prescribed for the Muslims to \r\n    strive in seeking it and it is more important on the night before the \r\n    thirtieth of Sha&rsquo;baan, in order to find out whether Ramadaan has begun, and \r\n    on the night before the thirtieth of Ramadaan in order to find out whether \r\n    the month has ended and Shawwaal has begun, and on the night before the \r\n    thirtieth of Dhu&rsquo;l-Qa&rsquo;dah to find out if Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah has begun. These three \r\n    months have to do with two of the pillars of Islam, namely fasting and Hajj, \r\n    and the setting of the dates for &lsquo;Eid al-Fitr and &lsquo;Eid al-Adha.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    encouraged seeking the sighting of the moon.

The second hadeeth forbids fasting Ramadaan \r\n    before the new moon is sighted or before Sha&rsquo;baan has been completed if it \r\n    is cloudy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And there is a hadeeth narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in which he enjoined paying attention \r\n    to the new moon of Sha&rsquo;baan because of Ramadaan. He said: &ldquo;Count the days of \r\n    Sha&rsquo;baan carefully for the sake of Ramadaan.&rdquo; This hadeeth shows the \r\n    importance of paying attention to the month of Sha&rsquo;baan in order to work out \r\n    when Ramadaan starts. It was narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with her) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    used to count the days in Sha&rsquo;baan more carefully than at any other time, \r\n    then he would fast when he sighted (the new moon) of Ramadaan, and if it was \r\n    cloudy he would count thirty days and then fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The commentators said: i.e., he would make sure to count the \r\n    days of Sha&rsquo;baan carefully in order to begin the fast of Ramadaan at the \r\n    right time. During the lifetime of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) and after he died, the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them) were concerned with sighting the new moon of Ramadaan and they \r\n    used to look for it. It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) said: The people sighted the new moon and I told the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about \r\n    that, and he fasted and told the people to fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) said: We were with &lsquo;Umar between Makkah and Madeenah and we looked \r\n    for the new moon. I was a man who had keen eyesight and I sighted it, but no \r\n    one else claimed that he had seen it except me. I started saying to &lsquo;Umar: \r\n    Do you not see it? And he could not see it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Hanafis regard sighting the new moon of Ramadaan on the \r\n    night before the thirtieth of Sha&rsquo;baan as a communal obligation, and if they \r\n    sight it they should fast, otherwise they should complete the month (as \r\n    thirty days) and then fast, because that which is essential to performance \r\n    of an obligatory duty is also obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Hanbalis say that it is mustahabb to sight the new moons \r\n    so as to be on the safe side with regard to fasting and so as to avoid \r\n    disputes.

Islam came to encourage agreement, harmony and cooperation in \r\n    righteousness and piety, and to encourage people to avoid fighting and \r\n    arguing, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And hold \r\n    fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur&rsquo;aan), and be \r\n    not divided among yourselves&rdquo; [Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:103]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said, when he sent Mu&rsquo;aadh and Abu Moosa to Yemen: &ldquo;Give glad tidings and do \r\n    not put people off, be in harmony and do not differ.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&rsquo;ah<\/i> \r\n    (15\/103, 104).<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6504","question_id":"6504","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a Muslim is living in a country which relies on proper \r\n    shar&rsquo;i sighting of the moon to establish the beginning and end of the month, \r\n    then he is enjoined to follow them with regard to starting and ending the \r\n    fast.

Al-Haafiz narrated \r\n    in <i>al-Fath<\/i> (4\/127) that al-Baaji said: The consensus of the salaf is \r\n    that calculations should not be relied on, and their consensus is proof for \r\n    those who come after them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; They should commit to following the sighting of the moon \r\n    in any Muslim state that follows the sharee&rsquo;ah of Allaah and adheres to its \r\n    rulings. When it is proven in that country that the new moon has been \r\n    sighted with shar&rsquo;i proof, with regard to the beginning or end of the fast, \r\n    then they should follow that, in accordance with the words of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Fast when you see it, and \r\n    stop fasting when you see it, and if it is too cloudy then complete the \r\n    number (of days)&rdquo; and &ldquo;We are an unlettered nation, we do not write or \r\n    calculate.

For example: \r\n    a man slept early on the night before the thirtieth of Sha&rsquo;baan, and it is \r\n    possible that this night may be the first of Ramadaan, so he said: &lsquo;If \r\n    tomorrow is Ramadaan then it will be my obligatory fast,&rsquo; or he said, &lsquo;If \r\n    tomorrow is Ramadaan then I am fasting,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;If tomorrow is Ramadaan then \r\n    it is my obligatory fast, and if it is not then it is an obligatory \r\n    expiation&rsquo; and the like. Our view is that this is not valid, because his \r\n    words, &lsquo;If it is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast&rsquo; show a kind of \r\n    uncertainty, but intentions must be based on certainty. So if he does not \r\n    wake up until after dawn and he finds out that it is Ramadaan, then he has \r\n    to make up this day, according to the author.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second view narrated from Imam Ahmad is that his fast is \r\n    valid if he finds out that it is Ramadaan. This view was favoured by Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). Perhaps this is \r\n    included in the general meaning of the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Dubaa&rsquo;ah bint al-Zubayr: &ldquo;Go for Hajj, \r\n    and stipulate that if you are prevented from continuing, you will exit \r\n    ihraam at that point and Allaah will accept whatever you stipulate.&rdquo; This \r\n    man made his intention conditional because he did not know whether the next \r\n    day would be Ramadaan, so his hesitation was based on uncertainty about the \r\n    month, but there was no uncertainty about whether he would fast or not. \r\n    Hence if he said on the night before the first of Ramadaan: &lsquo;I may fast \r\n    tomorrow or I may not,&rsquo; we say that this is not valid because it is \r\n    uncertainty. &hellip; Based on this, if we go to sleep on the night before the \r\n    thirtieth of Sha&rsquo;baan , we may intend that if the next day is Ramadaan, we \r\n    will fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 6\/375.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6515","question_id":"6515","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most likely reason for the differences in the start of \r\n    the fast from one country to another is the difference in sighting the new \r\n    moon.

Rather the difference of scholarly opinion has to do with whether the \r\n    difference in moon sighting matters or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: The issue of whether the difference in moon \r\n    sighting matters or not is a theoretical matter in which there is room for \r\n    ijtihaad. Even people of great knowledge and piety differed concerning this \r\n    matter. This is a type of difference which is acceptable, where the one who \r\n    makes ijtihaad and gets it right will have two rewards, one for his ijtihaad \r\n    and the other for getting it right, and the one who gets it wrong will be \r\n    rewarded for his ijtihaad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars differed concerning this matter and there are \r\n    two points of view. One is that the difference in moon sighting matters and \r\n    the other is that it does not matter. Each group quotes evidence from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and sometimes they quote the same text, such as when \r\n    they both quote the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;They ask you (O \r\n    Muhammad) about the new moons.

Each Islamic state \r\n    should have the right to choose whichever opinion it wishes, based on the \r\n    suggestions of its own scholars, because each view has its evidence and \r\n    proofs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: The Council has studied the issue of proving the new \r\n    moon by means of calculation, and what has been narrated in the Qur&rsquo;aan and \r\n    Sunnah, and they have studied the comments of the scholars on this matter. \r\n    They have decided unanimously that astronomical calculations carry no weight \r\n    in determining the new moon with regard to Islamic matters, because the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Fast when \r\n    you see it and stop fasting when you see it.&rdquo; And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not fast until you see it, and do \r\n    not stop fasting until you see it.&rdquo; And because of other evidence to that \r\n    effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote, from <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, 10\/102.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6516","question_id":"6516","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    What matters when a person started fasting in one country and \r\n    finished fasting in a country to which he travelled, is that if the total \r\n    number of days that he fasted was twenty-eight, then he must make up one \r\n    day, because the lunar month cannot be less than 29 days.

Then when the moon appeared, it rose \r\n    from the place he mentioned and not they place they mentioned. But he \r\n    excused them because their conclusion was not based on direct moon sighting; \r\n    rather it was based on calculations with the computers they had.

There is evidence in the saheeh Sunnah which indicates that \r\n    this is obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Abu \r\n    Sa&rsquo;eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We traveled with the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to \r\n    Makkah when we were fasting. We made a stop, and the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;You have drawn near \r\n    to your enemy, and breaking the fast will make you stronger.&rdquo; This was a \r\n    concession, so some of us fasted and some did not. Then we made another stop \r\n    and he said: &ldquo;In the morning, you are going to meet your enemy.

But if what you did was training that could \r\n    have been delayed, or was a parade after which you would not meet the enemy, \r\n    then it seems that it was not permissible for you to break the fast. A \r\n    distinction should be made between the two matters and it is not permissible \r\n    to confuse them. The first case in which is it permissible or obligatory to \r\n    break the fast is when it is certain or most likely that you will meet the \r\n    enemy, and the second case in which it is not permissible to break the fast \r\n    is when it is a military parade and training in which you are not preparing \r\n    to meet the enemy soon, or it could be delayed until after sunset, so that \r\n    the troops will be able to do the training and fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>An example of that is one \r\n    who needs to break the fast in order to gain strength for jihad for the sake \r\n    of Allaah in fighting the enemy. He may break the fast and should make up \r\n    the fasts that he misses, whether that is when he is travelling or he is in \r\n    his homeland, if the enemy comes there, because that is defending the \r\n    Muslims and making the word of Allaah supreme. In <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> it is \r\n    narrated that Abu Sa&rsquo;eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We \r\n    traveled with the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) to Makkah when we were fasting &hellip; and he quoted the hadeeth. This \r\n    hadeeth suggests that gaining strength for fighting is a reason separate \r\n    from travelling, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) gave the reason for breaking the fast as gaining strength for \r\n    fighting the enemy, not travelling. Hence he did not tell them to break the \r\n    fast at the first halting-place.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan<\/i> \r\n    (eighth session).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (28\/57) it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They (the scholars) added \r\n    to the exhaustion of hunger and thirst the fear of physical weakness when \r\n    meeting the enemy that one is likely or certain to meet, such as if one is \r\n    surrounded.

If the \r\n    woman says, I want to wean him before two years, but the father says no, \r\n    then she does not have the right to wean him unless the father approves and \r\n    they reach an agreement. If they reach an agreement before two years, they \r\n    may wean him, but if they disagree then they should not wean him before two \r\n    years, as Allaah says: &ldquo;<i>If they both decide on weaning, by mutual \r\n    consent, and after due consultation<\/i>&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if what is meant is switching the child from breast milk \r\n    to formula, this affects the interests of the child by denying him natural \r\n    breast milk, and the importance of natural breastfeeding to the child has \r\n    been proven beyond any shadow of a doubt.

Some of the scholars said that all they have to do is make up the \r\n    missed fasts, no matter what the situation, because there is no evidence in \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah for giving food in this case, and the basic principle \r\n    is that there is no obligation unless proof of that is established.

If she does not fast, then like others who do not fast for \r\n    a valid reason, she has to make up the days when that excuse no longer \r\n    applies. When she gives birth, she has to make up those fasts after she \r\n    becomes pure from nifaas. But sometimes the excuse of pregnancy may be \r\n    lifted but then immediately followed by another excuse, namely \r\n    breastfeeding. The breastfeeding mother may need food and drink, especially \r\n    during the long summer days when it is very hot. So she may need not to fast \r\n    so that she can nourish her child with her milk.

On this basis, she should pray and fast \r\n    even if she sees some blood, but she should do wudoo&rsquo; for each prayer, and \r\n    she has to make up the days when she did not fast and the prayers that she \r\n    missed.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (See <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, 10.218)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the fasts that she has missed: &ldquo;Everyone who \r\n    owes fasts from Ramadaan has to make them up before the next Ramadaan.

I.e., if he fasted then during the day he broke his fast with no \r\n    excuse, he has committed a sin, and he has to make up that day because when \r\n    he started that fast, it became binding on him to complete it, so he has to \r\n    make it up, like a vow. But if he did not fast at all, deliberately and with \r\n    no excuse, then the correct view is that he does not have to make it up, \r\n    because that will not benefit him at all, as it will never be accepted from \r\n    him. The basic principle with regard to acts of worship that are connected \r\n    to specific times is that if a person delays them beyond that specific time \r\n    with no excuse, they will not be accepted from him, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    said: &quot;Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with this matter of \r\n    ours, will have it rejected.&quot; And because it is a transgression of the \r\n    sacred limits of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and transgressing \r\n    the sacred limits of Allaah is zulm (wrongdoing), and no deeds are accepted \r\n    from the zaalim (wrongdoer).

He led \r\n    the people of Makkah in praying two rak&rsquo;ahs, then he said to them: &ldquo;O people \r\n    of Makkah, offer the prayer in full, for we are people who are travelling.&rdquo; \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on them) \r\n    stated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \r\n    not fasting that year, i.e., he broke the fast for ten days in Makkah during \r\n    the conquest. In <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> it is narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: He remained not fasting until the \r\n    month ended. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (144). Undoubtedly he prayed two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs during this period because he was travelling, and the fact that a \r\n    pilgrim doing &lsquo;umrah is a traveller does not cease when he reaches Makkah, \r\n    so he does not have to refrain from eating and drinking if he arrives not \r\n    fasting. Rather we say to him: If that will give you more strength to \r\n    perform &lsquo;umrah then it is better for you not to fast, so long as doing \r\n    &lsquo;umrah will exhaust you. Some people may be able to carry on fasting even \r\n    when travelling, because fasting whilst travelling nowadays does not cause a \r\n    great deal of hardship. So a person carries on fasting whilst travelling, \r\n    then when he reaches Makkah feeling tired he says to himself: Shall I carry \r\n    on fasting or shall I delay doing &lsquo;umrah until after I break my fast? i.e., \r\n    until night time, or is it better for me to break my fast so that I can \r\n    perform &lsquo;umrah as soon as I arrive in Makkah? We say to him in this case: It \r\n    is better for you to break your fast; even if you are fasting, break your \r\n    fast so that you can perform &lsquo;umrah as soon as you arrive, because when the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah in \r\n    ihraam, he hastened to the mosque. He made his mount kneel beside the mosque \r\n    and entered it so as to perform the rituals for which he was in a state of \r\n    ihraam. Breaking your fast so that you can have the energy to perform the \r\n    rituals during the day is better than continuing to fast and then making up \r\n    your &lsquo;umrah at night when you have broken your fast. It is proven that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was fasting during \r\n    his journey to conquer Makkah, but some people came to him and said: O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, fasting is too hard for the people and they are looking \r\n    to see what you will do. That was after &lsquo;Asr, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called for water and drank it whilst \r\n    the people were looking on. He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) broke the fast during the journey, and he even broke the fast at the \r\n    end of the day, all so that people would not cause hardship for themselves \r\n    by fasting. Some people burden themselves with fasting whilst travelling \r\n    despite the hardship, which is undoubtedly contrary to the Sunnah. The words \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) apply to \r\n    them: &ldquo;It is not righteousness to fast when travelling.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, Fataawa al-Siyaam (138, 139)."},{"id":"6553","question_id":"6553","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and scholarly \r\n    consensus indicates that the traveller is allowed not to fast during \r\n    Ramadaan, then he should make up the number of days that he missed.

Some of them \r\n    quoted as evidence the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;But if one is forced by necessity without willful \r\n    disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:173]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point here is that Allaah has not permitted the eating of \r\n    dead meat to those who are willfully disobedient or who transgress the \r\n    limits, because they are sinners.

They said: The one who is willfully disobedient is the one who \r\n    seeks haraam food despite the fact that he is able to obtain halaal food, \r\n    and the one who transgresses the limits is the one who takes more than he \r\n    needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the one who travels in order to break the \r\n    fast, he is trying to find ways around the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah, so he \r\n    should be punished by being denied the concession.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/312, which is a \r\n    Hanbali book:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he travels in order to break the fast, they both \r\n    become haraam for him, i.e., travelling and breaking the fast, because there \r\n    is no reason for his travelling except breaking the fast. It is haraam for \r\n    him to break the fast because he has no legitimate reason to allow him to do \r\n    that, and it is haraam for him to travel because it is a means to break the \r\n    fast in a haraam manner.

This is the \r\n    view of Abu Haneefah&hellip;. The other view is that they do not have to refrain \r\n    from eating and drinking for the rest of the day. This is the view of Maalik \r\n    and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.

Is this correct? What is the evidence for that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, what you have heard, that I said that if a menstruating \r\n    woman becomes pure during the day, she may eat and drink and need not \r\n    refrain from that for the rest of the day, and that the same applies to a \r\n    traveler who comes home during the day, is correct. This is one of the two \r\n    views narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him), and it is \r\n    also the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah have mercy on them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Whoever eats at the beginning of the day let him \r\n    eat at the end.&rdquo; And it was narrated that the faqeeh Jaabir ibn Yazeed, \r\n    Abu&rsquo;l-Sha&rsquo;tha&rsquo;, who was one of the imams of the Taabi&rsquo;een, came home from a \r\n    journey and found that his wife had become pure from her menses that day, so \r\n    he had intercourse with her. These two reports were narrated in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, \r\n    without comment. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because there is no point in refraining from eating or \r\n    drinking, since fasting is only valid if done from Fajr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And it is permissible for these people not to fast at the \r\n    beginning of the day, even though they know that it is Ramadaan. Allaah has \r\n    only commanded us to refrain from eating and drinking from the beginning of \r\n    the day, from the time of Fajr (dawn), but at that time these people were \r\n    not subject to this obligation, so they were not required to refrain from \r\n    eating and drinking.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah has commanded \r\n    travelers and menstruating women to make up the fast from other days.

If the reason was travelling then he would not have explained it as being in order to gain strength to face the enemy, rather he would have \r\n    said it was because of travelling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Manaawi said in <i>Fayd al-Qadeer<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He said, &ldquo;You are going to meet your enemy in the morning.&rdquo; According to another version, &ldquo;You \r\n    have come close to your enemy&hellip;&rdquo; From the fact that he gave the reason as their approaching the enemy and their needing physical strength to meet \r\n    their enemy, it may be understood that in this case the fast was broken because of jihad, not because of travelling. If the enemy attacked them in \r\n    their own land [i.e., when they were not travelling] and they needed physical strength, then it would be permissible for them to break their fast, \r\n    based on what is said, because that is more necessary than breaking one's fast just because of travelling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said in <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> \r\n    (2\/53-54):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) commanded them to break their fast when they got close to their enemy so that they would have the strength to fight them. If \r\n    such a situation happened when they were not travelling, and breaking their fast would make them stronger to face their enemy, would they be \r\n    allowed to break their fast? There are two opinions on this matter, the one which is based on the soundest evidence is that they are allowed to do \r\n    that. This is the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah, and this is the view stated in the fatwa he issued to the Muslim troops when they met the enemy \r\n    on the outskirts of Damascus. Undoubtedly breaking the fast for that reason is more necessary than breaking it for travelling alone, rather the \r\n    fact that the traveller is allowed not to fast alerts us to the fact that it is allowed in this situation (i.e., jihad), for it is more apt that \r\n    it be allowed in this case because physical strength in that case only benefits the traveller himself, whereas in this case it benefits the \r\n    mujahid and the Muslims, and because the hardship of jihad is greater than the hardship of travel, and because the interest served by the mujahid \r\n    not fasting is greater than the interest served by the traveller not fasting. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And make ready against them all you can \r\n    of power&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Anfaal 8:60]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Breaking one&rsquo;s fast when meeting the enemy is \r\n    one of the greatest means of strength and power&hellip; and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when they drew close to \r\n    their enemy: &ldquo;You are approaching your enemy and breaking the fast will make you stronger.&rdquo; This was a concession, and some of us fasted and some \r\n    of us broke our fast. Then we stopped to camp again, and he said, &ldquo;You are going to meet your enemy in the morning, and breaking the fast will \r\n    make you stronger, so break your fast.&rdquo; So we had no choice but to break our fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So he gave the reason that they were approaching the enemy and they needed their physical \r\n    strength to meet the enemy. This is a reason other than travel. Travel is a separate reason in and of itself, and he did not mention it or refer \r\n    to it here. So in conclusion the principles and wisdom of the Lawgiver dictate that breaking one's fast for the purpose of jihad is more necessary \r\n    than doing so simply because of travelling. So how about if the reason is explained and stated clearly in the text? The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) insisted that they should break their fast for that reason, and this is indicated by the report narrated by &lsquo;Eesa \r\n    ibn Yoonus from Shu&rsquo;bah from &lsquo;Amr ibn Dinar who said: I heard Ibn &lsquo;Umar say: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said to his companions on the day of the Conquest of Makkah: &ldquo;This is a day of fighting, so break your fast.&rdquo; He named fighting as the \r\n    reason, and used the word &ldquo;fa&rdquo; (= so) when issuing the command to fight. From this wording each of them understood that breaking the fast was for \r\n    the purpose of fighting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The battle mentioned by Ibn al-Qayyim (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) took place between the Muslims and the Tatars in 702 AH, and the Muslims were the victors.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He &ndash; meaning Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) &ndash; issued a fatwa telling the people to \r\n    break their fast for the duration of the fighting, and he himself also broke his fast. He used to go around among the soldiers and commanders, \r\n    eating some food that he had in his hand, to show them that it was better for them to break their fast so that they would have more strength to \r\n    fight. Then the people ate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>See <i>al-Bidaayah wa&rsquo;l-Nihaayah<\/i>, 14\/31.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6563","question_id":"6563","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>So long as you are working as a member of the cabin crew in an airplane, you are \r\n    travelling, and the scholars are agreed that it is permissible for the traveller to break his fast during Ramadaan, whether it is difficult for \r\n    him to fast or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is preferable for the traveller to fast, so long as fasting does not cause him \r\n    hardship, in which case it is better for him to break his fast and make up the days that he did not fast later on.

If we know the context of the hadeeth and the reason why it was narrated, that will become clear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari (1946) and Muslim (1115) narrated \r\n    from Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was on \r\n    a journey, and he saw a crowd of people and a man who was being shaded. He said, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;He is fasting.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It is not \r\n    an act of righteousness to fast whilst travelling.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Sindi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The words &ldquo;It is not an act of righteousness \r\n    &hellip;&rdquo; mean it is not an act of obedience or worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What it means is that if it is too difficult \r\n    for you to fast and you fear that it may harm you.

He introduced it by saying:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Chapter: The words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to one who was being shaded when the heat was too intense, &lsquo;It is not an act of righteousness to fast \r\n    when travelling.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>By this introduction he indicated that the \r\n    reason why the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said &ldquo;It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling&rdquo; is the \r\n    hardship that was mentioned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said in <i>Tahdheeb al-Sunan<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the words &ldquo;It is not an act of \r\n    righteousness to fast when travelling&rdquo;, this was said concerning a specific person whom the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) saw being shaded and fasting had exhausted him. So he said these words, i.e., it is not an act of righteousness for a person \r\n    to exhaust himself to this extent when Allaah has allowed him not to fast. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This hadeeth cannot be interpreted in general \r\n    terms to mean that it is not an act of righteousness to fast on any type of journey, because it is proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to fast when travelling. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence al-Khattaabi (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>These words were spoken for a reason, so they \r\n    are limited to those who are in a similar situation. It is as if he said that it is not an act of righteousness for a traveller to fast if fasting \r\n    will lead to him suffering in such a manner.

Based on this evidence the view of \r\n    al-Shafaa&#8217;i, which is that fasting is better in the case of one for whom \r\n    fasting and not fasting are the same, is most likely to be correct.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &#8211; If not fasting is easier for him, then in this case we \r\n    say that not fasting (when traveling) is better. If something will give him \r\n    hardship, then in his case fasting becomes makrooh, because doing something \r\n    that causes hardship when there is a concession indicates that one is \r\n    spurning a concession granted by Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &#8211; If it will case unbearable difficulty, then in this case \r\n    it becomes haraam for him to fast. The evidence for that is the report \r\n    narrated by Muslim from Jaabir ibn &#8216;Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them), that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) went out to Makkah in the year of the Conquest in Ramadaan, and \r\n    fasted until he reached Kuraa&#8217; al-Ghameem. The people were fasting, but he \r\n    called for a cup of water and lifted it up so that the people could see it, \r\n    then he drank it. After that, he was told that some of the people had \r\n    continued to fast. He said, &#8220;Those are the disobedient, those are the \r\n    disobedient.&#8221; According to another report, he was told, &#8220;The people are \r\n    finding it hard to fast, and they are waiting to see what you will do.&#8221; So \r\n    he called for a cup of water after &#8216;Asr. (1114) So he described those who \r\n    fasted even though it was very difficult as being disobedient. See <i>\r\n    al-Sharh al-Mumti&#8217;<\/i> by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him), vol. 6, p. 355).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi and al-Kamaal \r\n    ibn al-Humaam said: the ahaadeeth which indicate that it is better not to \r\n    fast are to be interpreted as referring to those who will be harmed by \r\n    fasting; in some of them this is clearly stated, so they must be interpreted \r\n    in this manner, so as to reconcile between the ahaadeeth. That is better \r\n    than neglecting some of them or claiming that they have been abrogated, \r\n    without definitive evidence to that effect.&nbsp; In the case of those for whom \r\n    fasting and not fasting are the same, they quoted as evidence the hadeeth of \r\n    &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), that Hamzah ibn &#8216;Amr al-Aslami \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): &#8220;Should I fast whilst traveling?&#8221; &#8211; and he \r\n    used to fast a lot.

The legitimate reasons for which one may be excused from fasting are \r\n    as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Sickness&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sickness means everything that means that a person is not \r\n    healthy. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is \r\n    permissible for the sick person not to fast in general. The basis of that is \r\n    the aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number \r\n    (should be made up) from other days&rdquo;[al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Salamah ibn al-Akwa&rsquo; (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo;When this aayah was revealed &ndash; <i>\r\n    &lsquo;And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old \r\n    man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) \r\n    (for every day)&rsquo; [al-Baqarah 2:184 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i> \r\n    &ndash; those who wanted not to fast could do that, and pay the fidyah (i.e., feed \r\n    one poor person for each day). That remained the case until the following \r\n    aayah was revealed, i.e., the verse:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&lsquo;And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an \r\n    old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor \r\n    person) (for every day)&rsquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:185 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i> \r\n    &ndash; so it abrogated it.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The sick person who fears that fasting may make his sickness \r\n    worse or that it will slow down his recovery or damage a part of his body, \r\n    has the option of not fasting, and indeed it is Sunnah for him not to fast \r\n    and it is makrooh for him to complete his fast, because that may lead to his \r\n    death. So he has to be cautious and protect himself. Moreover, if the sick \r\n    person is very ill, that makes it permissible for him not to fast. But if a \r\n    healthy person fears difficulty or tiredness, it is not permissible for him \r\n    to break his fast, if all that happens to him when he fasts is that he \r\n    becomes tired.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Travelling&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In order for traveling to result in a concession excusing one \r\n    from fasting, the following conditions must be met:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    a-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The journey must be long enough \r\n    that prayers may be shortened.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    b-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The traveler must not intend to \r\n    settle in the place to which he travels.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    c-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>His journey must not be for any \r\n    sinful purpose, rather it should be for a sound purpose, according to the \r\n    majority of scholars. That is because being allowed not to fast is a \r\n    concession and relief that the sinner does not deserve on his journey, \r\n    because the purpose of his journey is to commit sin &ndash; such as one who \r\n    travels in order to commit banditry, for example.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Cancellation of the concession for traveling:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This concession of traveling is cancelled by two things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When the traveler returns home \r\n    and enters his hometown, which is the place where he resides.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When the traveler decides to \r\n    stay indefinitely, or for a lengthy period in one place, and the place is \r\n    fit for settling in. Thus he becomes a resident (or non-traveller), so he \r\n    should pray his prayers in full and not break his fast in Ramadaan, because \r\n    the rulings on travel no longer apply to him.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Pregnancy and breastfeeding&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo; are agreed that pregnant and breastfeeding women \r\n    may break their fast in Ramadaan, on the condition that they think there is \r\n    a risk that they or their children may become ill or more ill, or be harmed \r\n    or may die. The evidence for this concession in their case is the aayah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of \r\n    days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other \r\n    days&rdquo;[al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This does not refer to \r\n    merely being sick, for the sick person who will not be harmed by fasting is \r\n    not allowed to break the fast; here sickness is mentioned as a metaphor for \r\n    any situation where fasting when sick may cause harm. This is what is meant \r\n    by sickness here. That may be the case in pregnancy and when breastfeeding, \r\n    so these two cases are included in the concession of breaking the fast. The \r\n    evidence that women in these cases are allowed not to fast is the hadeeth of \r\n    Anas ibn Maalik al-Ka&rsquo;bi (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Allaah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of prayer, and He has \r\n    relieved the pregnant and breastfeeding woman of fasting.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Senility and old age&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Senility and old age refers to one who is old and has lost \r\n    his strength, or who is approaching death, so that every day he becomes \r\n    weaker, until he dies, or who is suffering from a terminal or incurable \r\n    illness and has no hope of recovery. The evidence that it is prescribed for \r\n    such people not to fast is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an \r\n    old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor \r\n    person) (for every day)&rdquo;[al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that this \r\n    aayah has not been abrogated, and it applies to old men and old women who \r\n    cannot fast, so for each day they should feed one poor person.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Intense hunger and thirst&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person is overtaken by intense hunger or unbearable \r\n    thirst, then he should break his fast and eat just as much as he needs to \r\n    ward off that hunger, then he should refrain from eating for the rest of the \r\n    day, and make up that fast later on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars added to intense hunger and thirst the fear of \r\n    weakness when meeting the enemy, or fearing or expecting an attack, such as \r\n    when one is surrounded. So if a fighter knows for sure or thinks it most \r\n    likely that there will be fighting because he is facing the enemy, and he \r\n    fears that fasting may make him weak when fighting, and he is not traveling, \r\n    then he may break his fast before fighting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; Compulsion&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Compulsion means one person forcing another to do something \r\n    or not to do something against his will, by means of threats.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah, vol. 28, p. 73."},{"id":"6567","question_id":"6567","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Drinking Zamzam water is not obligatory, rather it is \r\n    mustahabb, but it is not mustahabb only after praying the two rak&rsquo;ahs behind \r\n    the Maqaam, rather drinking from Zamzam is mustahabb at all times.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (16\/144):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is mustahabb to drink \r\n    Zamzam water and to drink one&rsquo;s fill of it, and to make whatever Islamically \r\n    prescribed du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s one wants when drinking it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Muwaffaq said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is mustahabb to come \r\n    to Zamzam and drink from its water for the one who wants to, and to drink \r\n    one's fill of it.

We have already \r\n    mentioned in the answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]20165[\\fatin] that what is better is what is \r\n    easier. For those for whom fasting when traveling is not too difficult, then \r\n    fasting is better, and for those for whom fasting is too difficult whilst \r\n    traveling, not fasting is better, especially for one who is doing &lsquo;umrah, \r\n    because he needs physical strength in order to do &lsquo;umrah properly, with \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and proper focus and humility.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people who do &lsquo;umrah make it difficult for themselves by \r\n    doing &lsquo;umrah whilst fasting, even though fasting is very difficult for them, \r\n    which affects the way they do &lsquo;umrah. It was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to break his fast on the \r\n    Day of &lsquo;Arafah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shawkaani said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting the day of &lsquo;Arafah is mustahabb for everyone, but it \r\n    is makrooh for those who are in &lsquo;Arafah for Hajj. The reason for that is \r\n    that it may lead to the pilgrim becoming too weak to offer du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and \r\n    remember Allaah (dhikr) on the Day of &lsquo;Arafaah in that place and to do the \r\n    actions of Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was proven in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade singling out Friday for \r\n    fasting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is makrooh to single \r\n    out Friday for fasting unless that coincides with one&rsquo;s habit [e.g. fasting \r\n    alternate days], but if a person fasts the day after or the day before as \r\n    well, or it coincides with his habits, such as if he vowed to fast the day \r\n    when he was healed forever, and that happens to be a Friday, then it is not \r\n    makrooh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars said: The reason why it is forbidden is that \r\n    Friday is a day of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, dhikr and worship, such as doing ghusl, going to \r\n    the prayer early and waiting for the prayer, listening to the khutbah and \r\n    doing a lot of dhikr afterwards. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Then when the (Jumu&lsquo;ah) \r\n    Salaah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the \r\n    Bounty of Allaah (by working), and remember Allaah much&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Jumu&rsquo;ah 62:10]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And there are other acts of worship to be done on this day, \r\n    so it is mustahabb not to fast on Friday, because that helps one to do these \r\n    duties in an energetic manner and to enjoy them without getting tired or \r\n    bored. This is similar to the situation of the pilgrim on the Day of &lsquo;Arafah \r\n    in &lsquo;Arafah &ndash; the Sunnah is for him not to fast as stated above, for the same \r\n    reason. If some one were to say: if a person fasts another day as Friday \r\n    that will still make him tired and affect his worship. The answer is that by \r\n    fasting an extra day he will gain reward that will make up for any \r\n    shortcomings in his worship on Friday. This is the reason why it is \r\n    prohibited to single out Friday for fasting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked in <i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i> \r\n    (p. 464) about a traveler who reaches Makkah fasting: should he break his \r\n    fast in order to have more strength to do &lsquo;umrah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We say: when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) entered Makkah on the twentieth of Ramadaan in the year of the \r\n    Conquest, he broke his fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is proven in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not fast for the rest \r\n    of the month, because he was traveling. The journey of the pilgrim doing \r\n    &lsquo;umrah does not end when he reaches Makkah, and he does not have to refrain \r\n    from eating etc if he comes not fasting. Some people may continue to fast \r\n    even when traveling, because fasting whilst traveling nowadays is not a \r\n    hardship for the ummah, so they continue to fast whilst traveling then come \r\n    to Makkah feeling very tired, and they wonder whether they should continue \r\n    their fast or not, or should they delay &lsquo;umrah until after they have broken \r\n    the fast, or break the fast in order to do &lsquo;umrah straight after reaching \r\n    Makkah?<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We say to them in this case: it is better for you to break \r\n    your fast in order to do &lsquo;umrah as soon as you reach Makkah, when you are \r\n    still feeling energetic, because the Sunnah is for the one who comes to \r\n    Makkah for pilgrimage to hasten straight away to do these rituals. When the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah for \r\n    the purpose of pilgrimage he would hasten to the mosque, and he used to make \r\n    his camel stop at the mosque and go in to do his rituals that he had come to \r\n    do. Not fasting so that you will be able to do &lsquo;umrah in an energetic manner \r\n    during the day is better than continuing to fast and then doing &lsquo;umrah after \r\n    you break your fast at night. It was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was fasting when he was traveling to \r\n    conquer Makkah, then the people came to him and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, fasting is proving too hard for the people, and they are waiting to \r\n    see what you will do.&rdquo; And that was after &lsquo;Asr. So the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked for a drink of water and drank it \r\n    whilst the people were looking on. So he broke his fast whilst traveling, \r\n    and he even broke his fast towards the end of the day, all in order to show \r\n    his ummah that that is permissible. Making oneself fast whilst traveling \r\n    even though it is too difficult is undoubtedly contrary to the Sunnah, and \r\n    the following words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) apply in this case: &ldquo;It is not righteousness to fast whilst \r\n    traveling.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your fasting whilst traveling will affect your performance of &lsquo;umrah, then it is better for you to break your fast and make that day up later on.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6568","question_id":"6568","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person finds himself in a country where the people have already\r\n    started fasting, he must fast with them, because he must follow the ruling of the country\r\n    he is in.

The sanctity \r\n    of the day was waived in their case, but when their excuses ceased to exist \r\n    during the day, they would not benefit from refraining from eating and \r\n    drinking, but they have to make up that day after Ramadaan ends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a traveller reaches home and he is not fasting, then he is \r\n    not obliged to refrain from eating and drinking, and he may eat and drink \r\n    for the rest of the day, because refraining will not benefit him in any way, \r\n    as he is required to make up this day.

We say that two views have been \r\n    narrated concerning that from Imam Ahmad, one of which &ndash; which is the \r\n    well-known view of the madhhab &ndash; is that she must refrain from eating and \r\n    drinking. The other view is that she does not have to refrain, and it is \r\n    permissible for her to eat and drink. We say that the second view is the \r\n    view of Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah have mercy on them), and this is \r\n    what is narrated from Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), because \r\n    he said, &ldquo;The one who ate at the beginning of the day, let him eat at the \r\n    end of it&rdquo;. And we say that what the seeker of knowledge must do with regard \r\n    to matters concerning which there is a difference of opinion is to look at \r\n    the evidence, and to adopt the view which he believes to be most correct and \r\n    not to pay attention to any other opinion so long as he has evidence, \r\n    because we are enjoined to follow the Messengers, as Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;And (remember) the Day (Allaah) \r\n    will call to them, and say: &lsquo;What answer gave you to the Messengers?&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Qasas 28:65]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to quoting \r\n    as evidence the saheeh hadeeth in which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued the command to fast &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; during \r\n    the day, and the people refrained from eating and drinking for the rest of \r\n    the day, we say: they have no evidence in this hadeeth, because fasting the \r\n    day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; is not like a case when the reason for not fasting ceases \r\n    to exist. Rather it is confirming the obligation of fasting. There is a \r\n    difference between the cessation of a reason not to do something and \r\n    confirmation that something is obligatory, because what confirming that \r\n    something is obligatory means is that the ruling that it is obligatory was \r\n    not there before, whereas the cessation of a reason not to do something \r\n    means that the ruling is established but there is a reason not to follow \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A similar case would be \r\n    if a kaafir became Muslim during the day. If a person becomes Muslim the \r\n    obligation is confirmed for him. And a similar case is if a boy reaches \r\n    puberty during the day when he is not fasting; the obligation is confirmed \r\n    for him. So we say to the one who became Muslim during the day: you have to \r\n    refrain from eating and drinking, but you do not have to make up this day. \r\n    And we say to the boy who reached puberty during the day: you have to \r\n    refrain from eating and drinking, but you do not have to make up this day. \r\n    This is unlike a menstruating woman who becomes pure; in that case the \r\n    scholars are unanimously agreed that she has to make up that day. If a \r\n    menstruating women becomes pure during the day, the scholars are unanimously \r\n    agreed that if she refrains from eating and drinking for the rest of the \r\n    day, that will not benefit her and it will not count as fasting, and she has \r\n    to make up that day. Hence we can see the difference between confirmation of \r\n    the obligation and the cessation of a reason not to do something.

Indeed Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n      <i>&ldquo;but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be \r\n      made up) from other days&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>. The Prophet (blessings \r\n      and peace of Allah be upon him) both fasted and broke the fast when \r\n      travelling, as did his Companions. So if a person breaks the fast, there \r\n      is nothing wrong with it, and if he fasts, there is nothing wrong with \r\n      it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Breaking the fast is a concession granted by Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, to travellers whether the traveller is travelling by \r\n    car or camel or ship or airplane. There is no differentiation in that. The \r\n    traveller may break his fast during Ramadan, but if he fasts there is \r\n    nothing wrong with it. If it is too difficult for him to fast, then it is \r\n    better for him not to fast. For example, if it is hot and difficult, then it \r\n    is better not to fast. Not fasting is emphasised so that one may avail \r\n    oneself of a concession granted by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. \r\n    In the hadeeth it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah loves you to avail yourself of His concessions as \r\n    He hates you to commit acts of disobedience towards Him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is very hot, then the Sunnah is to break the fast. The \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man being shaded. \r\n    He asked about that and they said: He is fasting. He (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It is not righteousness to fast whilst travelling&rdquo; \r\n    -- i.e., for the one for whom it is too difficult. But for the one who is \r\n    not harmed by that and it is not difficult for him, then he has a choice: if \r\n    he wants to he may fast, and if he wants to he may break the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But with regard to those drivers who spend their lives on the \r\n    road, the correct view is that there is nothing wrong with it even if \r\n    travelling is his profession. Those who are driving all the time, such as \r\n    taxi drivers and so on, are like those who were always travelling by camel \r\n    in the past. Such a person may break the fast even if he is always \r\n    travelling, but when he comes to his home city, he should fast and refrain \r\n    from eating and drinking. But whilst he is travelling and moving from one \r\n    city to another, he may break the fast even if this is his profession.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him)&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala al-Darb, 3\/1230"},{"id":"6571","question_id":"6571","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the pilgrim doing &lsquo;Umrah in Ramadan comes from a far land \r\n    such as Najd or elsewhere, then he is a traveller and he may break the fast \r\n    on the road, whether he is coming from Riyadh or al-Qaseem or Haa&rsquo;il or \r\n    Madeenah.

Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>\r\n    &ldquo;and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number (of days which one did \r\n    not observe Saum (fasts) must be made up) from other days&rdquo; [al-Baqarah \r\n    2:185]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person is in his home, \r\n    then he decides to travel, he is not called a traveller until he has passed \r\n    beyond the built-up area of his city. So it is not permissible for him to \r\n    avail himself of the concessions of travel, such as not fasting and \r\n    shortening the prayers, just because he has the intention of travelling. \r\n    That is because Allah, may He be exalted, has only made breaking the fast \r\n    permissible for the traveller, and he is not a traveller until he has passed \r\n    beyond (the boundary) of his city.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i> (4\/347), after mentioning that the one who travels during the \r\n    day may break the fast: &hellip; it is not permissible for him to break the fast \r\n    until he has left the houses behind, i.e., he has passed beyond them and \r\n    emerged from the built-up area. Al-Hasan said: He may break the fast in his \r\n    house, if he wishes, on the day that he is going to depart. Something \r\n    similar was narrated from &lsquo;Ata. Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr said: The view of al-Hasan \r\n    is an odd (<i>shaadhdh<\/i>) view; no one who is not travelling has no right, \r\n    on the basis of either rational thinking or reports, to break the fast; and \r\n    the opposite was also narrated from al-Hasan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Then Ibn Qudaamah said: \r\n    (That is also) because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) \r\n    the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm \r\n    (fasts) that month&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>. This one who is present at his \r\n    home (and is not travelling) is not described as a traveller until he has \r\n    left the city. So long as he is in the city, he comes under the heading of \r\n    those who reside there (and are not travelling), hence he may not shorten \r\n    the prayers.

Does he have to offer expiation?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: It is haraam \r\n    for him to break the fast when he is in his house, but if he broke the fast \r\n    before leaving his house, then he only has to make up the fast.

He also has to repent and make up that \r\n    day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>His wife also has to do the \r\n    same if she was willing.

If a person failed to \r\n    do an obligatory duty and did not know that it is obligatory, or he did \r\n    something forbidden and did not know that it is forbidden, this is the one \r\n    who is ignorant and may be excused for his ignorance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You may only be excused in \r\n    your case if you did not know that this action of yours was haraam in the \r\n    first place, or you thought that the one who has decided to travel can do \r\n    that when he is still in his house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But in the case of one who \r\n    knew that this action is forbidden, and he did it but was unaware of the \r\n    punishment that results from it, this is not regarded as an excuse, because \r\n    in this case the person went ahead and committed the sin and transgressed \r\n    the sacred limits knowingly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence in the case of the \r\n    Sahaabi who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan, the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to offer \r\n    expiation, and he did not let him off because of his ignorance of (the \r\n    punishment), as was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1834) and Muslim (1111), \r\n    because he had done it deliberately, knowing that it was forbidden. This was \r\n    stated by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in <i>al-Fath<\/i> (4\/207), based on the fact \r\n    that he said &ldquo;I am doomed&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am burnt&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If someone were to say: \r\n    Wasn&rsquo;t the man who came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) ignorant?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The answer is: He was \r\n    ignorant of what he was required to do (after breaking the fast); he was not \r\n    ignorant of the fact that it was haraam. Hence he said &ldquo;I am doomed.&rdquo; If we \r\n    say that ignorance is an excuse, we are not referring to ignorance of the \r\n    consequences of this haraam action; rather what we are referring to is \r\n    ignorance of whether this action is haraam or not. &hellip; Ignorance of the \r\n    consequences of the haraam action is not an excuse; ignorance of whether the \r\n    action is haraam or not is an excuse.<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote from <i>ash-Sharh \r\n    al-Mumti<\/i>&lsquo;, 6\/417&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You have to make up that \r\n    day, and you have to offer expiation, so long as your breaking of the fast \r\n    occurred when you had not yet begun your journey.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Our advice to you is to try \r\n    to fast the two consecutive months on cold or moderate days when the day is \r\n    shorter and there will be less difficulty involved, or during the days of \r\n    annual leave from work and other times when you have the opportunity to do \r\n    what is required of you.

These capsules are placed \r\n    inside a special device which crushes the capsules in order to release the \r\n    medicine, which is inhaled from the device via the mouth. Using these \r\n    capsules invalidates the fast, because some of this powder mixes with the \r\n    saliva and goes down into the stomach.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad al-Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some people \r\n    have asthma and need to use puffers when fasting.

We ask \r\n    Allaah to keep us and them safe and sound. Two types of medicine are used, \r\n    one of which is known as capsules.

If he uses it \r\n    in the case of necessity then he has broken his fast and may eat and drink \r\n    for the rest of the day, and make up another day in its place. If it so \r\n    happens that this sickness is ongoing, then he is like an old man who has to \r\n    feed one poor person for each day, and he does not have to fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second \r\n    type of asthma medicine is a gas which contains nothing but air which opens \r\n    the airways so that the person can breathe easily.

It also adds some chemical and nutrients such as \r\n    sugars and salts etc. to the blood.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After studying the matter and discovering the nature of \r\n    kidney dialysis with the help of some experts in the field, the Standing \r\n    Committee issued a fatwa stating that kidney dialysis invalidates the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send \r\n    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and \r\n    companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked about a person who undergoes kidney dialysis &ndash; does having his blood \r\n    removed during the procedure invalidate his wudoo&rsquo;? How should he fast and \r\n    pray whilst having dialysis done, if that coincides with the time of \r\n    prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to wudoo&rsquo;, it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, because \r\n    the correct scholarly view is that what comes out of the body does not \r\n    invalidate wudoo&rsquo; unless it comes out of either the front or back passage. \r\n    Whatever comes out of those two passages invalidates wudoo&rsquo;, whether it is \r\n    urine, stools or wind. Everything that comes out of the two passages \r\n    invalidates wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to that which comes out of anywhere other than \r\n    the two passages, such as a nosebleed that comes out of the nose, or blood \r\n    that comes out of a wound, and so on, it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo; whether \r\n    in small or large quantities. Based on this, kidney dialysis does not \r\n    invalidate wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to prayer, the patient can join Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, \r\n    and Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;. He can plan his schedule with his doctor, to make \r\n    sure that the dialysis will not take more than half the day, so that he will \r\n    not miss praying Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr on time. He can say to him, for example: \r\n    Schedule the dialysis in the early afternoon, giving me enough time to pray \r\n    Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, or bring it forward so that I will be able to pray Zuhr and \r\n    &lsquo;Asr (afterwards), before the time for &lsquo;Asr ends. What matters is that it is \r\n    permissible to combine the prayers without delaying them. Based on this it \r\n    is essential to plan one&rsquo;s schedule with one&rsquo;s doctor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to fasting, we are not sure about that. Sometimes \r\n    I would say that it is not like cupping, because with cupping blood is taken \r\n    and not returned to the body, and this invalidates the fast as it says in \r\n    the hadeeth. In dialysis blood is taken from the body, cleaned and returned \r\n    to the body. But I am concerned that dialysis involves some nutrients which \r\n    take the place of food and drink. If that is the case then it does \r\n    invalidate the fast. In that case if this is a lifelong condition with no \r\n    hope of recovery, then he should feed one poor person for each day. But if \r\n    it happens intermittently, then he should not fast when he is undergoing \r\n    dialysis and make up that day later on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the substances that are mixed with the blood do not \r\n    include nutrients, rather they simply cleanse the blood, then this does not \r\n    break the fast.

This is the view of Imam \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Imam Ahmad. Al-Jassaas also narrated this from Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; That they have to feed the poor only, and do not have to \r\n    make up the fasts. Among the Sahaabah, this was the view of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). Ibn Qudaamah also narrated this in\r\n    <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (3\/37) from Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Dawood (2318) narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and &lsquo;Ali that \r\n    this phrase &ndash; &ldquo;those who can fast with difficulty&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:184] was a \r\n    concession granted to old men and old women who find it difficult to fast, \r\n    allowing them not to fast and to feed one poor person for each day instead, \r\n    and the same for pregnant and breastfeeding women if they are afraid. Abu \r\n    Dawood said: i.e., for their children &ndash; they may not fast and may feed (the \r\n    poor) instead. Al-Nawawi said: its isnaad is hasan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This was also narrated by al-Bazzaar who added at the end: \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas used to say to a concubine of his who was pregnant: &ldquo;You are \r\n    like one who cannot fast, so you have to pay the fidyah but you do not have \r\n    to make up the fasts.&rdquo; Al-Daaraqutni classed its isnaad as saheeh, as stated \r\n    by al-Haafiz in <i>al-Talkhees<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Jassaas narrated in <i>Ahkaam al-Qur&rsquo;aan<\/i> that the \r\n    scholars differed concerning this issue.

Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: They \r\n    have to pay the fidyah but do not have to make up the fasts. Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: \r\n    They have to pay the fidyah and make up the fasts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who said that they only have to make up the fasts \r\n    quoted the following as evidence:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The report narrated by al-Nasaa&rsquo;i (2274) from Anas, that \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah \r\n    has waived half of the prayer for the traveler, and fasting, and for those \r\n    who are pregnant and breastfeeding.&rdquo; Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>\r\n    Saheeh al-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) stated that the ruling on pregnant and breastfeeding women is like \r\n    the ruling on the traveler. The traveler may not fast and has to make it up \r\n    later, and this also applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women. See <i>\r\n    Ahkaam al-Qur&rsquo;aan<\/i> by al-Jassaas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Analogy to the sick. Just as the sick are allowed not to \r\n    fast and have to make it up later, the same applies to those who are \r\n    pregnant and breastfeeding. See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 3\/37; <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    6\/273.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view was favoured by a number of scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 15\/225.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Pregnant and breastfeeding women come under the same ruling \r\n    as those who are sick. If it is too difficult for them to fast then it is \r\n    prescribed for them not to fast, but they have to make up the fasts when \r\n    they are able to do so, like those who are sick. Some of the scholars are of \r\n    the view that it is sufficient for them to feed one poor person for every \r\n    day they missed, but this is a weak view. The correct view is that they have \r\n    to make up missed fasts, just like travelers and those who are sick, because \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;but if any of you is ill \r\n    or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 15\/227:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view concerning this matter is that pregnant and \r\n    breastfeeding women have to make up the fasts, and what was narrated from \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn &lsquo;Umar, that pregnant and breastfeeding women have to \r\n    feed the poor instead, is a weak view that goes against the shar&rsquo;i evidence. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;but if any of you is ill \r\n    or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Pregnant and breastfeeding women are likened to those who are \r\n    sick, and do not come under the ruling on old men who are unable to fast. \r\n    Rather they come under the ruling on those who are sick, so they should make \r\n    up the fasts when they become able to do so, even if that is delayed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (10\/220):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a pregnant woman fears for herself or her foetus because \r\n    of fasting in Ramadaan, she may break the fast and she only has to make up \r\n    the missed fasts. In this regard she is like one who is sick and is unable \r\n    to fast or fears that fasting will harm him.

There is a difference of scholarly \r\n    opinion concerning this matter. Some scholars say that it is haraam to \r\n    observe naafil fasts before making up days that one owes, because it is more \r\n    important to start with an obligatory action than a naafil one. Some of the \r\n    scholars say that it is permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him0 was asked about combining making up a missed obligation and \r\n    doing something that is mustahabb: is it permissible for a person to do the \r\n    mustahabb action and make up the obligatory action later on, or should he do \r\n    the obligatory action first, such as fasting the day &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; which \r\n    coincides with making up a missed Ramadaan fast?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to \r\n    obligatory and voluntary fasts, what is prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah and what \r\n    makes sense is to start with the obligatory fasts and then do the naafil \r\n    ones, because the obligatory fast is a debt which must be paid, whereas the \r\n    naafil fast is voluntary and is to be done if one can manage it, otherwise \r\n    there is no sin on one. Based on this, we say to the one who owes a missed \r\n    Ramadaan fast: make up what you owe before you observe a voluntary fast. If \r\n    he observes a voluntary fast before making up what he owes then the correct \r\n    view is that his voluntary fast is valid so long as there is still enough \r\n    time to make up the missed fasts, because a person may make up missed \r\n    Ramadaan fasts so long as there is still enough time for him to do so before \r\n    the next Ramadaan comes. So long as there is still plenty of time, it is \r\n    permissible for him to observe voluntary fasts. This is similar to the case \r\n    of obligatory prayers, such as if a person offers a naafil prayer before an \r\n    obligatory prayer when there is still plenty of time, this is permissible. \r\n    Whoever fasts on the day of &lsquo;Arafah or &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, and still owes some days \r\n    from Ramadaan, his fast is valid. But if he has the intention of fasting \r\n    this day to make up for a missed Ramadaan fast, he will have two rewards &ndash; \r\n    one for the day of &lsquo;Arafah or &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; and another for making up the missed \r\n    fast. This applies to all voluntary fasts that are not connected to \r\n    Ramadaan. With regard to fasting the six days of Shawwaal, these are \r\n    connected to Ramadaan and can only be done after making up missed Ramadaan \r\n    fasts. If a person fasts these days before making up his missed Ramadaan \r\n    fasts, he will not get the reward for them, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever fasts Ramadaan then \r\n    follows it with six days of Shawwaal, it will be as if he fasted for a \r\n    lifetime.&rdquo; It is known that the one who still has some days to make up is \r\n    not regarded as having fasted Ramadaan until he makes up those days. Some \r\n    people think that if they fear Shawwaal is going to end soon and they fast \r\n    the six days even though they still owe some days from Ramadaan, that this \r\n    is acceptable. This is a mistake, because these six days cannot be fasted \r\n    until a person has made up the days that he owes from Ramadaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    20\/438.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, it is permissible for you to fast the first \r\n    ten days of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah as a naafil fast, but it is better for you to fast \r\n    them with the intention of making up what you owe of Ramadaan, and you will \r\n    have two rewards in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also question no.

And \r\n    when he repents he should do a righteous deed which is one of the best of \r\n    deeds, namely prayer. So he may draw close to Allaah by means of this in the \r\n    hope that He may accept his repentance and forgive his sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; The time for the prayer of repentance&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is mustahabb to offer this prayer when the Muslim has \r\n    decided to repent from the sin that he has committed, whether this \r\n    repentance comes immediately after committing the sin or later on. The \r\n    sinner must hasten to repent but if he delays it, it will still be accepted, \r\n    because repentance is accepted so long as one of the following impediments \r\n    does not occur:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When the soul reaches the \r\n    throat (at death).

The same applies to the prayer of repentance. If a person commits a \r\n    sin, then it is obligatory to repent straight away, and it is recommended \r\n    for him to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs, then repent, as it says in the hadeeth of Abu \r\n    Bakr al-Siddeeq.

The brothers there had split into three groups:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One group said: we will fast with Saudi and break the fast \r\n    with Saudi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another group said: we will fast with the country where we \r\n    are living and break the fast with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The last group said: we will fast Ramadaan with the country \r\n    where we are living, but we will fast the day of &lsquo;Arafah with Saudi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They asked the Shaykh to provide them with a detailed answer \r\n    concerning the Ramadaan fast and fasting the day of &lsquo;Arafah, whilst noting \r\n    that for the past five years, in the country where they were living neither \r\n    Ramadaan nor the day of &lsquo;Arafah had been observed on the same days as in \r\n    Saudi; their Ramadaan started one or two days after it had been announced in \r\n    Saudi, and sometimes three days after.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) differed \r\n    concerning the issue when the moon is sighted in one part of the Muslim \r\n    world and not in another: do all the Muslims have to act on the basis of \r\n    that, or only those who sighted it and the people who live in the same \r\n    region, or only those who sighted it and the people who live under the same \r\n    government? There are many different points of view.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most correct view is that the matter should be referred \r\n    to those who have knowledge of it. If the moon rises at the same point for \r\n    two countries they become like one country, so if it is sighted in one of \r\n    them that ruling applies to the other. But if the rising points differ, then \r\n    each country has its own ruling. This is the view favoured by Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him); this is the apparent \r\n    meaning of the texts of the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and what is implied by \r\n    analogy. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the Qur&rsquo;aan it says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night \r\n    of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm \r\n    (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of \r\n    days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other \r\n    days. Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things \r\n    difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of \r\n    days), and that you must magnify Allaah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allaahu Akbar: \r\n    Allaah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful \r\n    to Him&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is implied by this \r\n    verse is that whoever does not see it is not obliged to fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the Sunnah, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When you see it (the new moon) then fast, and \r\n    when you see it, break your fast.&rdquo; What is implied by this hadeeth is that \r\n    if we did not see it we are not obliged to fast or to break the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to analogy, the times for starting and ending the \r\n    fast each day should be worked out in each country on its own, according to \r\n    the local times of sunrise and sunset. This is a point on which there is \r\n    scholarly consensus. So you see the people in east Asia starting their fast \r\n    before the people of west Asia, and breaking their fast before them, because \r\n    dawn breaks for the former before the latter, and the sun sets for the \r\n    former before the latter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once this is established with regard to the times for \r\n    starting and ending the daily fast, it also applies to the start and end of \r\n    the monthly fast. There is no difference between them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if many regions come under the same government, and the \r\n    ruler gives the command for the fast to start or end, then his command must \r\n    be followed, because this is a matter of scholarly dispute but the command \r\n    of the ruler dispels that dispute.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on the above, you \r\n    should fast and break your fast along with the people of the country where \r\n    you are living, whether that is in accordance with your country of origin or \r\n    not. Similarly on the day of &lsquo;Arafah you should follow the country where you \r\n    are living.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Written by Muhammad al-Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen, 28\/8\/1420 AH.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i><span>Majmoo&rsquo; \r\n    al-Fataawa<\/span><\/i><span>, 19<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6639","question_id":"6639","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is makrooh to single out Saturday for fasting, because of \r\n    the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (744), Abu Dawood (2421) and Ibn Maajah \r\n    (1726) from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Busr, from his sister, that the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not fast \r\n    on Saturdays apart from days when you are obliged to fast.

Also excluded is deliberately singling out Friday for fasting, \r\n    because it was reported that this is not allowed. One of the best forms of \r\n    voluntary fasting is to fast alternate days for those who are able to do \r\n    that, as it says in the hadeeth: &ldquo;The most beloved prayer to Allaah is the \r\n    prayer of Dawood (peace be upon him), and the most beloved fasting to Allaah \r\n    is the fasting of Dawood. He used to sleep half the night, stand in prayer \r\n    for one-third of the night, and sleep for one-sixth, and he used to fast \r\n    alternate days.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 1131; Muslim, 1159). In order for this kind \r\n    of fasting to be regarded as virtuous, it should not weaken a person and \r\n    make him unable to do his primary duties, as it says in the hadeeth: &ldquo;he \r\n    used to fast alternate days, and he never ran away from battle (because he \r\n    used to break his fast at times of jihad).&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 1977; Muslim, \r\n    1159)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Specific voluntary fasts. These are superior to general \r\n    voluntary fasts, and are of two types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The first type is fasts which are specific to a type of \r\n    person, such as young men who cannot get married, as mentioned in the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): &ldquo;We \r\n    were young men with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) and we did not have anything (i.e., we could not afford to get \r\n    married). The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said to us, &lsquo;O young men, whoever among you can afford to get \r\n    married, then let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze \r\n    and guarding chastity. And whoever is not able to do that, then let him \r\n    fast, for that will be a shield for him.&rsquo;&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 5066; Muslim, \r\n    1400).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This kind of fasting is more emphasized so long as a person \r\n    is single, and this prescription is more emphatic the more provocation there \r\n    is. There is no mention of any specific number of days in this case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second type is fasts prescribed at specific times, which \r\n    vary, with some being weekly, some monthly and some annual. The weekly fasts \r\n    are on Monday and Thursday, on which days fasting is mustahabb. It was \r\n    narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to fast on Mondays and Thursdays.&rdquo; \r\n    (al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 2320; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo; \r\n    al-Sagheer<\/i>, 4827). The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and he said: \r\n    &ldquo;Those are two days on which people&rsquo;s deeds are shown to the Lord of the \r\n    Worlds, and I want my deeds to be shown to Him when I am fasting.&rdquo; \r\n    (al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 2358; Ibn Maajah, 1740; Ahmad, 8161; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 1583). He was asked about fasting on \r\n    Mondays and he said, &ldquo;On that day I was born and on that day revelation came \r\n    to me.&rdquo; (Muslim, 1162).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the monthly fasts, it is mustahabb to fast on \r\n    three days of each month. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo;My close friend [i.e., the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him)] advised me to do three things which I will \r\n    never give up until I die: fasting three days each month, praying Duha, and \r\n    sleeping after praying Witr.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 1178; Muslim, 721). It is \r\n    mustahabb to observe this fast in the middle of the hijri month, on the days \r\n    called Ayaam al-Beed. It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: &ldquo;The Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me, &lsquo;If you \r\n    fast any part of the month then fast on the thirteenth, fourteenth and \r\n    fifteenth.&rsquo;&rdquo; (al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 2424; Ibn Maajah, 1707; Ahmad, 210; classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo; al-Sagheer<\/i>, 673).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Annual fasts are observed on specific days, or during periods \r\n    when it is Sunnah to fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The specific days include the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The day of &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo; which is \r\n    the tenth of Muharram. It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) was asked about fasting on the day of &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo;. He said, \r\n    &ldquo;I do not know of any day on the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) fasted that was better than this day and \r\n    any month that was better than this month, meaning Ramadaan.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, \r\n    2006; Muslim, 1132). It is Sunnah to fast the day before or the day after \r\n    along with &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo;, in order to be different from the Jews.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The day of &lsquo;Arafaah, which is the ninth day of \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah. It is mustahabb only for those who are not standing in \r\n    &lsquo;Arafaah itself, as the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said concerning the virtue of the three fasts mentioned \r\n    above: &ldquo;The observance of three days' fast every month and that of Ramadan \r\n    every year is equivalent to fasting for the entire year. I seek from Allah \r\n    that fasting on the day of &lsquo;Arafaah may atone for the sins of the preceding \r\n    and the coming years, and I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of \r\n    &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo; may atone for the sins of the preceding year.&rdquo; (Muslim, 1162).<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The periods during which it is Sunnah to fast include the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The month of Shawwaal. It is \r\n    Sunnah to fast six days of Shawwaal, because the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever fasts Ramadaan \r\n    then fasts six days of Shawwaal, it is as if he fasted for a lifetime.&rdquo; \r\n    (Muslim, 1164).

I never saw the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fast an entire month apart from \r\n    Ramadaan, and the month in which I saw him fast the most was Sha&rsquo;baan. He \r\n    used to fast all of Sha&rsquo;baan or all of it apart from a few days.&rdquo;&nbsp; \r\n    (al-Bukhaari, 1969; Muslim, 1156).<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim who is keen to do good must realize the great \r\n    virtue of performing voluntary fasts for the sake of Allaah, as it says in \r\n    the hadeeth of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \r\n    &ldquo;Whoever fasts one day for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will keep his face \r\n    seventy years&rsquo; distance from Hell,&rdquo; (al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 2247; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>, 2121).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to make us among those whose faces He keeps far \r\n    away from Hell and its heat, and to bless us with Paradise.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>With regard to the precise timing of Suhoor and Iftaar:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As mentioned in the definition of fasting, fasting means \r\n    abstaining from food, drink and all other things that break the fast from \r\n    dawn until sunset, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn \r\n    appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then \r\n    complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:187]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the fasting person must begin to abstain from things that \r\n    break the fast when dawn begins and continue until the sun has set. The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \r\n    concerning the time of iftaar: &ldquo;When the night has come from here and the \r\n    day has gone from here, and the sun has set, then let the fasting person \r\n    break his fast.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 1818; Muslim, 1841). With regard to the time \r\n    of suhoor, the majority of fuqaha&rsquo; said that it is the time from the last \r\n    half of the night until the second dawn. It is Sunnah to delay it, according \r\n    to the majority of scholars, so long as the second dawn has not begun, \r\n    because of the verse quoted above and because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Hasten iftaar and delay suhoor.&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Tabaraani and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 3989). The purpose of suhoor is to give one strength to fast, \r\n    so the closer it is to dawn the more effective it will be in helping one to \r\n    fast. We ask Allaah to make us among those who adhere to His laws and act \r\n    according to them.

Even though al-&lsquo;Ala&rsquo; is the only one who narrated this hadeeth, that is not regarded as detrimental to the hadeeth, because al-&lsquo;Ala&rsquo; is \r\n    thiqah; in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, Muslim narrated a number of ahaadeeth from him, from his father from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). \r\n    Many Sunnahs are narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only through one person who is thiqah, but they have \r\n    been accepted and followed by the ummah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to those who think that there is \r\n    a contradiction between this hadeeth and the ahaadeeth which speak of fasting in Sha&rsquo;baan, there is no contradiction.

He said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is a saheeh hadeeth as Shaykh Naasir \r\n    al-Deen al-Albaani said. What is meant is that it is not allowed to start fasting after halfway through the month.

Thus it becomes \r\n    clear that fasting on these days is not haraam. Otherwise the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said: Fast one day \r\n    and not the next, so long as that (fasting) does not coincide with a Friday \r\n    or Saturday.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 6\/476.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly: With regard to \r\n    your question about the ruling on singling out Friday for fasting in the law \r\n    of Dawood (peace be upon him):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not know anything about the practical rulings of the \r\n    law of Dawood (peace be upon him) with regard to whether it was forbidden to \r\n    fast on Fridays or other days. What we do know is that every Prophet has a \r\n    law and a way, but their belief was one and the same, although their laws \r\n    differed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;To each among you, We have \r\n    prescribed a law and a clear way&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa'idah 5:48]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;The Prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers \r\n    are different, but their religion is the same.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, \r\n    3259; Muslim, 2365.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>What this hadeeth \r\n    means is that the religion of the Prophets is one, which is Tawheed or \r\n    belief in the Oneness of Allaah and that He alone is entitled to worship, \r\n    even though their laws may differ.

In these cases, intentions cannot be combined. For\r\n    example, if a man misses the Sunnah of Fajr, and the sun comes up and the time for Salaat\r\n    al-Duhaa comes, the Sunnah of Fajr cannot take the place of Salaat al-Duhaa, or\r\n    vice-versa. They cannot be combined, because the Sunnah of Fajr is independent, and Salaat\r\n    al-Duhaa is independent, and neither of them can take the place of the other.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The same applies if an act is connected to the one that comes before it\r\n    &ndash; they cannot be combined. So if a man says, &ldquo;I want to have the intention of\r\n    praying both fard and sunnah when I pray Fajr,&rdquo; we would tell him that this is not\r\n    correct, because the Sunnah (of Fajr) is directly connected to the Fard, and cannot take\r\n    its place.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second type is where what is intended is not a specific act of\r\n    worship. In this case, intentions may be combined. For example: a man enters the mosque\r\n    where the people are praying Salaat al-Fajr. It is known that when a man enters the\r\n    mosque, he should not sit down until he prays two rak&rsquo;ahs, so if he joins the imaam\r\n    in that prayer, this is good enough. Why? Because the point is that he should pray two\r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs when he enters the mosque. Similarly, if a man enters the mosque at the time\r\n    of Salaat al-Duhaa and prays two rak&rsquo;ahs with the intention of praying Salaat\r\n    al-Duhaa, he does not have to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid as well, but if he has the intention\r\n    of both, that is better. This is the guideline for combining acts of worship.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In the case of fasting, fasting the Day of &lsquo;Arafaah, for example,\r\n    means that when this day comes you will be fasting, whether you intended it as one of the\r\n    three days which you fast every month or as the Day of &lsquo;Arafaah. But if you intended\r\n    it as the Day of &lsquo;Arafaah, it will not count as one of the three days; but if you\r\n    intended it as one of the three days, that is good enough and will count as the Day of\r\n    &lsquo;Arafaah too. If you intended both, that is preferable. <br \/><br \/>Source: (Liqa&rsquo; al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, 51\/19)"},{"id":"6659","question_id":"6659","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of &lsquo;Arafaah and the fasting that goes with it should be observed in each \r\ncountry according to the local times of fajr and maghrib.

If the Muslim were to fast on that \r\n    day, the fast would keep him from working, and he would give up some things \r\n    that he used to do because of his fast, because fasting makes one thirsty \r\n    and hungry, so he would be like the Jews in not working on this day.

The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If you swear an oath then decide that something \r\n    else is better than it, then do that which is better and offer expiation for \r\n    breaking your oath.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your decision to fast these three days for breaking your oath \r\n    is not acceptable, unless you are unable to feed ten poor persons or to \r\n    clothe them. The expiation for breaking an oath is feeding ten poor persons \r\n    or clothing them, or freeing a slave; whoever cannot do that may fast three \r\n    days. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in \r\n    your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its \r\n    expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale \r\n    of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them \r\n    or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast \r\n    for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And \r\n    protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much).

So we say that if you are going to fast because you are unable to \r\n    feed or clothe poor people, then do not count it as part of these six days \r\n    of Shawwaal. It is not permissible to combine the intention of an obligatory \r\n    deed and the intention of a naafil deed. Fasting in expiation in particular \r\n    requires a separate intention, as is also the case with regard to fasting \r\n    the six days of Shawwaal. Based on that, your fasting three days in \r\n    expiation for breaking your oath cannot be counted as part of the six days \r\n    of Shawwaal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Does fasting six days of Shawwaal and the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; \r\n    and the day of &lsquo;Arafah count as expiation for breaking an oath, if a person \r\n    does not know the number of oaths he made.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The expiation for breaking the oath is freeing a believing \r\n    slave or feeding ten poor persons or clothing them. If a person is unable to \r\n    do any of that then he may fast three days for each oath.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to your not knowing the number of oaths, you have \r\n    to strive to make a rough estimate, then offer expiation for whatever oaths \r\n    you broke, and that will be sufficient if Allah Wills.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not acceptable to fast the day of Ashoora&rsquo;, the day of \r\n    &lsquo; &lsquo;Arafah and six days of Shawwaal instead of fasting in expiation breaking \r\n    your oath, unless you intend to fast these days on the basis that they are \r\n    in expiation and not a voluntary fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq \r\n    &lsquo;Afeefi, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, \r\n    23\/37, 38&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A woman is saying that she swore an oath, and she wants to \r\n    expiate for this oath by fasting three days. Is it permissible for her to \r\n    fast them with the six days of Shawwaal, so that she will be fasting six \r\n    days in total?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: it is not permissible for a person who swore an oath \r\n    to fast if he breaks it, unless he is unable to feed or clothe ten poor \r\n    persons, or to free a slave, because Allah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor \r\n    persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own \r\n    families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford \r\n    (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the \r\n    oaths when you have sworn&rdquo; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:89]<\/i>. It has become very \r\n    widespread among many of the common folk who think that expiation for \r\n    breaking an oath is fasting for three days both, but this is a mistake. \r\n    Rather it is not permissible to fast except if the one who has broken his \r\n    oath cannot afford to feed ten poor persons, or he can afford it but he \r\n    cannot find poor people; in that case he may fast three consecutive days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, if it is permissible to combine these three days \r\n    with any other fast; it is not acceptable to intend them as fasting some of \r\n    the six days of Shawwaal, because these are two separate acts of worship and \r\n    one of them cannot take the place of the other. Rather he may fast six days \r\n    of Shawwaal, then fast three extra days in addition to the six days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala al-Darb<\/i>, (\/84, \r\n    85)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not essential that the three days be consecutive.

Is there a principle concerning naafil acts of worship that may be made up and those that may not be made up? May Allah reward you with good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: Naafil acts of worship are of two types: those for which there is a reason and those for \r\n    which there is no reason. Those for which there is a reason end when the \r\n    reason ends, and they cannot be made up. An example of that is tahiyyat \r\n    al-masjid (two rak&lsquo;ahs to &ldquo;greet the mosque&rdquo;). If a man comes and sits down, \r\n    and sits for a long time, then he gets up wanting to pray tahiyyat \r\n    al-masjid, it will not be tahiyyat al-masjid, because that is a prayer that \r\n    is done for a reason and is connected to the reason; once the reason no \r\n    longer applies, it is no longer prescribed. Another example, it would seem, \r\n    is the day of &lsquo;Arafah and the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;. If a person delays fasting \r\n    the day of &lsquo;Arafah and the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, with no excuse, there is no \r\n    doubt that it cannot be made up and it would not benefit him if he did make \r\n    it up, i.e., it would not benefit him in the sense of it being the day of \r\n    &lsquo;Arafah or the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if that day comes when \r\n    a person has an excuse, such as the woman who is menstruating or bleeding \r\n    following childbirth, or a person who is sick, then it seems that it cannot \r\n    be made up in this case either, because it is connected to a specific day \r\n    and the ruling ceases to apply once that day is past.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; \r\n    Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, 20\/43&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if a person is excused \r\n    for not fasting &ndash; such as women who are menstruating or bleeding following \r\n    childbirth, or those who are sick or are travelling &ndash; and he usually fasts \r\n    on that day or he had the intention of fasting that day, then he will be \r\n    rewarded for his intention, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari \r\n    (2996) from Abu Moosa (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If a \r\n    person falls sick or travels, he will have a reward recorded for him like \r\n    that of what he used to do when he was at home and was healthy.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Hajar (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said: &ldquo;He will have a reward recorded for him like that of \r\n    what he used to do when he was at home and was healthy&rdquo; means that he is \r\n    like one who used to do an act of worship then was prevented from doing it, \r\n    but he had the intention that were it not for the obstacle he would have \r\n    continued to do it.

So he (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) liked his deeds to be taken up when he was \r\n    fasting.

The expiation is in this order of preference and \r\n    one cannot move from one degree of it to the next unless one is unable to do \r\n    the first option, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1936) and \r\n    Muslim (1111) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A \r\n    man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: \r\n    I am doomed, O Messenger of Allaah!

In the Qur'aan, Allah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:286].<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This poor man did not have anything, and Allaah does not \r\n    expect anyone to do something that is beyond his means.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you \r\n    can&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Taghaabun 64:16]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the third point of evidence is the general meaning, i.e., \r\n    the general meaning of the shar&rsquo;i principle that there is no obligation in \r\n    the case of incapability, so obligations are waived when one is incapable of \r\n    fulfilling them. This man who had had intercourse during the day in Ramadan \r\n    was not able to free a slave or fast or feed the poor, so we say: You do not \r\n    have to do anything and you are free of obligation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if Allah makes him independent of means in the future, \r\n    does he have to offer expiation or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is: He does not have to do that, because it has \r\n    been waived in his case. Similarly, if Allah makes a poor man independent of \r\n    means, he is not obliged to pay zakaah for past years, because he was poor. \r\n    By the same token, this person who was not able to offer expiation, if Allah \r\n    makes him independent of means, he is not obliged to make it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the evidence from the Sunnah, it is that when the man \r\n    said, I am not able to feed sixty poor persons, the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) did not say: Feed them when you are able to; \r\n    rather he instructed him to feed them when he found the means, and he said: \r\n    Take this and give it in charity. The man said: Is there anyone poorer than \r\n    us?&nbsp; So [the Prophet] said: Feed your family, and he did not say: The \r\n    expiation remains due from you.

What is meant is those for whom it is too difficult \r\n    to fast. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in <i>Fataawa al-Siyaam<\/i> (p.111):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is \r\n    essential to note that the sick may be divided into two categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Those \r\n    for whom there is the hope of recovery, such as those with temporary \r\n    sickness from which there is the hope of recovery.

All they have to do is wait until they are better, \r\n    then fast. If it so happens that the sickness continues and the person dies \r\n    before recovering, then there is no sin on him, because Allaah has only \r\n    enjoined him to make it up from other days, but he died before those other \r\n    days came. This is like a person who dies in Sha&rsquo;baan before Ramadaan begins \r\n    &ndash; so it should not be made up on his behalf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Cases \r\n    where sickness is ongoing, such as cancer &ndash; Allaah forbid &ndash; kidney disease, \r\n    diabetes and similar chronic diseases where there is no hope of recovery. \r\n    These people are allowed not to fast in Ramadaan, but they have to feed one \r\n    poor person for each day, like old men and women who are unable to fast, so \r\n    they may not fast and should feed one poor person for each day. The evidence \r\n    for that in the Qur&rsquo;aan is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an \r\n    old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor \r\n    person) (for every day)&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to the manner of feeding, one has the choice between giving each poor person \r\n    half a saa&rsquo; of food such as rice and the like (i.e., approximately one and a \r\n    half kilograms) or making food and inviting the poor to eat.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari \r\n    said: As for an old man who is unable to fast, after Anas grew old, for one \r\n    or two years he fed a poor person with bread and meat and he did not fast. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Baaz was asked about an elderly woman who was unable to fast &ndash; what should \r\n    she do?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>She should \r\n    feed one poor person for each day, giving half a saa&rsquo; of the local staple \r\n    food, such as dates, rice, etc, which is equivalent to approximately one and \r\n    a half kilograms. This was stated by a number of the companions of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him).

If he is unable to do that then he \r\n    must feed sixty poor persons, giving each one half a saa&rsquo; of the staple food \r\n    of the country. But with regard to one who has intercourse during the day in \r\n    Ramadaan, and who is one of those who are obliged to fast because he is an \r\n    adult, in good health and settled (not traveling), but he was ignorant of \r\n    the ruling &ndash; there is a difference of opinion among the scholars in this \r\n    case. Some of them said that he has to offer the expiation because he was \r\n    negligent and did not bother to ask and find out about the religion. Other \r\n    scholars said that he does not have to offer expiation because of ignorance. \r\n    From this you can know that in order to be on the safe side, you should \r\n    offer the expiation, because of your negligence and not asking about what is \r\n    forbidden for you before you did what you did.&nbsp; If you cannot free a slave \r\n    or fast, it is sufficient for you to feed sixty poor persons for each day \r\n    that you had intercourse.

But if you had intercourse several times on one day, one \r\n    expiation is enough for that.

They are allowed \r\n    not to fast, but they have to make it up. Women who are menstruating or \r\n    bleeding following childbirth are also obliged to break the fast and make it \r\n    up later. If a person breaks the fast in Ramadaan without an excuse, he has \r\n    committed a major sin, and he has to repent to Allaah, but does he have to \r\n    make up the day when he broke the fast?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>That \r\n    depends. If he intended to fast and then broke the fast during the day with \r\n    no excuse, then he has to make it up. If he did not intend to fast at all, \r\n    then the more correct view is that he does not have to make it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Breaking the fast during the \r\n    day in Ramadaan with no legitimate excuse is a major sin, and a person is a \r\n    faasiq (rebellious evildoer) if he does that. He has to repent to Allaah and \r\n    make up the day when he broke the fast. i.e., if he fasts then during the \r\n    day he breaks the fast with no legitimate excuse, then he has sinned and he \r\n    has to make up that day when he broke the fast, because when he started it, \r\n    it became binding on him so he has to make it up, like a vow. But if he \r\n    deliberately did not fast from the outset, with no excuse, then the most \r\n    correct view is that he does not have to make it up, because that will not \r\n    benefit him in any way. The basic principle is that every act of worship \r\n    that is to be done at a specific time, if it is delayed beyond that time \r\n    with no legitimate excuse, it will not be accepted, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action \r\n    that is not in accordance with this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo; \r\n    And because this is a transgression of the sacred limits set by Allaah, and \r\n    transgression of the sacred limits of Allaah is wrongdoing, and the deeds of \r\n    the wrongdoer are not accepted.

If he is not able to do that then he has to feed sixty \r\n    poor persons. No differentiation is made between men and women in this \r\n    regard, if the woman had intercourse willingly, but if she was forced then \r\n    she does not have to offer expiation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the \r\n    breaking of the fast did not involve having intercourse, rather it was by \r\n    eating or drinking etc, then the fuqaha&rsquo; differed as to whether the \r\n    expiation must be offered in that case.

The Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, &#147;Sit down,&#148;\r\n    so he sat down at the back of the gathering.

This is the correct view with regard to giving food in the case of \r\n    offering expiation for breaking a vow, zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce), \r\n    paying zakaat al-fitr, and other cases in which Allaah has enjoined giving \r\n    food.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the question at hand, which is giving food as \r\n    well as making up missed fasts for a person when another Ramadaan comes \r\n    before they made up the fasts they owed, there is a difference of opinion \r\n    among the scholars. We have discussed this matter in detail in the answer to \r\n    question no. 26865, in which we explained that if a person delays making up \r\n    missed fasts until the next Ramadaan because of an excuse such as ongoing \r\n    illness, travel, pregnancy or breastfeeding, then he or she only has to make \r\n    up the fasts, but if there was no excuse, then the one who delayed it has to \r\n    repent and seek forgiveness, and &ndash; according to the majority of scholars &ndash; \r\n    he has to offer a fidyah by feeding one poor person for each day, as well as \r\n    making up the fasts. We stated that the correct view is that the fidyah is \r\n    not required, but if one does that in order to be on the safe side, that is \r\n    good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here we will explain another point, which is what is \r\n    mentioned in your question, that it is permissible to pay the fidyah before \r\n    starting to make up the fasts, because the fidyah is connected to the delay \r\n    in making up the fasts, and it is not connected to beginning to make them \r\n    up. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, it is permissible to pay the fidyah the day \r\n    when one is going to make up a missed fast, or before or after that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (28\/76):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Making up missed Ramadaan fasts may be done at any time but \r\n    the majority limited it to a specific time, which is before the next \r\n    Ramadaan comes, because &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I \r\n    would owe fasts from Ramadaan and I would not be able to make them up until \r\n    Sha&rsquo;baan, because of my concern for the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him). Similarly the first prayer should not be delayed until \r\n    the time of the next prayer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the majority it is not permissible to delay \r\n    making up missed Ramadaan fasts until the next Ramadaan with no excuse, \r\n    because of this hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah. If one delays it he must offer the \r\n    fidyah, feeding one poor person for each day, because of the reports \r\n    narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, Ibn &lsquo;Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them) who said concerning one who owes fasts but did not fast them \r\n    until the next Ramadaan came: He must make them up and feed a poor person \r\n    for each day. This is the fidyah for delaying it. &hellip; And it is permissible to \r\n    give the food before making up the fast, at the same time, or afterwards. \r\n    End quote.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;But it is better &ndash; according to those who say it is \r\n    obligatory to offer the fidyah for delaying making up the fasts, or who \r\n    think that is more on the safe side, to give it before making up the fasts, \r\n    so as to hasten to do good and so as to avoid the consequences of delaying, \r\n    such as forgetting. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Mardaawi al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He may give to the poor whatever is required for expiation, \r\n    and it is permissible to give the food before making up the fast, at the \r\n    same time or afterwards. al-Majd &ndash; i.e., Ibn Taymiyah the grandfather of \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam &ndash; said: It is better to do it before, in our opinion, so as \r\n    to hasten to do good and to avoid the consequences of delaying.

Allaah says in the verses on fasting \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make \r\n    things difficult for you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He \r\n    wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be \r\n    thankful&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa'idah 5:6]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and [Allaah] has not laid upon you in religion any \r\n    hardship&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hajj22:78]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence if something is usually difficult to avoid and cannot \r\n    be avoided, it does not affect the fast &ndash; which includes a person swallowing \r\n    his saliva when fasting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What cannot be avoided, such as swallowing one&rsquo;s saliva, does \r\n    not invalidate the fast, because avoiding that is difficult. This is similar \r\n    to dust on the road and the dust from flour. Even if a person lets saliva \r\n    gather and swallows it deliberately, that does not invalidate his fast \r\n    because it reaches his stomach in a similar way even if he does not let it \r\n    gather.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 3\/16&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Similarly if he sticks \r\n    out his tongue with saliva on it, then brings it back in and swallows what \r\n    is on it (of saliva), that does not break his fast according to the more \r\n    correct view, because however the tongue moves it is regarded as part of the \r\n    inside of the mouth, the nature of which cannot change, so it does not \r\n    matter what is on it (of saliva).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Haashiyat Qalyoobi<\/i>, 2\/72.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the fasting person has to do after rinsing his mouth:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (6\/327):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Mutawalli and others said: If the fasting person rinses \r\n    his mouth he has to spit out the water, but he does not have to dry his \r\n    mouth with a piece of cloth etc,. There is no scholarly dispute on this \r\n    point.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said: He does not have to spit even \r\n    after drinking water when he hears the adhaan for Fajr. There is no report \r\n    from the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) as far as we know to \r\n    suggest that when a person drinks when dawn breaks he has to spit until the \r\n    taste of the water disappears. Rather this is an area in which there is \r\n    lenience.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 6\/428.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Those scholars who think \r\n    that a person should spit after rinsing his mouth do not ask him to spit \r\n    more than once after expelling the water from the mouth. The reason why they \r\n    stipulate spitting is that the water is mixed with the saliva so it does not \r\n    come out just from spitting it out. But they do not recommend going to \r\n    extremes in spitting, because all that is left after that is simply wetness \r\n    and moisture, and cannot be avoided. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah,<\/i> 28\/63&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if anything else is \r\n    mixed with the saliva that can be avoided, then it is essential to spit it \r\n    out, then it will not matter if any trace of that is left after that, like a \r\n    smell etc. This is like what is left from food after suhoor or small pieces \r\n    that break off the siwaak, or bleeding that comes from the gums.

[fatin]37745[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]37937[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]12597[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, there is no justification for those who spit a \r\n    great deal during Ramadaan except for being cautious to avoid something \r\n    which it is not prescribed to be cautious about. This causes dryness in the \r\n    mouth and makes them thirsty, and makes fasting difficult for them. It also \r\n    causes them some hardship, especially if they are in places where spitting \r\n    is not possible or they do not have any handkerchiefs etc with them. This \r\n    may also cause them not to sit for long in the mosques to recite dhikr or \r\n    read Qur&rsquo;aan, so they miss out on these good deeds during this blessed \r\n    month.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to swallowing his wife&rsquo;s saliva, Ibn Qudaamah \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to swallowing the saliva of someone else, this \r\n    invalidates the fast, because he is swallowing something that did not come \r\n    from his own mouth, so it is likened to swallowing something else. If it is \r\n    said that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to kiss her when he was fasting and suck her tongue \r\n    (narrated by Abu Dawood, 2386), our response is that it was narrated from \r\n    Abu Dawood that he said this isnaad is not saheeh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among those who also classed the additional phrase &ldquo;and suck \r\n    her tongue&rdquo; as weak (da&rsquo;eef) is al-Albaani in <i>Da&rsquo;eef Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i>. \r\n    Ibn Qudaamah mentioned two ways of understanding the hadeeth if we assume \r\n    that it is saheeh:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That the two matters are not connected. He said: It may \r\n    be that he used to kiss her when fasting and suck her tongue at other \r\n    times.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The hadeeth does not \r\n    refer to swallowing saliva at all. He said: It may be that he sucked it (her \r\n    tongue) but did not swallow the saliva, because the wetness on her tongue \r\n    was not transferred to his mouth.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 3\/17&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, if neither spouse swallows the saliva of the \r\n    other, the fast is not invalidated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But \r\n    nevertheless, one spouse sucking on the tongue of the other comes under the \r\n    general heading of things that lead to intercourse, and kissing and other \r\n    things that lead to intercourse are forbidden if there is the fear that a \r\n    person&rsquo;s fast will be invalidated by ejaculation. But if he is confident \r\n    that he can control himself then the correct view is that it is permissible \r\n    but makrooh, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) used to kiss his wife whilst fasting.

He does not have to dry his mouth completely from the water used for rinsing. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (6\/327):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Mutawalli and others said: When the fasting person rinses his mouth, he has to \r\n    spit out the water; he does not have to dry out his mouth using a cloth or the like. There is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Chapter: Using fresh or dry siwaak for one who is fasting &hellip; Abu Hurayrah said, \r\n    narrating from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Were it not that it would cause hardship for my ummah, I would have \r\n    commanded them to use the siwaak for every wudoo&rsquo;.&rdquo; Al-Bukhaari said:&nbsp; There is no difference between one who is fasting and one who is not. \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said, narrating from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The siwaak purifies the mouth and is pleasing to the \r\n    Lord.&rdquo; &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; and Qutaadah said: he may swallow his saliva.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz said in <i>al-Fath<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>By using this title, he refuted those who say that it is makrooh for a fasting person to use a \r\n    fresh siwaak.

This is like the \r\n    water used for rinsing the mouth; if the person spits it out from his mouth, it does not matter after that if he swallows his saliva.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The correct view is that use of the siwaak by one who is fasting is Sunnah at the \r\n    beginning and at the end of the day. <i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i>, p. 468&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The siwaak is Sunnah for one who is fasting throughout the day, even if it is \r\n    fresh.

So some may think that it is not permissible to take it at night, \r\n    because it has a lasting effect during the day. But this is mistaken \r\n    thinking.

There is no difference between it and the \r\n    food eaten at sahoor. One of the important reasons for delaying eating \r\n    sahoor is that it gives the body more strength to be able to fast during the \r\n    day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Eat sahoor, for in sahoor there is blessing.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari \r\n    (1823) and Muslim (1095).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the hadeeth of Anas, &ldquo;Eat sahoor, for in sahoor there is \r\n    blessing&rdquo;, what is meant by blessing is reward, or it is blessed because it \r\n    gives one strength and energy to fast, and makes it less difficult.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And it was said that the blessing coming from waking up and \r\n    offering du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; at the end of the night, before dawn.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is most likely that the blessing of sahoor comes from a \r\n    number of things: it is following the Sunnah, differing from the People of \r\n    the Book, it gives one strength for worship, increases energy, wards off the \r\n    bad attitude that may result from being hungry, makes one give charity to \r\n    the one who asks at that time or joins him to eat, it reminds one to \r\n    remember Allah and call upon Him at times when a response is most likely, \r\n    and reminds one to form the intention of fasting for the one who forgot to \r\n    do so before he went to bed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/140&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said, discussing the blessings of sahoor:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of its blessings is that it supplies nourishment to the \r\n    body throughout the day and helps one to be patient in refraining from food \r\n    and drink, even during the long, hot days of summer, whereas when a person \r\n    is not fasting you will find him drinking five or six times a day, and \r\n    eating twice.

This is the Sunnah of the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which \r\n    narrated in many reports. It is proven in the books of saheeh that a number \r\n    of the Sahaabah thought that the words of Allaah <i>&ldquo;until the white thread \r\n    appears to you distinct from the black thread&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:187 &ndash; \r\n    interpretation of the meaning]<\/i> referred to a white string and a black \r\n    string, so one of them would tie strings to his leg and eat until he could \r\n    distinguish the one from the other.&nbsp; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) explained that what was meant by the white thread was \r\n    the day, and by the black the night, but he did not command them to repeat \r\n    their fasts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim said in <i>I&rsquo;laam al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een<\/i> (4\/66):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He (meaning the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) excused those who ate or \r\n    drank deliberately during the day in Ramadaan, not by mistake, because they \r\n    thought that the black and white threads referred to strings, so they would \r\n    eat and drink until they could tell the one from the other when the day had \r\n    begun. He excused them for that and did not tell them to make up the fasts, \r\n    because of their misunderstanding.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked about a young man who \r\n    masturbated in Ramadaan, not knowing that it breaks the fast, when he was \r\n    overcome by desire &ndash; what is the ruling in this case?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The ruling is that he does not have to do anything, because \r\n    we have stated above that the fasting person does not break his fast unless \r\n    three conditions are met: knowledge, remembering and wanting to do that \r\n    thing. See question no. [fatout]28023[\\fatout].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But I say that people should be patient in refraining from \r\n    masturbation because it is haraam.

Some of them said that he has to offer \r\n    expiation, because he failed to ask and try to understand his religion. \r\n    Other scholars said that he does not have to offer expiation because he was \r\n    ignorant.

The basic \r\n    principle with regard to every act of worship that is connected to a \r\n    specific time is that if it is delayed beyond that time with no excuse, it \r\n    will not be accepted, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not in accordance \r\n    with this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo; And this is a transgression \r\n    of the sacred limits of Allaah, and transgressing the sacred limits of \r\n    Allaah is zulm (wrongdoing), and the wrongdoer&rsquo;s deeds are not accepted. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, \r\n    then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:229]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he did this act of \r\n    worship before the time for it began, it would not be accepted from him, and \r\n    by the same token if he does it after the time for it is over, it will not \r\n    be accepted from him, unless he had an excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    19, question no. 45.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6782","question_id":"6782","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Praise be to Allaah for having guided you and enabled you to \r\n    do that which He loves.

He \r\n    said: al-Bayhaqi and others of our companions quoted as evidence for our \r\n    view the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If I tell you to do a thing, \r\n    then do as much of it as you can.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Furoo&rsquo;<\/i> (p. 39 vol. 3):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he delays making up the missed fast until he dies, if that \r\n    was for a valid reason then nothing need be done, according to the three \r\n    imams, because there is no evidence to that effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it is clear that there is nothing confusing about this \r\n    issue, and that fasts need not be made up on behalf of one whose excuse \r\n    remained valid until he died. Similarly, food need not be given to the poor \r\n    on his behalf, unless he was sick with an illness from which there was no \r\n    hope of recovery, in which case food should be given on his behalf, as in \r\n    the case of an elderly person who cannot fast. Food should be given on his \r\n    behalf, because this was required of him when he was alive, instead of \r\n    fasting.

Even if he \r\n    paid ten times the value of the food, it would not be acceptable, because he \r\n    has turned away from what is mentioned in the texts. Similarly with regard \r\n    to zakaat al-fitr, if he paid ten times the value of the food, it would not \r\n    be acceptable in place of a saa&rsquo; of wheat, because the equivalent value is \r\n    not mentioned in the texts. And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not part of this \r\n    matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, we say to the brother who is not able to fast \r\n    because of old age: Feed one poor person for each day, and you may give the \r\n    food in one of two ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Giving it to them in their houses, giving each one \r\n    one-fourth of a saa&rsquo; of rice along with some condiment to accompany it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Making food and inviting a number of poor people whom you are obliged to feed. So if ten days have passed, you could make dinner and invite ten poor people to come and eat, and do that when the next ten days have passed and the next ten. When Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) grew old and became unable to fast, he would feed thirty poor persons on the last day of Ramadaan.

If a person delays that then he \r\n    must offer the fidyah: feeding one poor person for each day, because of the \r\n    report narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, Ibn &lsquo;Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with them) who said concerning the one who has to make up a missed \r\n    fast but does not do so until the next Ramadaan comes: &ldquo;He must make it up \r\n    and feed one poor person for each day.&rdquo; This fidyah is for delaying it.

He has to repent to Allah and make up \r\n    that day on which he broke the fast. In other words, if he fasted and during \r\n    the day he broke the fast with no excuse, then he has sinned. He has to make \r\n    up that day on which he broke the fast, because when he started to fast it \r\n    became binding upon him; because he started it on the basis that it was \r\n    obligatory, he has to make it up, like a vow that must be fulfilled. But if \r\n    he deliberately did not fast at all with no excuse, then the more correct \r\n    view is that he does not have to make it up, because it will not benefit him \r\n    at all, as it will never be accepted from him. The basic principle with \r\n    regard to the act of worship that are connected to a specific time is that \r\n    if it is delayed until that specific time has ended with no excuse, it will \r\n    not be accepted, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours \r\n    will have it rejected.&rdquo; And because he has transgressed the limits set by \r\n    Allah, and transgressing the limits set by Allah is wrongdoing, and good \r\n    deeds are not accepted from the wrongdoer.

It was proven that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.&rdquo; According to another report, &ldquo;Whoever does any \r\n    action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We know of no basis for the celebrations that \r\n    are held during some nights of Ramadaan. The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the \r\n    worst of matters are those which are innovated (bid&rsquo;ah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.

It seems that he should \r\n    focus with proper humility and not hold the Mushaf, rather he should place \r\n    his right hand over his left as is the Sunnah, placing the right hand over \r\n    the left wrist and forearm and placing them over his chest. This is the most \r\n    correct view and is best. Holding the Mushaf will distract him from these \r\n    Sunnahs, and his heart and eyes may become busy following the words on the \r\n    pages and that may distract him from listening to the imam. What I think is \r\n    that not doing that is the Sunnah, and that he should listen attentively and \r\n    not use the Mushaf. If he has knowledge he will be able to prompt his imam, \r\n    otherwise others will prompt him. Then if it so happens that the imam makes \r\n    a mistake and is not corrected, that does not matter, unless it is in Soorat \r\n    al-Faatihah, rather it matters only in Soorat al-Faatihah, because \r\n    al-Faatihah is a pillar of the prayer which is essential.

The best of guidance is in \r\n      following the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and \r\n      following his companions in matters of worship, by doing what they did and \r\n      avoiding what they avoided.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But there is nothing wrong with a worshipper supplicating \r\n    Allaah (du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;) or reciting Qur&rsquo;aan, or remembering his Lord (dhikr), \r\n    without singling out specific verses or soorahs or dhikrs to be recited \r\n    between the rak&rsquo;ahs, and without that being recited in unison, led by an \r\n    imam or anyone else, because that is not narrated in sharee&rsquo;ah. The basic \r\n    principle is to accept what is narrated in sharee&rsquo;ah concerning acts of \r\n    worship, how often they are done, how they are done, when they are done, \r\n    where they are done, the reason why they are done and the way in which they \r\n    are done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad al-&lsquo;Abdari ibn al-Haaj said in his book <i>\r\n    al-Madkhal<\/i>: Chapter on Dhikr after each two rak'ahs of Taraaweeh \r\n    prayer:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He &ndash; the imam &ndash; should avoid what has been innovated of \r\n    reciting dhikr after each two rak&rsquo;ahs of Taraaweeh prayer and raising the \r\n    voice in that, and reciting it in unison.

This is the same reason why the time when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is answered on \r\n    Friday has not been defined, and why the ninety-names of Allaah have not \r\n    been defined, concerning which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever learns them by heart will enter \r\n    Paradise.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2736; Muslim, 2677.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The words of Imam \r\n    al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) &ndash; &ldquo;Seeking Laylat al-Qadr among \r\n    the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights (of Ramadaan)&rdquo; &ndash; indicate \r\n    that it is most likely that Laylat al-Qadar cannot be in any month other \r\n    than Ramadaan, and is in the last ten nights thereof, and is one of the \r\n    odd-numbered nights, but not on any particular night. This is what is \r\n    indicated by a number of the reports that have been narrated concerning it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/260.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars said: The \r\n    reason why Laylat al-Qadar has been concealed is so that people will strive \r\n    to seek it, because if its timing was known, they would limit their efforts \r\n    to that night only, as we have explained previously about the time on Friday \r\n    (when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are answered).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/266.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, it is not possible for anyone to be certain \r\n    that a particular night is Laylat al-Qadr, especially since we know that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to tell his \r\n    ummah when it was, then he told them that Allaah had taken away that \r\n    knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated from \r\n    &lsquo;Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out with the \r\n    news of Laylat al-Qadr, but two men among the Muslims started arguing.

Perhaps that will be \r\n    better for you. So seek it on the (twenty-) seventh and the (twenty-) ninth \r\n    and the (twenty-) fifth.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 49.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to singling out one night of Ramadaan as Laylat \r\n    al-Qadr, this requires evidence to show that it is this night and not any \r\n    other. But the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights of Ramadaan are \r\n    more likely than others (to be Laylat al-Qadr) and the twenty-seventh night \r\n    is the most likely night to be Laylat al-Qadr, because of the ahaadeeth to \r\n    that effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah li&rsquo;l-Buhooth al-&lsquo;Ilmiyyah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Ifta&rsquo;<\/i>, 10\/413&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the Muslim should not assume that any particular night \r\n    is Laylat al-Qadr, because that would mean that he is being certain about \r\n    something concerning which we cannot be certain, and because it means that \r\n    he is missing out on something that is good for him. It may be the night of \r\n    the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-ninth.

Hence Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) used to like to complete the Qur&rsquo;aan with those whom he led in \r\n    prayer, and this is akin to what the salaf did, namely liking to hear the \r\n    entire Qur&rsquo;aan. But this does not mean that he should rush and not be \r\n    deliberate in his recitation, and not seek to be focused and calm, rather \r\n    seeking these things is better than seeking to complete it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    11\/331-333&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (27\/148):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Hanbalis and most of \r\n    the Hanafi shaykhs &ndash; and it was also narrated by al-Hasan from Abu Haneefah \r\n    &ndash; are of the view that the Sunnah is to complete the Qur&rsquo;aan in Taraweeh \r\n    prayer so that the people can hear the entire Qur&rsquo;aan in that prayer. The \r\n    Hanafis said: The Sunnah is to complete it once. So the imam should not \r\n    forsake completing it because of the people&rsquo;s laziness, rather he should \r\n    recite ten verses or so in each rak&rsquo;ah, and thus he will be able to complete \r\n    it. (This is based on the assumption that he prays twenty rak&rsquo;ahs each \r\n    night.) And it was said that in each rak&rsquo;ah thirty verses should be recited, \r\n    because &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) enjoined that.

If his voice is good and he started to enjoy \r\n    the recitation and feels humble and focused and hopes that this will benefit \r\n    himself and those who are praying behind him, then if he recites some extra \r\n    verses in some rak&rsquo;ahs or on some nights, we do not know of any reason why \r\n    he should not do so.

People are not all the same, rather they \r\n    vary. So he should pay attention to their different situations and encourage \r\n    them to come.

Your staying with your \r\n    family to encourage them to worship is better than your observing i&rsquo;tikaaf \r\n    on your own and depriving them of that help because of your being far away \r\n    from them. &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) told us about what the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do during \r\n    the last ten days, which included waking up his family &ndash; i.e., so that they \r\n    could worship, pray and say du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) did not observe i&rsquo;tikaaf and leave his family with no \r\n    help or care. It is proven that Safiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) \r\n    visited him when he was in i&rsquo;tikaaf and it is proven that they observed \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf with him. I&rsquo;tikaaf is a private act of worship that does not \r\n    benefit anyone else. Your staying with your family and encouraging them to \r\n    worship and treating them kindly is an action that benefits others and you \r\n    will not be deprived of the reward for their worship and you will not \r\n    deprive yourself of worship, because you can accompany your family to qiyaam \r\n    al-layl (night prayers) in a mosque, and you can wake them up at the end of \r\n    the night to say du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and read Qur&rsquo;aan. This is something good that will \r\n    include you and your family. So we advise you to go back to your family and \r\n    stay with them during the last ten days, and encourage them to worship \r\n    Allaah. If you think that your family are doing well, and that they are \r\n    performing acts of worship regularly, then you can observe i&rsquo;tikaaf on some \r\n    nights in your local mosque, so you can combine different kinds of worship \r\n    and attain a great reward in sha Allaah.

But if \r\n    there is the fear of fitnah, then a woman should not be allowed to do it, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade \r\n    things that were less that that. When he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) wanted to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf he went out one day and saw a tent \r\n    for &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and a tent for others of his wives.

They \r\n    quoted several texts as evidence, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; It was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) used to observe i'tikaaf during the last ten nights \r\n    of Ramadaan, Agreed upon. This indicates that the period of i&rsquo;tikaaf is \r\n    counted by the nights, not the days.

This was stated by al-Sindi in <i>Haashiyat al-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/489.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But al-Bukhaari (2041) \r\n    and Muslim (1173) narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said: When the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf, \r\n    he would pray Fajr then enter his place of i'tikaaf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because of the apparent meaning of this hadeeth, some of the \r\n    salaf were of the view that he would enter his place of i&rsquo;tikaaf after Fajr \r\n    prayer. This view was followed by the scholars of the Standing Committee \r\n    (10\/114) and Shaykh Ibn Baaz (15\/442).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the majority of scholars responded to this hadeeth in one \r\n    of two ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had started i'tikaaf before the sun \r\n    set, but he did not enter the place for i&rsquo;tikaaf until after Fajr prayer<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said: &ldquo;When he wanted to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf, he would \r\n    pray Fajr then enter his place of i'tikaaf&rdquo;&nbsp; - this was quoted as evidence \r\n    by those who say that i&rsquo;tikaaf should be started at the beginning of the \r\n    day. This is the view of al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and al-Thawri, and of al-Layth in one of \r\n    his two opinions. Maalik, Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad said: he \r\n    should enter (i&rsquo;tikaaf) before the sun sets if he wants to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf \r\n    for a month or for ten days. They interpreted the hadeeth as meaning that he \r\n    entered the place of i&rsquo;tikaaf in order to be alone there after he prayed \r\n    Fajr, not that this is the time when he began i&rsquo;tikaaf; rather he was in \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf from before Maghrib and stayed in the mosque, and when he had \r\n    prayed Fajr he withdrew to be by himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>al-Qaadi Abu Ya&rsquo;la, one of the \r\n    Hanbalis, responded by interpreting the hadeeth as meaning that he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do that on the \r\n    twentieth. Al-Sindi said: This response is more likely to be correct. \r\n    <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked in <i>Fataawa al-Siyaam<\/i> \r\n    (p. 501): When does i&rsquo;tikaaf begin?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The majority of scholars are of the view that i&rsquo;tikaaf should \r\n    begin on the night of the twenty first, not from Fajr of the twenty-first, \r\n    although some of the scholars are of the view that i&rsquo;tikaaf should begin \r\n    from Fajr of the twenty-first, based on the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with her) that was narrated by al-Bukhaari: &ldquo;When he had prayed \r\n    Fajr he entered his place of i'tikaaf&rdquo;. But the majority of scholars \r\n    responded by stating that the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) withdrew from people in the morning, but the intention to \r\n    observe i&rsquo;tikaaf was formed at the beginning of the night, because the last \r\n    ten nights start when the sun sets on the twentieth. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said (p. 503):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Entering the place of i&rsquo;tikaaf for the last ten nights of \r\n    Ramadaan may be done when the sun sets on the night of the twenty-first, \r\n    because that is the time when the last ten nights begin. This is not \r\n    contradicted by the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah because the wording is different, \r\n    so it should be understood according to what the language indicates. This is \r\n    what was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2041) from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) observed i&rsquo;tikaaf every Ramadaan and when \r\n    he had prayed Fajr he would enter the place where he observed i&rsquo;tikaaf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Her words &ldquo;and when he had prayed Fajr he would enter the \r\n    place where he observed i&rsquo;tikaaf&rdquo; indicate that he was already staying in \r\n    the mosque, meaning that he was in the mosque before he entered he place of \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to coming out of i&rsquo;tikaaf:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should come out when the sun sets on the last day of \r\n    Ramadaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked: When should a person come \r\n    out of i&rsquo;tikaaf? Is it after the sun sets on the night of Eid or after Fajr \r\n    on the day of Eid?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should come out of i&rsquo;tikaaf when Ramadaan ends. Ramadaan \r\n    ends when the sun sets on the night of Eid. <i>Fataawa al-Siyaam<\/i>, p. \r\n    502.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, 10\/441.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The period of i&rsquo;tikaaf \r\n    during the (last) ten nights of Ramadaan ends when the sun sets on the last \r\n    day of the month.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he chooses to stay until he has prayed Fajr and then \r\n    depart from his place of i&rsquo;tikaaf to the Eid prayer, there is nothing wrong \r\n    with that. Some of the scholars regarded that as mustahabb.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Imam Maalik (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) said that he saw that some of the scholars who had \r\n    observed i&rsquo;tikaaf during the last ten nights of Ramadaan did not go back to \r\n    their families until they had attended the (prayer of Eid) al-Fitr with the \r\n    people. Maalik said: I heard that from the righteous people who have passed \r\n    on, and this is the dearest to me of what I have heard about that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (6\/323):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and his companions said: Whoever would like to \r\n    follow the example of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) in observing i&rsquo;tikaaf during the last ten nights of Ramadaan \r\n    should enter the mosque before the sun sets on the night of the \r\n    twenty-first, so that he will not miss any of it, and he should come out \r\n    after the sun sets on the night of Eid, whether the month is twenty-nine \r\n    days or thirty. It is better for him to stay in the mosque on the night of \r\n    Eid so that he can offer the Eid prayer there, or go out to the Eid \r\n    prayer-place if they pray Eid there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he goes directly from i&rsquo;tikaaf to the Eid prayer, it is \r\n    mustahabb for him to do ghusl and make himself look good before going out, \r\n    because this is one of the Sunnahs of Eid.

It is like many Sunnahs which the \r\n    Muslims have virtually forsaken.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are several reasons for this, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Weakness of faith in many \r\n    hearts<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Increased focus on worldly \r\n    pleasures and desires, which leads to an inability to keep away from them \r\n    even for a short time.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Lack on interest in Paradise on \r\n    the part of many, and their inclination towards leisure and relaxation, so \r\n    that they do not want to put up with the hardship of i&rsquo;tikaaf even for the \r\n    sake of earning Allaah&rsquo;s pleasure.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever understands the significance of Paradise and the \r\n    greatness of its delights will sacrifice his life and that which is most \r\n    precious to him in order to attain it. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The reward of Allaah is precious, the reward \r\n    of Allaah is Paradise.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani, 2450.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Many people pay lip-service to \r\n    the love of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \r\n    without acting upon it and implementing various aspects of the Sunnah, \r\n    including i&rsquo;tikaaf.

Ibn Shihaab al-Zuhri \r\n    said: It is strange that the Muslims have given up i&rsquo;tikaaf when the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not give it up from the \r\n    time he entered Madeenah until Allaah took him (in death).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The i&rsquo;tikaaf which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) always observed at the end of his life is i&rsquo;tikaaf \r\n    during the last ten days of Ramadaan. These few days may indeed be regarded \r\n    as an intensive course of spiritual education which brings immediate \r\n    positive results in a person&rsquo;s life during the days and nights of Ramadaan \r\n    and in the coming days, until the next Ramadaan comes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How great is the Muslims&rsquo; need to revive this Sunnah and \r\n    establish it in the proper manner, as the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions used to observe it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How great will be the success of those who adhere to the \r\n    Sunnah after the ummah has neglected it and become corrupt. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic goal of the Prophet&rsquo;s i&rsquo;tikaaf was to seek Laylat \r\n    al-Qadr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslim (1167) narrated that Abu Sa&rsquo;eed al-Khudri (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) observed i&rsquo;tikaaf during the first ten days of \r\n    Ramadaan, then he observed i&rsquo;tikaaf during the middle ten days in a small \r\n    tent at the door of which was a reed mat. He took the mat in his hand and \r\n    lifted it. Then he put his head out and spoke to the people, and they came \r\n    close to him. He said: &ldquo;I observed i&rsquo;tikaaf during the first ten days \r\n    seeking this night, then I observed i&rsquo;tikaaf during the middle ten days. \r\n    Then someone came and said to me that it is in the last ten days, so whoever \r\n    among you wishes to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf let him do so.&rdquo; So the people observed \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth teaches us a number of things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the basic goal of the \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \r\n    to seek Laylat al-Qadr and to prepare to spend that night in worship. That \r\n    is because of the great virtue of that night of which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;The Night of Al&#8209;Qadr (Decree) is better \r\n    than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allaah in that night is better than \r\n    worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months)&rdquo; [al-Qadr \r\n    97:3]<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) strove to seek that night before he was \r\n    told when it is.

The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Five prayers each day and night.&rdquo; He said, Do I \r\n    have to do any (prayers) other than that?

He said: &ldquo;Forty days, a day like a year, a \r\n    day like a month, a day like a week, and the rest of the days like your \r\n    days.&rdquo; We said: O Messenger of Allaah, on that day which is like a year, \r\n    will the prayers of one day be sufficient for us? He said: &ldquo;No. Work out the \r\n    time (for prayer).&rdquo;&nbsp; Narrated by Muslim (2937). He did not regard that day \r\n    that will be like a year as being a single day in which five prayers would \r\n    be sufficient, rather he enjoined praying five prayers every twenty-four \r\n    hours, and he commanded them to space them out during the time based on the \r\n    times on an ordinary day in their country. So the Muslims in the country \r\n    asked about here have to define the times for prayer based on the closest \r\n    country to them in which night is distinct from day, and thus the times for \r\n    the five daily prayers may be known by their shar&rsquo;i signs (in the closest \r\n    country) in every twenty-four hour period. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly they have to fast the month of Ramadaan, and they \r\n    should work out the beginning and end of the month of Ramadaan, and the \r\n    times to start and end the fast every day, and the time of dawn and sunset \r\n    every day, in the closest country to them where night is distinct from day \r\n    and the total of night and day is twenty-four hours, because of the hadeeth \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the \r\n    Dajjaal that we have quoted above, in which he told his companions how to \r\n    work out the times of prayer.

And it was narrated that \r\n    Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It may be that all a \r\n    fasting person gets from his fast is hunger and thirst, and it may be that \r\n    all a person who prays at night gets from his prayer is sleeplessness.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (8693); classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan (8\/257) and by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb<\/i> (1\/262).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Sahaabah and the early \r\n    generations of this ummah were keen for their fasting to be a purification \r\n    for their souls as well as their bodies, free from disobedience and sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: Fasting does not mean abstaining from food \r\n    and drink only, rather it is also abstaining from lying, falsehood and idle \r\n    speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    al-Ansaari said: When you fast, then let your hearing, sight and tongue fast \r\n    from lying and sin and stop abusing servants. Be tranquil and dignified on \r\n    the day of your fast, and do not let the day you do not fast and the day you \r\n    fast be the same.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Hafsah \r\n    bint al-Sireen &ndash; who was a scholar of the Taabi&rsquo;een &ndash; said: Fasting is a \r\n    shield, so long as one does not make holes in it it, and making holes in it \r\n    means gheebah (backbiting).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated from \r\n    Maymoon ibn Mahraam that the least of fasting is giving up food and drink.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>These reports were quoted \r\n    by Ibn Hazm in <i>al-Muhalla<\/i> (4\/308).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So it is no wonder if we \r\n    learn that some scholars regarded the fast as invalid if a person falls into \r\n    sin during his fast, even though the correct view is that this does not \r\n    invalidate the fast, but undoubtedly it detracts from it and goes against \r\n    the real meaning of fasting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Backbiting damages the \r\n    fast. It was narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, and al-Awzaa&rsquo;i also said this, that \r\n    backbiting breaks the fast of the fasting person and he has to make up that \r\n    day. Ibn Hazm went further and said: It is invalidated by every sin that a \r\n    person commits deliberately, when he is aware that he is fasting, whether it \r\n    is an action or a word, because of the general meaning of the words &ldquo;he \r\n    should not utter obscene speech or behave in an ignorant manner&rdquo; and because \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allaah has no need of his \r\n    giving up his food and drink.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> \r\n    (4\/104).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for the thing from one \r\n    which must abstain when fasting, perhaps you will be surprised if I tell you \r\n    that the thing from one which must abstain when fasting is sin. A person \r\n    must abstain from sin when fasting because this is the primary aim of \r\n    fasting, because Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O you who believe! \r\n    Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed \r\n    for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:183]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not so that you may \r\n    become hungry, or so that you may become thirsty, or so that you may refrain \r\n    from relations with your wife! No; He says &ldquo;<i>that you may become \r\n    Al-Muttaqoon (the pious).<\/i>&rdquo; This is the primary aim of fasting. The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) affirmed that when \r\n    he said: &ldquo;Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it and \r\n    ignorant behaviour, Allaah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.&rdquo; \r\n    So if a person refrains from disobeying Allaah, this is true fasting. As for \r\n    outward fasting, this is abstaining from things that invalidate the fast and \r\n    refraining from things that break the fast from dawn until sunset as an act \r\n    of worship towards Allaah, because of the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So now have sexual \r\n    relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you \r\n    (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn \r\n    appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then \r\n    complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:187].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We call this kind of \r\n    fasting outward fasting, which is the fasting of the body only. As for the \r\n    fasting of the heart, which is the primary aim of fasting, this means \r\n    refraining from disobedience towards Allaah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on this, if a person \r\n    observes the fast outwardly, in the physical sense, but he does not fast in \r\n    his heart, then his fast is severely deficient, but we do not say that it is \r\n    invalid, rather we say that it is lacking. Similarly, we say concerning \r\n    prayer that the aim of prayer is humility before Allaah, may He be glorified \r\n    and exalted, and prayer of the heart comes before prayer of the limbs, but \r\n    if a person prays physically but not with his heart, not focusing at&nbsp; all, \r\n    then his prayer is very deficient, but it is still valid as it appears to \r\n    be, but is very deficient. Similarly the fast is very deficient if a person \r\n    does not refrain from disobeying Allaah, but it is valid, because acts of \r\n    worship in this world are to be judged as they appear to be. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Liqaa&rsquo;aat al-Baab \r\n    il-Maftoohah<\/i> (116, p. 1).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars divided \r\n    patience into three categories: patience in obeying Allaah, patience in \r\n    refraining from disobeying Him, and patience in accepting the Divine decree. \r\n    Fasting combines all these kinds of patience. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The best kind of patience \r\n    is fasting, for it combines all three types of patience. It is patience in \r\n    obeying Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is patience in \r\n    refraining from disobeying Him, because a person gives up his desires for \r\n    the sake of Allaah even though his self may be longing for them. Hence it \r\n    says in the saheeh hadeeth that Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, \r\n    says: &ldquo;All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except fasting. It is \r\n    for Me and I shall reward for it, because he gives up his desire and his \r\n    food and drink for My sake.&rdquo; Fasting also involves patience in accepting the \r\n    consequences which may result in hunger and thirst for the fasting person. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Jaami&rsquo; al-&lsquo;Uloom \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Hikam<\/i> (p. 219).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whoever manages to fast as \r\n    Allaah has prescribed will attain a great reward from his Lord, may He be \r\n    blessed and exalted. It is sufficient for him to know that Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Only those who are \r\n    patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Zumar 39:10]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In order for the Muslim to \r\n    protect his fasting from being deficient due to committing sins, he must \r\n    achieve patience in refraining from sin. One of the scholars said that \r\n    patience in refraining from sin is greater than the other two types of \r\n    patience.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Here there is an issue \r\n    which people debated about: which type of patience is better &ndash; patience in \r\n    refraining from sin or patience in obeying Allaah? One group of people \r\n    suggested that the former is better, and they said that patience in \r\n    refraining from sin is the attitude of the siddeeqeen, as some of the salaf \r\n    said: Good deeds are done by righteous and immoral alike, but no one has the \r\n    power to refrain from sin except a Siddeeq, and because the motive to commit \r\n    sin is greater than the motive to stop being obedient, because the motive to \r\n    commit sin is pleasure, but the motive to stop being obedient is laziness \r\n    and sloth, and undoubtedly the motive to commit sin is stronger. They said: \r\n    Sin may be promoted by one's own self, whims and desires, the shaytaan, \r\n    worldly reasons, a man&rsquo;s companions, a desire to imitate, and natural \r\n    inclinations. Any one of these factors may cause a person to commit sin, so \r\n    how about if they are combined and prevail over the heart? What patience can \r\n    be stronger than patience in refusing to respond to them? If Allaah did not \r\n    give him patience, he would not be patient by himself. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This argument, as you can \r\n    see, is very strong and very clear. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Tareeq al-Hijratayn<\/i> \r\n    (p. 414).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Patience in refraining from \r\n    sin stems from a number of things which we hope you will ponder, for that \r\n    contains a description of the disease and a prescription of the remedy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The principle of patience \r\n    in refraining from sin is based on a number of things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Knowledge of how \r\n    reprehensible and vile it is, and that Allaah has only forbidden it as a \r\n    protection against its evil, just as a caring father will protect his child \r\n    from things that will harm him. This reason will make the wise person \r\n    refrain from it, even if he does not pay attention to the warning of \r\n    punishment. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Feeling shy before \r\n    Allaah, may He be glorified. If a person realizes that Allaah is watching \r\n    him and can see him and hear him, he will feel too shy before his Lord to \r\n    expose himself to His wrath.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Remembering the \r\n    blessings He has given you and His kindness towards you. Sins inevitably \r\n    take away blessings. No person commits a sin but one of the blessings of \r\n    Allaah is taken away because of that sin. If he repents, then it is \r\n    restored, but if he persists in it, it is not given back to him, and the \r\n    sins continue to take away blessings until the blessings disappear \r\n    altogether. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, Allaah will not \r\n    change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their \r\n    state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful \r\n    and disobedient to Allaah)&rdquo; [???]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Ra&rsquo;d 13:11]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The greatest of blessings \r\n    is faith, but the sins of zina, stealing, drinking alcohol and robbery take \r\n    them away and cause them to disappear. One of the salaf said:&nbsp; I committed a \r\n    sin and I was deprived of praying qiyaam for a year. Another said: I \r\n    committed a sin and I was deprived of understanding of the Qur&rsquo;aan. \r\n    Concerning such things it was said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you have been blessed \r\n    then take care of it, for sin takes away blessings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up: Sin is a fire \r\n    that consumes blessings, just as fire consumes wood, Allaah forbid that His \r\n    blessings be lost.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Fear of Allaah and of \r\n    His punishment. This may be established by believing in His promises and \r\n    warnings, and by believing in Him, His Books and His Messengers. This is \r\n    strengthened by means of knowledge and certain faith, and it is weakened if \r\n    those two things are weakened, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;It is only those who \r\n    have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[Faatir 35:28]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of the salaf said: Fear \r\n    of Allaah is a sign of knowledge and taking Allaah&rsquo;s forgiveness for granted \r\n    is a sign of ignorance. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; Love of Allaah. This is \r\n    the strongest factor in being patient in refraining from disobeying Him. The \r\n    one who loves will be obedient to the one whom he loves. The stronger that \r\n    love grows in his heart, the more his willingness to obey Him and his \r\n    unwillingness to disobey Him will grow. Sin and disobedience stem from \r\n    weakness of love. There is a difference between one who is motivated to \r\n    avoid disobeying his master because of his fear of his whip and punishment, \r\n    and one who is motivated to avoid that because of his love for his master.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; Nobility and purity of \r\n    heart. If a person has self-respect and is keen to attain virtue, he will \r\n    refrain from anything that may lead to doom and dishonour.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; Certain knowledge of \r\n    the consequences of disobedience and the harm that may&nbsp; result from it, such \r\n    as blackening of the face, darkness in the heart, distress, grief, pain, \r\n    depression, anxiety, lack of focus, weakness in the face of one&rsquo;s enemy, \r\n    confusion, sense of abandonment, being overpowered by one&rsquo;s enemy, failing \r\n    to benefit from knowledge, forgetting what one has already learned, and \r\n    sickness that will surely lead to death if it takes hold, because sins \r\n    deaden the heart. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up: the awful \r\n    effects of sin are too many for a person to grasp, and the good effects of \r\n    obedience are too many for a person to grasp. The best of this world and the \r\n    Hereafter may be attained by obeying Allaah, and the worst of this world and \r\n    the Hereafter comes from disobeying Him. Concerning some of these effects \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;Who could ever obey Me and be \r\n    doomed because of it and who could ever disobey Me and attain blessings \r\n    because of it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>8 &ndash; Lack of worldly hope \r\n    and certainty that he will soon depart this world, and the realization that \r\n    he is like a traveller who enters a town determined to leave it, or like a \r\n    rider who rests in the shade of a tree then moves on and leaves it. Because \r\n    he knows how short his stay will be and how quickly he will move on, he is \r\n    keen to leave behind anything that may weigh him down or cause him harm and \r\n    bring no benefit.&nbsp; He is keen to move on with the best that he has. A person \r\n    has nothing better than a lack of worldly ambition and nothing more harmful \r\n    than procrastinating and focusing on worldly ambitions. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>9 &ndash; Avoiding excess in his \r\n    food, drink, clothing, sleeping, and meeting people, because the temptation \r\n    to commit sin grows stronger if there is any excess in these areas, because \r\n    that requires an outlet and what is permissible becomes no longer enough and \r\n    one begins to transgress into haraam areas. One of the most harmful things \r\n    for a person is idleness and free time, because the soul is never idle; if \r\n    it is not kept busy with beneficial things it will inevitably occupy itself \r\n    with harmful things. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>10 &ndash; This sums up all the \r\n    previous things: it is faith that is firmly-rooted in the heart. Patience in \r\n    refraining from sin depends on strength of faith. The stronger a person&rsquo;s \r\n    faith is, the more patient he will be, but if his faith is weak his patience \r\n    will be weak too. If a person&rsquo;s heart is filled with the belief that Allaah \r\n    is watching him and can see him, and has forbidden what He has forbidden to \r\n    him and will be angry with the one who does it and punish him, and if his \r\n    heart is filled with the belief in the reward and punishment, Paradise and \r\n    Hell, then he will not fail to act upon this knowledge. Whoever thinks that \r\n    he can give up sin without firm and deeply-rooted faith is mistaken. If the \r\n    lamp of faith is strong in the heart it will illuminate all of its corners \r\n    and shine its light into its depths; that light will then spread throughout \r\n    his body and he will respond quickly to the promptings of faith, and will \r\n    obey humbly and willingly, with no resentment. Rather he will rejoice in \r\n    this call when it comes, just as a man rejoices in the call of his beloved \r\n    who calls him to show him kindness and honour him, so he is waiting for his \r\n    call all the time. Allaah bestows His mercy upon whomsoever He will ...

We will discuss its meaning \r\n    according to the scholars below.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obligatory for the fasting person to refrain from \r\n    things which break the fast from the true dawn until the sun sets.&nbsp; What is \r\n    means is when dawn breaks, not the adhaan. Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn \r\n    appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:187]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>\r\n    So when a person becomes certain that the true dawn has come, \r\n    he has to stop eating and drinking, and if there is food in his mouth he has \r\n    to spit it out; if he does not do that, then he has invalidated his fast.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if a person is not certain that dawn has come, he may eat \r\n    until he is certain. The same applies if he knows that the muezzin gives the \r\n    call before the time comes, or if he is not sure whether he gives the call \r\n    on time or ahead of time: he may eat until he is certain. But it is better \r\n    for him to stop eating as soon as he hears the adhaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the hadeeth mentioned above, the scholars \r\n    interpreted it as referring to a muezzin who gives the call to prayer before \r\n    dawn breaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> 6\/333:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have stated that if dawn breaks and a person has food in \r\n    his mouth, he should spit it out and complete his fast. If he swallows it \r\n    after knowing that dawn has come, his fast is invalidated. There is no \r\n    difference of scholarly opinion on this point. The evidence for that is the \r\n    hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with them both), \r\n    according to which that Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Bilaal gives the call to prayer at night, so eat \r\n    and drink until Ibn Umm Maktoom gives the call to prayer.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari and Muslim. There are many ahaadeeth in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> with \r\n    similar meanings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him), according which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If one of you hears the call (to prayer) and the \r\n    vessel is still in his hand, let him not put it down until he has finished \r\n    with it&rdquo; &ndash; and according to another version he said: the muezzin used to \r\n    give the call to prayer when dawn broke &ndash; al-Haakim Abu &lsquo;Abd-Allaah narrated \r\n    the first version, and said: This is saheeh according to the conditions of \r\n    Muslim. Both were narrated by al-Bayhaqi, who said: If this is saheeh, it is \r\n    understood by the majority of scholars as meaning that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew that he used to give the \r\n    call to prayer before dawn came, thus the eating and drinking referred to \r\n    were taking place just before dawn came. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The phrase &ldquo;when dawn broke&rdquo; is understood to be the words of \r\n    someone other than Abu Hurayrah, or it may be describing the second adhaan, \r\n    in which case the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) &ndash; &ldquo;If one of you hears the call (to prayer) and the vessel is \r\n    still in his hand&rdquo; &ndash; refer to the first call to prayer, so that it is in \r\n    accordance with the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with them).

This cannot be regarded as certainty \r\n    that dawn has come.

If it is given after dawn breaks, then one must stop \r\n    eating as soon as he hears the call, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Bilaal gives the call to prayer at \r\n    night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktoom gives the call to prayer, for \r\n    he does not give the call until dawn has broken.&rdquo; If you know that this \r\n    muezzin does not give the call to prayer until dawn has broken, then stop as \r\n    soon as you hear him. But if the muezzin gives the call based on a timetable \r\n    he follows, or based on his watch, then the matter is less serious.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, we say to this questioner: You do not have to \r\n    make up what is past, because you were not certain whether you ate after \r\n    dawn had broken. But in the future you should be careful; when you hear the \r\n    muezzin, stop eating.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Ramadaan<\/i>, p. 204&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Shaykh said, pointing out what is said about \r\n    timetables being inaccurate:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because some people nowadays are uncertain about the \r\n    timetables that people have, and they say that they give the time of dawn \r\n    too early, we went out into the desert with no lights around us, and we saw \r\n    that the dawn came later, and some people exaggerated and suggested that the \r\n    dawn comes twenty minutes later. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it seems that this exaggeration is not correct. What we \r\n    think is that the timetables that people have nowadays give the time of dawn \r\n    in particular as five minutes early, so if you eat whilst the muezzin is \r\n    giving the adhaan according to the timetable, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Some \r\n    muezzins, may Allaah reward them with good, give the adhaan five minutes \r\n    later than the time given in the timetables as they exist at present, as a \r\n    precaution, but some ignorant muezzins give the adhaan for Fajr early, \r\n    claiming that this is on the safe side with regard to the fast, but they \r\n    forget that they are being careless with regard to something that is more \r\n    important than the fast, namely Fajr prayer.

One of the first duties of a husband towards his wife is \r\n    to teach her about her religion and &lsquo;aqeedah (beliefs) as Allaah has \r\n    enjoined. Undoubtedly your husband&rsquo;s telling you that what he is doing is \r\n    what Islam teaches is not correct. This is a kind of speaking about Allaah \r\n    without knowledge, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him), even though he had his companions and was concerned about \r\n    their affairs and meeting their needs, was nevertheless at his family&rsquo;s \r\n    service and took care of them. It was narrated that Aswad said: I asked \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    used to do in his house. She said: &ldquo;He used to be at his family&rsquo;s service \r\n    and when the time for prayer came, he would go out and attend the prayer.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 644. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and live with them honourably&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:19]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This indicates that kind \r\n    and honourable treatment is the basis of married life as enjoined by \r\n    Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is well known that breaking the fast with one's wife, even \r\n    if that is only on some days, is a kind of treating her kindly, especially \r\n    at the beginning of marriage, when sharee&rsquo;ah calls for everything that will \r\n    help to strengthen the marriage, especially if the wife feels lonely. It is \r\n    also an opportunity to teach her in a practical manner some of the Sunnahs \r\n    and etiquette of breaking the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, we suggest that the husband should take \r\n    care of his home and family, and look after them, and not fall short in his \r\n    duties towards them. He should understand that he will be rewarded for \r\n    taking care of his family&rsquo;s affairs, more than taking care of others who are \r\n    not members of his family. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Charity given to a poor person is charity, but \r\n    charity given to a relative is two things: charity and upholding the ties of \r\n    kinship.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, no. 2528; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Begin with those who \r\n    are your dependents.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1360; Muslim, 1034. This does \r\n    not mean that he is Islamically obliged to break the fast with his wife \r\n    every day, but undoubtedly it is an act of kindness towards his wife and \r\n    family to keep them company and reduce their loneliness, and to be with they \r\n    when they need him in some of their affairs, especially since the questioner \r\n    says that she is tired because of pregnancy. It is also an act of kindness \r\n    towards one&rsquo;s wife and family to be gentle and kind to them, to keep them \r\n    company and to look after them. It is not an act of kindness to do as some \r\n    men do, spending the evenings in the company of their friends and not caring \r\n    about their families or wives.

It is better to go at the beginning of Ramadaan so as to avoid the crowds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>15 &ndash; The husband should not overburden his wife with more than \r\n    she can bear of having to prepare food and sweets. Many people take this month to prepare fancy foods and drinks, and they go extremes in that. \r\n    This detracts from the sweetness of this month and goes against the reason for fasting, which is to attain piety.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>16 &ndash; The month of Ramadaan is the month of the Qur&rsquo;aan, so we \r\n    suggest that each family gets together to read Qur&rsquo;aan. The father should teach his family to recite Qur&rsquo;aan and help them to understand the \r\n    meanings of the verses. In the same gathering they may also read a book about the rulings and etiquette of fasting. Allaah has enabled many \r\n    scholars and seekers of knowledge to write books which can be used for preaching and teaching during Ramadaan; the books are divided into thirty \r\n    parts, so one topic can be read each day, and this will benefit everyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>17 &ndash; They should be encouraged to spend and check on their \r\n    neighbours and the needy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous during Ramadaan when Jibreel met \r\n    him. He would meet him each night and revise the Qur&rsquo;aan with him. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \r\n    more generous than the blowing wind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6; Muslim, 2308.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>18 &ndash; The parents should prevent their families and children from \r\n    staying up late at night and wasting their time in things that are of no benefit, let alone things that are haraam. For the devils among mankind \r\n    are more active in this month in promoting evil things and acts of immorality to those who are fasting, during the nights of Ramadaan and during \r\n    the days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>19 &ndash; They should remember the family&rsquo;s meeting in Allaah&rsquo;s Paradise in the Hereafter, and the great joy of meeting there under the shade of His throne.

If it is done because of \r\n      an excuse such as travelling -- which means a journey of approximately 70 \r\n      or 80 km, which is the distance that could be covered in one night on \r\n      mounts and on foot, which is what is called travelling -- there is nothing \r\n      wrong with breaking the fast in this case. But if one is at home or on the \r\n      outskirts of the city, that is not called travelling and breaking the fast \r\n      in this case is a major sin. The one who helps the person to break his \r\n      fast shares with him in the sin, because Allah, may He be glorified, says \r\n      (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Help you one another in Al&#8209;Birr and At&#8209;Taqwa (virtue, \r\n    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \r\n    transgression&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:2].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who helps a person who breaks the fast in Ramadan \r\n    without an excuse, by offering him food or coffee or tea or any other food \r\n    or drink is a sinner who is a partner in sin with the one who breaks the \r\n    fast, but his fast is still valid and is not invalidated by his helping that \r\n    person. But he is a sinner and he has to repent to Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As you forced your daughter or your son's wife to make the \r\n    food, you have to repent to Allah. You did wrong by telling her to make food \r\n    for him. She did right by not obeying him, because there is no obedience to \r\n    a created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Obedience is only in that \r\n    which is right and proper.&rdquo; If her husband ordered her to bring him food \r\n    during the day in Ramadan, without any excuse that would make it permissible \r\n    for him to break the fast, such as sickness or travelling, she has no right \r\n    to help him to do that which Allah has forbidden, even if he gets angry or \r\n    divorces her, because obedience to Allah takes precedence over obedience to \r\n    one's husband or father or ruler, because the Messenger (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Obedience is only in that which is right and \r\n    proper&rdquo;; he also said: &ldquo;There is no obedience to any created being if it \r\n    involves disobedience towards Allah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This man is not regarded as a traveller because he stayed \r\n    with them for a week and it seems that he had decided to stay for more than \r\n    four days. This means that he was obliged to fast according to the correct \r\n    scholarly view, which is the view of the majority of scholars. As they had \r\n    decided to stay for more than four days with their in-laws, they should have \r\n    fasted with them. If the stay is four days or less, they are not obliged to \r\n    fast because they are travellers, but if they do fast, there is nothing \r\n    wrong with that. But as they intended to stay with them for more than four \r\n    days, what they should have done in this case is fast, so as to avoid an \r\n    area of scholarly disagreement and so as to follow the view of the majority, \r\n    because the basic principle is that one should fast in Ramadan, and there is \r\n    some doubt as to whether it was permissible to break the fast.

Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1926) and Muslim (1109). \r\n    According to Muslim, it says: &ldquo;not as the result of an erotic dream&rdquo;. If \r\n    that is the case with regard to intercourse, then it applies also to a wet \r\n    dream and is more appropriate, because intercourse happens by the \r\n    individual&rsquo;s choice, whereas he has no choice with regard to a wet dream \r\n    (i.e., it occurs involuntarily).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars unanimously agreed that the fast of one who is \r\n    junub because of a wet dream is valid. Al-Maawardi said: The ummah is \r\n    unanimously agreed that if a person has a wet dream at night and he is able \r\n    to do ghusl before dawn, but he does not do ghusl and he starts the morning \r\n    junub as a result of a wet dream, or he has a wet dream during the day, his \r\n    fast is still valid.

Purification from impurity is one of the \r\n    conditions of prayer being valid according to scholarly consensus, as was \r\n    narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir in al-Ijmaa&lsquo; (1) and an-Nawawi in <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i> \r\n    (3\/102).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you should have done was ask knowledgeable people so \r\n    that you would not fall into such an error. The ways of asking questions \r\n    have become easier nowadays, praise be to Allah, and finding out Islamic \r\n    rulings has become a simple matter that is not difficult for anyone. If you \r\n    fell short in finding out about the ruling on the matter, then you have to \r\n    repent to Allah and ask for forgiveness for your sin. If you did not fall \r\n    short, then Allah will excuse you for your ignorance, by His grace and \r\n    kindness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But there was a difference of opinion among the scholars as \r\n    to whether you have to make up those prayers that you offered without \r\n    purification, or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most correct view is that this comes under the heading of \r\n    cases in which one may be excused for ignorance or mistakes, because the \r\n    person in question was confused on the basis that he was not able to do \r\n    gusl, so he thought that he did not have to do ghusl, and he did not know \r\n    that tayammum is an alternative to ghusl in the case of janaabah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view was supported by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, who \r\n    said in <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (23\/37): With regard to the one who did \r\n    not know that (some action having to do with the prayer) was obligatory, \r\n    then as soon as he finds out he should offer the prayer that is due at that \r\n    time and subsequent prayers (with that obligatory action), but he does not \r\n    have to repeat any of his previous prayers. It is proven in <i>as-Saheehayn<\/i> \r\n    that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to the \r\n    Bedouin who prayed badly: &ldquo;Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.&rdquo; He \r\n    said: By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than \r\n    this. Teach me that which will suffice me in my prayer. So he (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) taught him, and he instructed him to repeat the \r\n    prayer that was due at that time, but he did not instruct him to repeat \r\n    prayers that he had offered in the past, even though the man said: I cannot \r\n    do better than this. By the same token, he did not instruct &lsquo;Umar and \r\n    &lsquo;Ammaar to repeat the prayer; when &lsquo;Umar became junub he did not pray, and \r\n    &lsquo;Ammaar rolled in the dust like animals do. And he did not instruct Abu \r\n    Dharr to do the prayers that he has missed when he was in a state of \r\n    janaabah. And he did not instruct the woman who was suffering from irregular \r\n    non-menstrual bleeding (istihaadah) to make up the prayers that she had not \r\n    done, even though she said: I bleed very heavily and it prevents me from \r\n    fasting and praying. And he did not instruct those who ate during Ramadan \r\n    until the white string became distinct from the black string to repeat the \r\n    fast. When the prayer was first enjoined, it was two (rak&lsquo;ahs) by two, then \r\n    when Zayd migrated, the prayer when not travelling was made four rak&lsquo;ahs. In \r\n    Makkah, Abyssinia and the deserts there were many Muslims who did not know \r\n    about that until after some time had passed, and they continued to pray two \r\n    rak&lsquo;ahs, but he did not instruct them to repeat the prayers that they had \r\n    offered. Similarly, he did not instruct those who had been praying towards \r\n    the abrogated qiblah (Jerusalem) to repeat the prayers they had offered \r\n    facing that direction before news of the abrogation had reached them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he said: A number of the senior Sahaabah used not to do \r\n    ghusl after being intimate with their wives if no ejaculation occurred, \r\n    because they thought that water (ghusl) was for water (emission of semen), \r\n    until it was proven to them that that ruling had been abrogated. For some of \r\n    them, it was not proven to them that it was abrogated, and they continued to \r\n    pray without the purification that is required according to Islam, because \r\n    they did not know that it was obligatory, and one of them would pray when he \r\n    was in a state of janaabah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked \r\n    about a man who did wudoo&rsquo; and prayed Fajr when he was in a state of \r\n    janaabah, because he was afraid that he would miss the prayer in \r\n    congregation. He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that if he did that out of ignorance, \r\n    then he is to be excused for that, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) excused the one who prayed badly and did not instruct him \r\n    to make up past prayers; and he excused the woman who was suffering from \r\n    irregular non-menstrual bleeding (<i>istihaadah<\/i>) who did not pray; and \r\n    he excused &lsquo;Ammaar ibn Yaasir when he rolled in the dust, thinking that this \r\n    was what was required of him for tayammum.

This view was narrated from Imam Ahmad, and it is the view of \r\n    the Shaafa&rsquo;is. [See <i>Sharh al-Mushayqih &lsquo;ala Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, \r\n    4\/282-285.] But you sinned by telling her to break the fast, and she also \r\n    sinned if she obeyed you. If she did not fast so that you could have \r\n    intercourse with her, then she has to make up that day, and she alone has to \r\n    offer the severe expiation because of the intercourse that took place. This \r\n    has already been discussed in questions no.\r\n    [fatin]38023[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]22938[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]1672[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man \r\n    who wanted to have intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan, and \r\n    he broke his fast with food before having intercourse, then he had \r\n    intercourse. Does he have to offer expiation or not? What about the one who \r\n    breaks the fast with no excuse?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: \r\n    Praise be to Allaah. There are two well-known scholarly views concerning \r\n    this matter. The first is that it is obligatory. This is the view of the \r\n    majority, such as Maalik, Ahmad, Abu Haneefah and others. The second view is \r\n    that it is not obligatory. This is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i&hellip; Then they \r\n    disputed as to whether it is essential that he have broken a valid fast (in \r\n    order for the severe expiation to be required). Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and others said \r\n    that that is essential, for example if he eats and then has intercourse, or \r\n    he starts the day intending not to fast and then has intercourse, or he has \r\n    intercourse, then offers expiation, then has intercourse again. He does not \r\n    have to offer expiation, according to al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because he did not have \r\n    intercourse during a valid fast. But Ahmad and others say that he does have \r\n    to offer expiation in these and similar cases, because he should have \r\n    refrained from eating etc during Ramadaan, so this is an invalid fast. This \r\n    is like invalid ihraam. If a pilgrim who has entered ihraam for Hajj spoils \r\n    his ihraam, he has to continue refraining from the things that are forbidden \r\n    during ihraam, like those whose ihraam is still valid. Similarly, if a \r\n    person is obliged to fast during Ramadaan, he has to refrain even if his \r\n    fast is spoiled by eating or having intercourse, or by not having the \r\n    intention to fast. He should still refrain from doing the things that are \r\n    forbidden when fasting. But if he does not refrain, he is still subject to \r\n    the same requirement of expiation as if his fast was still valid. And in \r\n    either case he has to make up the fast as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>And Allaah \r\n    knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    Al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 2\/471; <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, \r\n    25\/260; see also al-Majmoo&rsquo;, 6\/321.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6945","question_id":"6945","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>You committed a sin by engaging in foreplay with your wife until you ejaculated, \r\n    because by doing so you invalidated your fast and violated the sanctity of this blessed month, and you missed out on the reward of fasting, \r\n    concerning which Allaah says: &ldquo;He gives up his desire and his food for My sake.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1761).<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Your regret for the action that you did is repentance.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr said in <i>al-Istidhkaar<\/i> (3\/296):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I do not know of any scholar who granted a concession with \r\n    regard to kissing for the one who is fasting, unless he is confident that \r\n    nothing will result from that; for the one who knows that it will result in \r\n    something that will invalidate his fast, he must avoid that. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in <i>Fataawa al-Siyaam<\/i> (p. \r\n    237): It is not permissible for a man to engage in foreplay with his wife if \r\n    he knows that he will ejaculate as a result of that, because some people are \r\n    quick to ejaculate just by engaging in foreplay, or kissing a woman and so \r\n    on. So we say to such a man: it is not permissible for you to engage in \r\n    foreplay with your wife so long as you fear that you may ejaculate. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (6\/234-235):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he seeks to expel semen by any means, whether by hand or \r\n    by rubbing it on the ground and so on until he ejaculates, then his fast is \r\n    invalidated by that. This is the view of the four imams (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on them), Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Abu Haneefah and Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The literalists (al-zaahiriyyah) rejected that and said: the \r\n    fast is not invalidated by masturbation even if one ejaculates, because \r\n    there is no evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah that the fast is invalidated \r\n    thereby, and an act of worship cannot be ruled to be invalidated unless \r\n    there is evidence from Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him). But in my view &ndash; and Allaah knows best &ndash; we may \r\n    understand that it does break the fast on the basis of the following two \r\n    points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; From the texts. In the saheeh hadeeth it states that \r\n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says concerning the one who fasts: \r\n    &ldquo;He gives up his food, his drink and his desire for My sake,&rdquo; and \r\n    masturbation is a kind of desire, and emission of semen is a kind of desire. \r\n    The evidence that semen may be described as desire is the words of the \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;In the intimacy \r\n    of one of you there is charity.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, if one \r\n    of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Do you not see \r\n    that if he fulfils it in a haraam manner, he will bear a burden of sin? \r\n    Similarly, if he fulfils it in a halaal manner, he will have reward.&rdquo; And \r\n    what is referred to here is semen. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Based on analogy. We say that the Sunnah states that a \r\n    person breaks his fast by making himself vomit if he vomits, and he breaks \r\n    his fast by cupping if he is treated with cupping and blood comes out of \r\n    him. Both of these weaken the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the emission of food, it is clear that this weakens \r\n    the body, because the stomach remains empty and the person will quickly \r\n    become hungry and thirsty.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the emission of blood, it also seems that it \r\n    weakens the body, and the same results from emission of semen, which \r\n    undoubtedly exhausts the body. Hence there is the command to do ghusl, which \r\n    restores energy to the body, and this is by analogy with cupping and \r\n    vomiting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this we say: if semen is emitted with desire, then \r\n    it invalidates the fast, on the basis of the texts and analogy. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on these two points &ndash; the fact that it is fulfilment of \r\n    desire and that it weakens the body, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) ruled that masturbation invalidates the fast. See\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 25\/251.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Masturbation during the day in Ramadaan invalidates the fast \r\n    if it is done deliberately and semen is emitted as a result. The person has \r\n    to make up that fast as an obligation, and he has to repent to Allaah, may \r\n    He be glorified and exalted, because masturbation, which is what people call \r\n    the &lsquo;secret habit&rsquo;, is not permissible whether one is fasting or otherwise. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    15\/267&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas \r\n    (10\/256) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Masturbation during Ramadaan and at other times is haraam and \r\n    it is not permissible to do it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, \r\n    from illegal sexual acts)<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>6.&nbsp;Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their \r\n    right hands possess, __for then, they are free from blame;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>7.&nbsp;But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the \r\n    transgressors&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Mu&rsquo;minoon 23:5]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who does that during the day in Ramadaan when he is \r\n    fasting has to repent to Allaah and make up the fast of the day when he did \r\n    that, but he does not have to offer expiation (kafaarah), because expiation \r\n    is required only in the case of intercourse.

The same applies to the \r\n    woman if she was willing, but if she was forced then she does not have to do \r\n    anything. If they were traveling then there is no sin on them and they do \r\n    not have to offer any expiation, and they do not have to refrain from eating \r\n    for the rest of the day, but they do have to make up that day, because \r\n    fasting is not obligatory for them (as they are traveling).

It makes no \r\n    difference whether there was any ejaculation or not, so long as intercourse \r\n    has taken place. This is unlike the case when ejaculation takes place \r\n    without intercourse, for which no expiation is due, rather this is a sin, \r\n    and the person must refrain from eating etc for the rest of the day, and \r\n    make the day up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He was also asked about a man who forces his wife to have \r\n    intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, and replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is haraam for her to obey her husband or to allow him to \r\n    do that in this case, because she is observing an obligatory fast.

Ignorance of the punishment is no \r\n    excuse, but ignorance of the ruling is an excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence the scholars said: If a person drinks \r\n    an intoxicant thinking that it will not cause intoxication, or thinking that it is not haraam, then there is no sin on him. But if he knows that \r\n    it will cause intoxication and that it is haraam, but he does not know that he is to be punished for that, then he should be punished and he is \r\n    not excused from that. Based on this, we say to the questioner that so long as you did not know that intercourse without ejaculation was haraam, \r\n    there is no sin on you or on your wife, if she was also ignorant of the ruling as you were.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The effect of this action on fasting and \r\n    prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to fasting, janaabah (being in a \r\n    state of impurity following sexual activity) does not have any effect on it, because the fasting of a person who is in a state of janaabah is \r\n    valid. But not doing ghusl in order to pray poses a problem, because prayer is not valid without doing ghusl because the person remains in a state \r\n    of janaabah. Most of the scholars are of the view that this person must make up all the prayers for which he did not do ghusl, but is it known \r\n    that this man will have had intercourse and ejaculated, and then done ghusl.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But he may not know how often he did that. So \r\n    we say to him that he should try to work it out and do his best to make up the prayers, to be on the safe side. But if you did not know anything \r\n    about this and it did not cross your mind that simply having intercourse without ejaculating would mean that ghusl was essential, then we hope \r\n    that you do not have to do anything, i.e., that you do not have to make up the prayers.

The evidence that this is mustahabb is the fact that Jibreel used to meet the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan and study the Qur&rsquo;aan with him.

As for young children who \r\n    have not yet reached the age of puberty, fasting is not obligatory for them, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;The pen has been lifted from three&rdquo; and he mentioned young children until \r\n    they reach puberty. But the child&rsquo;s guardian must tell him to fast if he \r\n    reaches an age where he is able to do so, because that comes under the \r\n    heading of training him to implement the pillars of Islam. We see some \r\n    people leaving their children alone and not telling them to pray or fast, \r\n    but this is wrong, and he (the parent) will be responsible for that before \r\n    Allaah. They say that they do not make their children fast out of kindness \r\n    and compassion towards them, but in fact the one who is truly kind and \r\n    compassionate towards his child is the one who trains him to acquire good \r\n    characteristics and to do righteous deeds, not the one who refrains from \r\n    disciplining and training him in a beneficial manner.

The multiplication of hasanaat is in \r\n    both quantity and quality. What is meant by quantity is number, so a good deed is multiplied by ten times the like thereof; and what is meant by \r\n    quality is that the reward is great and vast. With regard to sayi&rsquo;aat, it is multiplied in terms of quality only, i.e., the sin is greater and the \r\n    punishment is more severe. With regard to quantity a bad deed receives one sayi&rsquo;ah, and it cannot be more than one.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It says in <i>Mataalib Uli al-Nuha<\/i> (2\/385):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Hasanaat and sayi&rsquo;aat are multiplied in a special place such as Makkah, Madeenah \r\n    and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and in the mosques; and at special times such as on Fridays, during the sacred months and in Ramadaan. With regard \r\n    to the multiplication of hasanaat, this is a matter concerning which there is no scholarly difference of opinion. With regard to the \r\n    multiplication of sayi&rsquo;aat, this was the view of a number of scholars, following Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood&hellip; Some scholars said that what Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood meant by the view on the multiplication of sayi&rsquo;aat is that they are multiplied in quality but not in quantity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;Does fasting bring the \r\n    Muslim expiation for both minor and major sins? Is the sin of an evil action compounded in Ramadaan?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He replied: &ldquo;What is prescribed for the Muslim in Ramadaan and at other times is \r\n    to strive against his nafs (self) that is inclined towards evil until it becomes tranquil and inclined towards goodness. He must fight against the \r\n    enemy of Allaah Iblees until he is safe from his evil and his whispers. The Muslim in this world is engaged in a great, ongoing struggle against \r\n    his nafs, his desires and the Shaytaan. So he has to repent a great deal and pray for forgiveness at all times. But times vary one from another. \r\n    The month of Ramadaan is the best month of the year, for it is the month of forgiveness, mercy and ransom from the Fire. If the month is special \r\n    and the place is special, the hasanaat for good deeds are multiplied and the sayi&rsquo;aat for sins are multiplied. An evil deed done in Ramadaan is \r\n    more sinful than one done at any other time, just as an act of worship done in Ramadaan brings a greater reward from Allaah than one done at any \r\n    other time. Because Ramadaan has such a great status, an act of worship done during this month is especially virtuous and its reward is greatly \r\n    multiplied, and a sin committed during this month is worse and more serious than a sin committed at any other time. So the Muslim has to make the \r\n    most of this blessed month by doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, and giving up bad deeds, so that Allaah may bless him by accepting his \r\n    good deeds and helping to remain steadfast in adhering to the truth. But a bad deed receives one sayi&rsquo;ah like it, and is not multiplied in terms \r\n    of quantity either in Ramadaan or at other times. But a good deed may be multiplied ten or more times, because Allaah says in Soorat al-An&rsquo;aam \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Whoever brings a good deed (Islamic Monotheism and deeds of obedience to Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger) shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed (polytheism, disbelief, hypocrisy, and deeds of \r\n    disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger) shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-An&rsquo;aam 6:160]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And there are many similar verses.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly in special places such as the Haramayn [the Two Sanctuaries, i.e., in \r\n    Makkah and Madeenah] deeds are multiplied greatly in quantity and quality; bad deeds are not multiplied in quantity but they are multiplied in \r\n    quality when done at special times or in special places, as referred to above.

Hence you will find the Muslims reading the entire Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    during Ramadaan, and some of them read the entire Book once or twice, or \r\n    more than that. The Muslim knows that reading a single letter of the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    brings a tenfold reward, and that reading a single page brings a thousand \r\n    rewards (hasanaat).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Charity and feeding the poor&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous in \r\n    Ramadaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    encouraged us to feed the poor and to give fasting people food to break \r\n    their fast.

This is called Zakaat al-Fitr, by means of which the \r\n    fasting person offers expiation for any idle or obscene speech he may have \r\n    uttered during his fast; it is also a means of feeding and helping the \r\n    poor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obligatory upon every Muslim, young and old, male and \r\n    female. It is one of the ways of making people feel the unity, cohesion and \r\n    mutual compassion of the Muslim community.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; Allaah has also enjoined that those who have fasted \r\n    should offer the Eid prayer, as a conclusion to these good deeds that they \r\n    have done during Ramadaan, and as a way of bringing them together to express \r\n    their joy and gratitude towards Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that the Muslim spends the month of Ramadaan in \r\n    fasting, praying, offering night prayers (Taraweeh), remembering Allaah and \r\n    reading Qur&rsquo;aan, and has ended it with i&rsquo;tikaaf and charity, as well as \r\n    striving to uphold the ties of kinship and do good deeds, and spending a \r\n    great deal for the sake of Allaah, and other righteous good deeds. Ramadaan \r\n    is an occasion that is good for him, in which he does acts of worship and \r\n    rids himself of the burdens of sin.

Will they only choose to do that which suits them, or will \r\n    they do that which pleases Allaah? If we think about the five acts of \r\n    worship: testimony of faith, prayer, zakaah, fasting and pilgrimage, we will \r\n    see that some of them are purely physical, some are purely financial, some \r\n    are both, so that the miser will become distinct from the generous. For some \r\n    people it may be easy for them to pray one thousand rak&rsquo;ahs but not to give \r\n    a single dirham; for others it may be easy to give a thousand dirhams but \r\n    not to pray a single rak&rsquo;ahs. So Islam came to prescribe a variety of acts \r\n    of worship so as to determine who will follow in obedience to the command of \r\n    Allaah and who will follow only that which suits him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Prayer, for example, is a purely physical action, but its \r\n    prerequisites require some expenditure, such as the water for wudoo&rsquo;, and \r\n    clothes to cover the &lsquo;awrah. These are not part of the prayer but they are \r\n    its prerequisites.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Zakaah is purely financial, but physical actions are required \r\n    to fulfil this duty such as calculating one's wealth and transferring the \r\n    zakaah to the poor and needy. These are not part of zakaah but they are its \r\n    prerequisites.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hajj involves spending wealth and physical action, except for \r\n    the people of Makkah who may not need money, but the yare very few compared \r\n    with those who live in Makkah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Jihad for the sake of Allaah may require both money and \r\n    physical effort. A person may spend money for the sake of Allaah and not \r\n    fight, or he may go and fight but not spend money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Commands are of two types: commands to refrain from things \r\n    that man is inclined towards, and commands to spend that are precious.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Refraining from things that are loved includes fasting, and \r\n    expenditure of things that are loved includes zakaah. Wealth is something \r\n    that is loved and no one spends the wealth that he loves except for \r\n    something that is loved even more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to refraining from things that are loved, \r\n    for a person may like to spend a thousand dirhams, but not fast a single \r\n    day, or vice versa.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 6\/190.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is another great reason why fasting is prescribed, \r\n    which has been discussed in part in the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]26862[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked about the reason why fasting \r\n    was enjoined?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we read the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<b>&nbsp;<\/b>O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the \r\n    fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, \r\n    that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (pious)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:183]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    we will know the reason why fasting was prescribed, which is \r\n    taqwa (piety) and submission to Allaah. Taqwa means giving up haraam things, \r\n    and in general terms includes both doing what is commanded and abstaining \r\n    from what is forbidden. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it \r\n    and offensive speech and behaviour, Allaah has no need of his giving up his \r\n    food and drink.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6057. See also questions no.\r\n    [fatin]37658[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]37989[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on this, it is important for the one \r\n    who is fasting to carry out religious duties and avoid haraam things in word \r\n    and deed. So he should not backbite about people, tell lies, or spread \r\n    malicious gossip among them, or engage in haraam transactions, and he should \r\n    avoid all haraam things. If a person does that for a whole month, the rest \r\n    of the year will go well, but unfortunately in the case of many of those who \r\n    fast, there is no difference between a day when they fast and a day when \r\n    they do not; they behave as they usually do, neglecting obligatory duties \r\n    and doing forbidden things. You do not see the dignity that is to be \r\n    expected of the fasting person. These actions do not invalidate their fast \r\n    but they do detract from its reward and may cancel out the reward \r\n    altogether.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i>, p. 451.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6969","question_id":"6969","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&rsquo;aan, a guidance for mankind and clear \r\n    proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong).

Each of us should realize that whatever has befallen him could not have missed him, and whatever missed him could not have \r\n    befallen him, and that everything happens by the will and decree of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We should avoid everything that could \r\n    undermine our commitment to the Shahaadatayn. This means keeping away from bid&rsquo;ah (innovations) and things that have been introduced into the \r\n    religion. We should also follow the principle of al-walaa&rsquo; wa&rsquo;l-bara&rsquo; (loyalty and friendship vs. disavowal and enmity), by taking the believers \r\n    as our friends and by regarding the kaafirs and hypocrites as enemies, and we should rejoice when the Muslims gain a victory over their enemies. \r\n    We should follow the example of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions and adhere to the Sunnah of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khulafa&rsquo; who came after him. We should love the Sunnah \r\n    and love those who adhere to it and defend it, in whatever country they are and whatever colour or nationality they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After that we should take stock of ourselves \r\n    and recognize our shortcomings in doing acts of worship such as praying in congregation, remembering Allaah (dhikr), paying attention to the \r\n    rights of neighbours, relatives and the Muslims, spreading the greeting of salaam, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, urging one \r\n    another to follow the truth and be patient and steadfast in doing so, being patient in avoiding evil actions and in doing good deeds, and \r\n    accepting the decree of Allaah with patience.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then we should take stock of ourselves and \r\n    our sins and our following whims and desires. We should stop ourselves from persisting in that, whether the sin is great or small, whether it is a \r\n    sin of the eye, by looking at that which Allaah has forbidden; or by listening to music; or by walking to things of which Allaah does not approve; \r\n    or by using one's hands to srike in a manner with which Allaah is not pleased; or by consuming things that Allaah has forbidden such as riba \r\n    (usury) and bribes, or any other means of consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;We should never forget that Allaah stretches \r\n    forth His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who sinned at night, and He stretches forth His hand at night to accept the \r\n    repentance of those who sinned during the day.

Today there is action and no reckoning, but tomorrow there will be the reckoning and no action.

The word <i>Hakeem<\/i> is derived from the same root as <i>hukm<\/i> (ruling) and <i>hikmah<\/i> (wisdom). \r\n    Allaah alone is the One Who issues rulings, and His rulings are the most wise and perfect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah does not prescribe any ruling but \r\n    there is great wisdom behind it, which we may understand, or our minds may not be guided to understand it. We may know some of it but a great deal \r\n    is hidden from us.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah has mentioned the reason and wisdom \r\n    behind His enjoining of fasting upon us, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the \r\n    fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:183]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fasting is a means of attaining taqwa (piety, \r\n    being conscious of Allaah), and taqwa means doing that which Allaah has enjoined and avoiding that which He has forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fasting is one of the greatest means of \r\n    helping a person to fulfil the commands of Islam.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) \r\n    have mentioned some of the reasons why fasting is prescribed, all of which are characteristics of taqwa, but there is nothing wrong with quoting \r\n    them here, to draw the attention of fasting people to them and make them keen to attain them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Among the reasons behind fasting are:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Fasting is a means that makes us \r\n    appreciate and give thanks for pleasures. For fasting means giving up eating, drinking and intercourse, which are among the greatest pleasures. By \r\n    giving them up for a short time, we begin to appreciate their value. Because the blessings of Allaah are not recognized, but when you abstain from \r\n    them, you begin to recognize them, so this motivates you to be grateful for them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;2 &ndash; Fasting is a means of giving up haraam \r\n    things, because if a person can give up halaal things in order to please Allaah and for fear of His painful torment, then he will be more likely \r\n    to refrain from haraam things. So fasting is a means of avoiding the things that Allaah has forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Fasting enables us to control our \r\n    desires, because when a person is full his desires grow, but if he is hungry then his desire becomes weak. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in \r\n    lowering the gaze and protecting one&rsquo;s chastity. Whoever cannot do that, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Fasting makes us feel compassion and \r\n    empathy towards the poor, because when the fasting person tastes the pain of hunger for a while, he remembers those who are in this situation all \r\n    the time, so he will hasten to do acts of kindness to them and show compassion towards them. So fasting is a means of feeling empathy with the \r\n    poor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;5 &ndash; Fasting humiliates and weakens the \r\n    Shaytaan; it weakens the effects of his whispers (waswaas) on a person and reduces his sins. That is because the Shaytaan &ldquo;flows through the son \r\n    of Adam like blood&rdquo; as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, but fasting narrows the passages through which the \r\n    Shaytaan flows, so his influence grows less.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, \r\n    25\/246&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Undoubtedly blood is created from food and \r\n    drink, so when a person eats and drinks, the passages through which the devils flow &ndash; which is the blood &ndash; become wide. But if a person fasts, the \r\n    passages through which the devils flow become narrow, so hearts are motivated to do good deeds, and to give up evil deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; The fasting person is training himself to \r\n    remember that Allaah is always watching, so he gives up the things that he desires even though he is able to take them, because he knows that \r\n    Allaah can see him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; Fasting means developing an attitude of \r\n    asceticism towards this world and its desires, and seeking that which is with Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>8 &ndash; It makes the Muslim get used to doing a \r\n    great deal of acts of worship, because the fasting person usually does more acts of worship and gets used to that. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>These are some of the reasons why fasting is \r\n    enjoined.

It is better to delay suhoor until the latest possible time of the night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after that the Muslim gets ready for \r\n    Fajr prayer before the adhaan. So he does wudoo&rsquo; at home and goes out to the mosque before the adhaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When he enters the mosque, he prays two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs (tahiyyat al-masjid &ndash; greeting the mosque). Then he sits and keeps busy making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, or reading Qur&rsquo;aan, or reciting dhikr, until the \r\n    muezzin gives the call to prayer. He repeats what the muezzin says, and says the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) to be said after the adhaan ends. Then after that he prays two rak&rsquo;ahs (the regular Sunnah of Fajr), then he occupies himself \r\n    with du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and reading Qur&rsquo;aan until the iqaamah for prayer is given. He is in a state of prayer so long as he is waiting for the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After offering the prayer in congregation, he \r\n    recites the dhikrs that are prescribed following the salaam at the end of the prayer. After that if he wants to sit in the mosque until the sun \r\n    has risen, reciting dhikr and reading Qur&rsquo;aan, that is preferable, and that is what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    used to do after Fajr prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then about one-quarter of an hour after the \r\n    sun has risen, if he wants he can pray Duha prayer (a minimum of two rak&rsquo;ahs), and that is good. Or if he wants he can delay it until the \r\n    preferred time, which is when the day has grown hotter and the sun is higher in the sky &ndash; that is better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then if he wants he may sleep to prepare \r\n    himself for going to work, and he can intend by sleeping to strengthen himself for worship and earning a living, so that he will be rewarded for \r\n    it in sha Allah. He should also follow the etiquette of sleep that is prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah, both actions and words.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he goes to work, and when the time for \r\n    Zuhr prayer comes, he goes to the mosque early, before the adhaan or immediately after it, and he should get ready to pray beforehand. So he prays \r\n    four rak&rsquo;ahs with two tasleems (the regular Sunnah before Zuhr), then he keeps busy reading Qur&rsquo;aan until the iqaamah for prayer is given, and he \r\n    prays with the congregation, then he prays two rak&rsquo;ahs (the regular Sunnah after Zuhr).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after the prayer he goes and finishes \r\n    whatever of his work is left, until it is time to leave work. If there is a long time to go after finishing his work until the time for &lsquo;Asr \r\n    prayer, then he can rest. But if there is not enough time and he fears that if he sleeps he will miss &lsquo;Asr prayer, then he should keep busy doing \r\n    something suitable until the time for &lsquo;Asr comes, such as going to the market to buy some things that his family needs and the like, or going \r\n    straight to the mosque when he has finished his work, and staying in the mosque until he has prayed &lsquo;Asr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after &lsquo;As, it depends on his \r\n    circumstances. If he can stay in the mosque and keep busy reading Qur&rsquo;aan, this is a great opportunity. But if he feels tired, then he should rest \r\n    at this time so that he will be ready to pray taraaweeh at night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Before the adhaan for Maghrib, he should get \r\n    ready to break his fast, and he should do something at this time that will benefit him, whether reading Qur&rsquo;aan, making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, or having a useful \r\n    conversation with his wife and children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>One of the best things that he can do at this \r\n    time is to take part in offering iftaar to those who are fasting, whether by bringing food to them or helping to distribute it to them and \r\n    organizing that. This brings a great joy which no one knows except those who have experienced it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>After iftaar, he goes and prays in \r\n    congregation in the mosque, and after the prayer he prays two rak'ahs (the regular Sunnah of Maghrib). Then he goes back home and eats whatever is \r\n    available &ndash; without eating too much. Then he looks for a suitable way for himself and his family to spend this time, whether reading a book of \r\n    stories, or a book on practical rulings, or a quiz, or permissible conversation, or any other useful idea that is of interest to the members of \r\n    the family and will distracts them from the haraam things that appear in the media which regard this as their prime time, so you find the media \r\n    transmitting their most attractive programs at that time, that may contain immoral and obscene material. Strive to turn away from that, and fear \r\n    Allaah with regard to your &ldquo;flock&rdquo; (i.e., your family) concerning whom you will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection, so be prepared to answer \r\n    the questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then get ready for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer, go to the \r\n    mosque and keep busy reading Qur&rsquo;aan or listening to the lesson being given in the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after that perform &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer, then \r\n    pray two rak&rsquo;ahs (the regular Sunnah of &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;), then pray taraaweeh behind the imam with humility and focus, pondering the meanings of what is \r\n    recited. Do not finish until the imam finishes. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever stands (and prays) \r\n    with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded as if he spent the night in prayer.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1370, and others. Classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Salaat al-Taraaweeh<\/i>, p. 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after Taraaweeh you can make a program for yourself that is \r\n    suited to your circumstances and personal commitments. But you should pay attention to the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Keeping away from all haraam things and \r\n    whatever may lead to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Paying attention to ensuring that your family \r\n    avoid falling into any haraam thing or whatever may lead to that, in a wise manner, such as preparing a program just for them, or taking them out \r\n    for leisure trips to permissible places, or keeping them away from bad friends, or looking for good friends for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Keeping busy with things that take priority.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then you should try to sleep early, whilst \r\n    paying attention to the etiquette of sleep as prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah, both actions and words. If you read some Qur&rsquo;aan or some beneficial books \r\n    before going to sleep, that is something good, especially if you have not yet completed your daily portion of Qur&rsquo;aan &ndash; so do not go to sleep \r\n    until you have completed it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then wake up before suhoor, allowing enough \r\n    time to recite du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, because this time &ndash; the last third of the night &ndash; is the time when Allaah descends, and Allaah has praised those who seek \r\n    His forgiveness at this time, and has promised those who call upon Him at this time that He will answer them, and that He will accept the \r\n    repentance of those who repent to Him at this time. So do not neglect this great opportunity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Friday:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Friday is the best day of the week, so you \r\n    should have a special program of worship on this day, in which you pay attention to the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Coming early to Jumu&rsquo;ah prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Staying in the mosque after &lsquo;Asr prayer, and \r\n    keeping busy with reading Qur&rsquo;aan and making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; until the last hour of this day, for that is a time when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are answered.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Make this day an opportunity for completing \r\n    some of your deeds that you did not finish during the week, such as completing your weekly portion of Qur&rsquo;aan, or finishing reading a book or \r\n    listening to a tape and other good deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The last ten days of Ramadaan:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The last ten days of Ramadaan include Laylat \r\n    al-Qadr which is better than a thousand months. Hence it is prescribed for a person to observe i&rsquo;tikaaf (&ldquo;retreat&rdquo; for the purpose of worship) in \r\n    the mosque during these ten days, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do, seeking Laylat al-Qadr. Whoever can \r\n    observe i&rsquo;tikaaf at this time, this is a great blessing from Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whoever cannot observe i&rsquo;tikaaf for the \r\n    entire period should do as much as he is able to.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he is not able to do i&rsquo;tikaaf at all, then \r\n    he should try to spend the nights in worship. Praying qiyaam, reading Qur&rsquo;aan, remembering Allaah and making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. He should prepare for that by \r\n    resting during the day so that he will be able to stay up at night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Note:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This program is just a suggestion. It is a \r\n    flexible schedule that each person can adapt to his own circumstances.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This program pays attention to the Sunnahs \r\n    that are proven from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It does not mean that everything mentioned here is an \r\n    obligatory duty, rather it includes many things that are Sunnah and mustahabb.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The most beloved of actions to Allaah are \r\n    those which are continuous even if they are little. At the beginning of the month a person may be keen to do acts of worship, then he may slow \r\n    down.

For example, a person should try to \r\n    buy all the things that the family needs before the month begins, and he should buy day-to-day needs at times when the stores are not crowded, and \r\n    visits to friends and family should be organized in such a way that they do not distract from acts of worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Make doing lots of acts of worship and \r\n    drawing closer to Allaah your priority in this blessed month.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Resolve at the beginning of the month to go \r\n    to the mosque early at the times of prayer, and to complete the Book of Allaah, and to regularly pray qiyaam al-layl in this great month, and to \r\n    spend (in charity) what you can of your wealth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Make the most of the opportunity that the \r\n    month of Ramadaan brings to strengthen your connection to the Book of Allaah, by utilizing the following means:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Read the verses correctly.

If the kaafir is to be punished for the blessings of Allaah that he enjoyed, such as food, drink \r\n    and clothing, then it is more appropriate that he will be punished for doing haraam actions and not doing obligatory duties.

Everyone who has lost his mind, in whatever sense, is \r\n    not accountable and he is not obliged to do any of the obligatory duties of Islam, be it prayer, fasting or feeding the poor; he does not have to \r\n    do anything at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The third condition:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Being able to fast.

These people are allowed not to fast, then \r\n    they have to make up what they missed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Those who are permanently unable to fast, \r\n    such as one who is sick and has no hope of recovery, or those who are elderly and are unable to fast, are mentioned in the verse (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And as for those who can fast with \r\n    difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a<\/i> <i>Miskeen (poor \r\n    person) (for every day)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:184]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) interpreted it, it refers to the old man and old woman who are not able to fast, so they should feed one poor person for each day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fourth condition:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He should be settled (not travelling). If he \r\n    is travelling then it is not obligatory for him to fast, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm \r\n    (fasts) must be made up] from other days&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The scholars are agreed that it is \r\n    permissible for a traveller not to fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is better for the traveller to do that \r\n    which is easier. If fasting is likely to be harmful then it becomes haraam to fast, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:29]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This indicates that whatever is harmful to a \r\n    person is forbidden to him.

With regard to physical harm, that means that the sick person feels that fasting is harming him and causing him pain, \r\n    and will delay his recovery and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to being advised, this means that \r\n    a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor tells him that it will harm him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fifth condition:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There should be no impediments. This applies specifically to women. Women who are menstruating \r\n    or bleeding following childbirth should not fast, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Is it not the case \r\n    that when she gets her period, she does not pray or fast?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So she should not fast and her fast is not valid in this case, according to scholarly consensus.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;We sent no Messenger, but to be obeyed by Allaah&rsquo;s Leave. \r\n    If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to \r\n    you (Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) and \r\n    begged Allaah&rsquo;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for \r\n    them, indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who forgives \r\n    and accepts repentance), Most Merciful.<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>65.&nbsp;But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until \r\n    they make you (O Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) \r\n    judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance \r\n    against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:64-65]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the words &ldquo;<i>But no, by your Lord, they can have no \r\n    Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; \r\n    &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) judge in all disputes between them<\/i>&rdquo;, Allah is swearing \r\n    by His holy Self that no one believes until he makes the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) judge in all his affairs. So \r\n    whatever he rules is the truth to which he must submit both inwardly and \r\n    outwardly. Hence He says &ldquo;<i>and find in themselves no resistance against \r\n    your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission<\/i>&rdquo; i.e., if they \r\n    appoint you as judge, they should obey you in their hearts and not find any \r\n    resistance in themselves against your decision and submit to it both \r\n    outwardly and inwardly. Thus they should submit completely, without any \r\n    resentment or dispute.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tafseer Ibn Katheer<\/i> (2\/349)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are very many verses in the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan which confirm \r\n    this principle and explain it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once we have understood this important principle of faith, \r\n    which is submission to and acceptance of everything that comes from Allah, \r\n    may He be exalted, and submitting to Him both inwardly and outwardly, then \r\n    we will also understand that fasting Ramadan is an important pillar of \r\n    faith, and no person&rsquo;s faith is valid unless he accepts it. So what we have \r\n    to do, when calling this seeker to the religion of Allah, is explain to him \r\n    that there is no problem that would prevent him from entering Islam; Allah \r\n    does not put any hardship upon His slaves in their religion; rather He makes \r\n    it easy for them and relieves them of what that may cause them of hardship \r\n    and difficulty .&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is this man drinks coffee because of what he suffers of \r\n    headaches and migraines, then he can consume the sufficient amount of it \r\n    during the night, then when he begins to fast during the day, he should stop \r\n    doing that until the sun sets. He can also seek help by using the medication \r\n    that will help him with his headache or reduce its effects.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it is well known that if a sick person is affected by his \r\n    sickness during the day, and his sickness will be affected by fasting, then \r\n    it is well known that such individuals are exempted in the religion of \r\n    Allah. So if he gets a headache and needs to take medicine, and cannot fast \r\n    that day, he can break the fast for that day, then when the month has ended \r\n    he should make up the days that he did not fast because of the excuse of \r\n    being sick. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is \r\n    prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may \r\n    become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious).<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>184.&nbsp;[Observing Sawm (fasts)] for a fixed number of days, \r\n    but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made \r\n    up) from other days. And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an \r\n    old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor \r\n    person) (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is \r\n    better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:183-184]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if a person wants to drink coffee because he loves it, \r\n    and he does not want to forsake his desire for it during the day for one \r\n    month of every year, then this person is not ready to believe and submit or \r\n    to adhere truly to any religion, whether it is Islam or any other, because \r\n    religion -- any religion -- requires its followers to be able to obey and \r\n    submit, and to give up the whims and desires of the self. This is the test \r\n    and it is the obstacle that many people fail to overcome, the obstacle of \r\n    whims and desires and going against what the nafs (self) desires. This is \r\n    what Allah mentioned in His Book to His Prophet, as He said (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Have you (O Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; \r\n    &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) seen him who has taken as his il&acirc;h (god) his own vain \r\n    desire?

When a person turns to his \r\n    Lord, Allah turns to him and more so, as it says in the hadeeth narrated \r\n    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of \r\n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah says: &lsquo;I am as \r\n    My slave thinks I am, and I am with him when he remembers Me. If he \r\n    remembers me to himself, I remember him to Myself; if he remembers Me in a \r\n    gathering, I remember him in a gathering better than it; if he draws near to \r\n    Me a handspan, I draw near to him an arm&rsquo;s length; if he draws near to me an \r\n    arm&rsquo;s length, I draw near to him a fathom&rsquo;s length; if he comes to Me \r\n    walking, I go to him at speed.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7405) and Muslim \r\n    (2675).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So be confident, O slave of Allah, that when you turn to \r\n    Allah sincerely, Allah will turn to you and will help you, make things easy \r\n    for you, open your heart, suffice you against what distresses you and \r\n    support you in ways you never imagined. Perhaps Allah will heal you of your \r\n    sickness, or perhaps He will suffice you and relieve you of that addiction \r\n    to what you drink [coffee]. So turn to Allah and think positively of your \r\n    Lord, and tell Him of your need. But the condition is that you should be \r\n    serious about submitting to the command of Allah and accepting what has come \r\n    from Him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to \r\n    Allaah and fears Him, <\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>6.&nbsp;And believes in Al&#8209;Husnaa [The Best, (i.e. either L&acirc; \r\n    il&acirc;ha illAllaah: none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) or a reward \r\n    from Allaah (i.e. Allaah will compensate him for what he will spend in \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s way or bless him with Paradise)],<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>7.&nbsp;We will make smooth for him the path of ease \r\n    (goodness).&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Layl 92:5-7]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted that if a person is sincere in his belief \r\n    in his Lord, then is unable to do some of the duties, or he is overwhelmed \r\n    by his nafs and whims and desires, and falls into sin, that is not the end \r\n    of the road. Rather the gate of repentance and turning to his Lord is open. \r\n    Moreover, he -- despite his sin -- may be forgiven by Allah and has to hope \r\n    that his sin and error will be pardoned. But the problem for which there is \r\n    no solution is if a person remains in a state of shirk (associating others \r\n    with Allah) and turning away from the religion of his Lord. Allah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set \r\n    up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to \r\n    whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has \r\n    indeed invented a tremendous sin&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:48].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sixthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is very important to note that it is not acceptable for \r\n    there to be a relationship or friendship between a man and a woman in Islam; \r\n    rather this is one of the actions of jaahiliyyah (ignorance) and the Muslim \r\n    should be above doing that. Islam forbids free mixing of men and women, men \r\n    entering upon women or being alone with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This has been explained previously in numerous answers under \r\n    the heading &ldquo;Relationships between the sexes&rdquo; on this website; please refer \r\n    to that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6986","question_id":"6986","answers":"Praise be to Allah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Fasting is one of the greatest acts of worship and one of \r\n      the best means of drawing close to Allah. Al-Bukhaari (1904) and Muslim \r\n      narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The \r\n      Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah \r\n      says: &lsquo;Every deed of the son of Adam is for him, except fasting. It is for \r\n      Me and I shall reward for it. Fasting is a shield, so when it is a day \r\n      when one of you is fasting, let him not utter any obscene speech that day \r\n      or raise his voice. If anyone reviles him or tries to fight with him, let \r\n      him say: I am a man who is fasting. By the One in Whose hand is the soul \r\n      of Muhammad, the smell of the mouth of the fasting person will be better \r\n      before Allah on the Day of Resurrection than the fragrance of musk. The \r\n      fasting person has two moments of joy that he enjoys: when he breaks his \r\n      fast he rejoices, and when he meets his Lord he will rejoice because of \r\n      his fasting.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This clearly points to the great status and importance of \r\n    fasting in the religion of Allah, and to the virtue of those who fast and \r\n    the greatness of their reward.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Sa&lsquo;di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are two rewards, one in this world and one in the \r\n    Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reward in this world is seen when the fasting person \r\n    breaks his fast; he rejoices in the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon \r\n    him by enabling him to complete the fast, and he rejoices at fulfilling his \r\n    desires that he refrained from during the day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reward in the hereafter will be his joy when he meets his \r\n    Lord and He is pleased with him and honours him. This later joy is a \r\n    reflection of the earlier joy in this world, for Allah will grant both to \r\n    the fasting person.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It also indicates that when the time of breaking the fast \r\n    comes near, and the fasting person experiences this joy, it is in return for \r\n    what he has endured during the day of the hardship of forsaking his desires. \r\n    This comes under the heading of encouraging and motivating the individual to \r\n    do good. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Bahjat Quloob al-Abraar<\/i>, 96. See also:\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> by Ibn Hajar, 4\/118&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence you will find that the Muslim for whom fasting is \r\n    difficult but he is able to put up with it rejoices at the time of breaking \r\n    his fast, not because the difficulty has ended but because Allah may He be \r\n    exalted, has helped him to put up with it and complete the act of worship to \r\n    Him, may he be glorified. His focus was not on the hardship, waiting for \r\n    relief, rather his focus was on the act of worship and his determination to \r\n    complete it.

One of the most important of these reasons and \r\n    one of the greatest purposes achieved by the fast is so that we may attain \r\n    piety (taqwa), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning) :&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does not give up false speech and acting in accordance \r\n    with it, and ignorant conduct, Allaah has no need of him giving up his food \r\n    and drink.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6057.

The more sins are committed and the more serious they are, the more \r\n    that detracts from the reward of fasting, and it may cancel out the reward \r\n    altogether, so that a person may have denied himself food, drink and all the \r\n    things that break the fast, yet still deprived himself of the reward for \r\n    that by disobeying Allaah. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The one who fasts may get nothing from his fast \r\n    but hunger, and the one who prays qiyaam may get nothing from his qiyaam but \r\n    a sleepless night.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1690; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Ibn Maajah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Subki said in his <i>Fataawa<\/i>, 1\/221-226:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Can the (reward for) fasting be decreased by sins that may \r\n    occur while one is fasting, or not? The view which we favour is that it can \r\n    decrease, and I do not think there is any differing opinion on this matter&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Note that the complete reward for fasting is achieved when it \r\n    is accompanied by acts of worship such as reading Qur&rsquo;aan, observing \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf, praying, giving charity etc, and it may be achieved by avoiding \r\n    haraam things. All of these things make the reward more complete. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to fasting \r\n    that is accompanied by sins &ndash; including tabarruj on the part of a woman &ndash; \r\n    the fast is not invalidated by that, rather it is valid and the fasting \r\n    person has fulfilled his obligation and does not have to make up the fast. \r\n    But the reward for fasting is decreased by that sin and it may be cancelled \r\n    out altogether as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (6\/398):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fasting person should protect his fast from backbiting \r\n    and slander. What this means is that it is more important for the fasting \r\n    person to avoid these sins than others, although those who are not fasting \r\n    should avoid these sins too, as that is enjoined in all situations. If a \r\n    person backbites while fasting, he has committed a sin but that does not \r\n    invalidate his fast in our view. This is the view of Maalik, Abu Haneefah, \r\n    Ahmad and all the scholars except al-Awzaa&rsquo;i who said that the fast is \r\n    invalidated by backbiting, and must be made up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked in <i>Fataawa al-Siyaam<\/i> \r\n    (p. 358): If a person utters some haraam words during the day in Ramadaan \r\n    does that invalidate his fast?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we read the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

In general it means doing that which is commanded and avoiding \r\n    that which is forbidden. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does not give up false speech and acting in \r\n    accordance with it, and ignorant conduct, Allaah has no need of him giving \r\n    up his food and drink.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, the fasting person has to avoid haraam words \r\n    and actions, so he should not backbite about people, or tell lies, or spread \r\n    malicious gossip amongst them, he should not engage in haraam transactions, \r\n    and he should avoid all haraam things. If a person avoids that for a whole \r\n    month then he should be able to adhere to that straight path for the rest of \r\n    the year. But unfortunately many of those who fast do not differentiate \r\n    between the days when they fast and the days when they do not fast, so they \r\n    carry on as usual with haraam speech such as lying, cheating and so on. You \r\n    do not feel that they are observing the dignity of fasting. These actions do \r\n    not invalidate the fast but they do detract from its reward, and may cancel \r\n    out the reward of fasting altogether.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"6991","question_id":"6991","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a woman gets her menses, then the basic principle is that \r\n    this menses remains until she is certain that it has ended, and it is not \r\n    permissible for her to fast or pray when she is not sure as to whether her \r\n    menses has ended or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have discussed that in the answer to question number\r\n    [fatin]106452[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to tell women \r\n    to take their time and not to be hasty until they were certain that they had \r\n    become pure.

There is an Arabic phrase <i>\r\n    imra&rsquo;ah labbah<\/i> (a loving woman) which refers to a woman who loves her child. One only says &ldquo;<i>Labbayk<\/i> (Here I am at your service)&rdquo; to a \r\n    person whom one loves and respects.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It implies sincerity, as in the phrase <i>lubb al-shay&rsquo;<\/i> which means the essence of a thing, and\r\n    <i>lubb al-rajul<\/i> which means a man&rsquo;s mind and heart.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It implies drawing close, as in the word <i>ilbaab<\/i>, which means drawing close, so it emphasizes \r\n    the meaning of seeking to draw closer and closer to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is a symbol of the Tawheed of the religion of Ibraaheem, which is the spirit and aim of Hajj, \r\n    indeed the spirit and aim of all the acts of worship. Hence the Talbiyah is the key to this act of worship that the pilgrim is embarking on.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Talbiyah also includes:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Praise of Allaah, which is the dearest thing \r\n    with which a person may draw close to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It implies recognition of the blessings of \r\n    Allaah, for He is the source of all blessings and the One Who bestows them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it includes acknowledging that all \r\n    sovereignty belongs to Allaah alone, and no one else has any true dominion. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>See <i>Mukhtasar Tahdheeb al-Sunan<\/i>, by \r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim, 2\/335-339&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the pilgrim is reciting the Talbiyah, he feels a connection with all other created beings, \r\n    as they all join with him in submission to Allaah alone and echo his Talbiyah.
