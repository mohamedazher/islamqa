When i started the business was already suffering from debt. This debt was in form of suppliers material and banks riba based loans. I did not understand the depth of riba prohibition at that time. However when i did understood the prohibition i stressed upon working without riba. However my efforts were futile and we had to borrow more in order to repay the previous loan. I discussed my uneasiness with my father about the prohbition in islam to deal with riba, and he was of the view that as soon as we earn enough we will pay off our loans to the people and the banks. However that day was not to come and business was shut down. This happened over a period of ten years during which i was directly involved with the business for 5 years.\r\n\r\nHence, we owe money to the banks and also to approximately 20 people. Among those 20 people are some rich and some very weak suppliers whose businesses were closed because their money was stuck into our business and we are unable to pay.\r\n\r\nHence my first question is 'am i responsible for the debt' keeping in view that i was not fully in control of the business nor the policy setting.

However my wife has gold most of which was given to her by her parents and some of it was given to her by my parents. That gold is not enough to pay off the debt that me and my family has.

Shall my father pay zakaah on it, keeping in view my father has little cash and i will pay the zakaah that he owes. The amount of total zakaah will be my 3 weeks salary approximately.\r\n\r\nWhat is the islamic ruling under the circumstances mentioned above.

There are two views, and Shaykh al-Islam was inclined to favour the second view, which states that hilaal refers to the day the people decide the beginning of the month. Based on that, he favoured the view that the one who sees the moon by himself should not start to fast except with the people, because the hilaal is the day the people decide is the beginning of the month. This is the view that I feel comfortable with, that the fast is the day when the people fast. But there is something that I don't quite understand with regard to his view on what is meant by the words hilaal and shahr. What is the evidence for those who suggested that? And how can that be when the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;fast when you see it&rdquo;?

During Ramadhan I was very sick and the doctor told me to break my fast and take medication which I did. The doctor instructed me to do so for 5 days and my wife insisted that I follow his instructions may Allah reward her.

It has never been a problem and I know my limits as does my wife. On the fourth day of illness I decided to fast but did not tell my wife as she would have argued that the doctor advised to finish the drugs in full. I was confident that Allah had returned my health and wanted to fast. So I did. That morning we engaged in foreplay and my wife did not stop either when I told her to. Unfortunately, she thought this was a game as we have played it before and continued. Then as I pushed her away the excitement overcame me and I ejaculated. As you can imagine I was shocked. As was my wife when I revealed I was fasting. So do I need to fast 60 days in a row? Or make up one day?

When we first came to Makkah al-Mukarramah, we did not do &lsquo;umrah and we delayed it until the eighth day (of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah). Whilst I was in ihraam, we stayed with a group of girls like us, and even though I was in ihraam they made me put on make up. I objected to that just because I didn&rsquo;t like it, not because it is not permissible to wear adornment when in ihraam, because I forgot about that. Then after that I used Nivea cream to remove the make up. I do not know whether I have to offer anything because of this action of mine.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease note that I was very careful to avoid fragrances and I did not use soap or anything that had a scent, and I did not do anything forbidden except this.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen after that, when we wanted to do &lsquo;umrah on the eighth day (of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah), I had an excuse (menses) until the second of the days of al-Tashreeq. Please note that on the first of the days of al-Tashreeq our guardian stoned the Jamarah on our behalf, i.e., Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah, and we exited ihraam before doing Tawaaf al-Ifaadah, and this is permissible for the one who has done &lsquo;umrah. But I was doing Qiraan and I had not done &lsquo;umrah, but I exited ihraam because I forgot, then I offered a sacrifice. Before we left Makkah, those who were with me did tawaaf al-wadaa&rsquo; (farewell tawaaf) and I did tawaaf al-ifaadah and saa&rsquo;i, regarding it as the &lsquo;umrah of Hajj.

It is the Black Stone that is situated in the south-east corner of the Holy Ka&rsquo;bah in the Sanctuary of Makkah al-Mukarramah. Jalaal al-Suyooti said: When al-Mutee&rsquo; Lillaah bought the black Stone from Abu Taahir al-Qarmati, the hadeeth scholar &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Ukaym came and said: &ldquo;We have two signs in our stone: it floats on water and it does not get hot in the fire.&rdquo; So he brought a stone that had been rubbed with perfume and wrapped in brocade to make him think that this was the Black Stone. They placed it in water and it sank; then they put it in the fire and it cracked. Then he brought another stone and did likewise to it, and the same things happened. Then he brought the Black Stone and put it in water, and it floated; then he put it in the fire and it did not get hot. &lsquo;Abd-Allaah said: &ldquo;This is our Stone.&rdquo; Abu Taahir al-Qarmati was amazed by this and said: &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; &lsquo;Abd-Allaah said: &ldquo;It was narrated that the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;The Black Stone is Allaah&rsquo;s right hand on His earth. It will come on the Day of Resurrection with a tongue with which it will testify about those who kissed it in sincerity or otherwise. It does not sink in water and it does not get hot in fire&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Black Stone is the point at which tawaaf begins, at the south-eastern corner of the Holy Ka&rsquo;bah. It was originally one of the precious stones of Paradise. Its original colour is white like the maqaam (Maqaam Ibraaheem). It is the place where tears should be shed, and where du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are answered. It is Sunnah to touch it and kiss it. It is the right hand of Allaah on His earth in the sense that it is the place where a man renews his covenant with Allaah and his repentance. On the Day of Resurrection it will testify for all those who touched it. Whoever swears an oath whilst touching it, it is like&nbsp; touching the Hand of the Most Merciful, and touching it erases sins. It is the place touched by the lips of the Prophets, the righteous and pilgrims performing Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah and visiting the holy places.

The other daughter and one of the sons have finished their education and are working now, while the other two sons are still having their education. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe mother was working with the father. And they used to save their salaries together, and she approved to this of course (she used to say to him: &ldquo;what matters is that I take the bonus of retiring, and this is what already happened) while the husband takes what they both save and buy properties in his name.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe questions:&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen the heirs divide the heritage, should they count the mother&rsquo;s salaries and discount it from the entire heritage, then divide what remains on all of them (mother, two daughters and three sons)? The mother says that the heritage will not be divided before every one finishes his education and gets married. Then the heritage will be divided according to the Islamic Sharia, boy&rsquo;s share is double the girl&rsquo;s one. Is this permissible? When should the heritage be divided according to Sharia? &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe mother does not want anyone of the children to know how much the heritage exactly is so that no one says I should take more than my share when time of dividing comes. Is that permissible? &nbsp;\r\nBefore the father died he bought a car and wrote it in his oldest son&rsquo;s name according to his wife&rsquo;s wish. As this son&rsquo;s position allows him to easily return the licence if it was taken for some reason. The father had the intention to buy a car for every one of his children for the same price, and to buy a car for half of that price for the unmarried daughter. He paid more than half the price of it already before he died. He had the intention to give the married daughter as much as he would give the unmarried one as well. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter the father died the mother said: &ldquo;the car is for the eldest son, his father bought it for him because he is obedient, and the father is free to give whoever he wills of his children from his own money, as long as the son is obedient&rdquo; and as for the car of the unmarried daughter, the mother reclaimed the money as she cannot continue paying the other half, because if she withdraws money from the bank, the whole heritage will be transferred to the &ldquo;welfare trust&rdquo;, which will keep the shares of the underage children aside. She will not then be able to do anything about the underage children&rsquo;s shares except via the welfare trust. Is that permissible? &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe mother&rsquo;s reasons for not dividing the heritage are, as I said, the welfare trust. She says about the underage children: &ldquo;is it fair that I spend on them until they grow up and after that they take their whole shares regardless what I spent on them of my own money? &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe mother asked her three older children to grant her power of attorney that allows her to have full control of the heritage. She will also ask the underage children to do the same when they reach the legal age for this. What is the ruling of every point of the above mentioned?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMay Allah reward you and accept your deeds purely for His sake.

As for what I need as capital to start my own business, it is permissible to take it from him as a loan. But now my father wants to help me as a father, and work alongside me in the store.

This can be kept track of with a great deal of effort, but what I cannot keep track of is the fact that he may buy food for the house, then he finds that the store needs it, so he brings some of what he bought for the house and puts it in the store, without my knowledge and without consulting me, and without telling me how much it cost so I can repay him.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that he is not happy with the idea of my returning the money to him, he regards it as my money and my brothers&rsquo; money, and he is working and bringing this money for us, so he will never accept the money being returned to him.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe third problem is that he is not convinced that his money is haraam &ndash; if it is haraam. He thinks that it is the kind of &ldquo;necessity which means that forbidden things are permitted&rdquo; and his government job pays only 400 Egyptian pounds &ndash; not the difference. We are a family of five, two of whom are studying in university. He thinks that the wealth of the state is all haraam because the state deals with riba-based loans and imposes taxes and allows trade in alcohol, so everyone who works has some haraam element in his income.&nbsp;\r\nMy question now is:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1- What is the ruling on my father&rsquo;s wealth? Does the principle of &ldquo;necessity which means that forbidden things are permitted&rdquo; apply here? If that is the case, is it permissible for us to make use of his haraam earnings because he is looking after us?\r\n\r\n2- How can I work out how much money my father has contributed to my business, when he himself does not know how much it is?\r\n\r\n3- How can I return this money to him &ndash; if I have to return it &ndash; if he refuses to take it? Is it permissible for me to insist and to pay back the debts I owe to the people to whom it is owed?\r\n\r\n4- What is permissible to me of my father&rsquo;s wealth? If he dies, is it permissible for me to inherit his wealth?.","question_url":"\/en\/45018","question_no":"45018","status":"done"},{"id":"7862","category_id":"314","question":"Accepting gifts and donations from haraam wealth.","question_full":"Some Muslims here in Britain accumulate their wealth from both halaal and haraam sources, because they are businessmen and some of the things in which they deal are alcohol and pork.

Its idea may be summed up as follows: a person buys the company&rsquo;s products &ndash; which consists of programs (software), a web site and e-mail &ndash; for 99 dollars, and after buying he is given the opportunity to market its products to others in return for a set commission. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen this person convinces two others to join the program, meaning that they both buy the company&rsquo;s products, then they will also have the right to attract other marketers in return for commission.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen each of these also convinces two more people to join, and so on. In this way there will be a network of followers who join the program, like a pyramid.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWith regard to the way in which the commission is calculated, the company stipulates that the number of individuals who are attracted through the purchaser (participant) and those under him in the pyramid should be no less than 9 in order to earn the commission. But this is on the condition that the number of members under each of the first two cannot be less than two, and the commission will be $55. The commission is paid for each 9 persons, and each nine persons in the pyramid scheme is called a level.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBecause the pyramid may increase in size each time a new level is added to it, this commission increases greatly every time.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo if we assume that the pyramid grows each month, i.e. that each month two people join each person in the pyramid (as is assumed by the company, according to its website), this means that the commission that the member gets will be more than $25,000 in twelve months, and it will keep growing every month.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is what is so tempting about these schemes. For a small amount of money, no more than $100, the participant can get hundreds or thousands times that amount.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHence these companies market these schemes with promises of great riches within a short period of time, by developing and increasing the size of the pyramid.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy question: What is the ruling on this operation, especially since it is so widespread and there are so many different opinions on it?.","question_url":"\/en\/40263","question_no":"40263","status":"done"},{"id":"8107","category_id":"319","question":"Ruling on selling TVs, VCRs and Playstation.","question_full":"I have a store selling electrical equipment.

I am trying my best to get a job this summer but have not got yet. My question is, if I am unable to earn $8000 within 3 months .... can I use my credit card to pay the tution fee back. I know I cannot pay the money to the bank and will have to give interest. Moreover, I am engaged with a girl who's parents have agreed to get us married.

How does one solve this dilemma?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3-    One of the calamities befalling Islamic societies nowadays is people slandering Allah, the religion, and the messenger (PBUH). These sinful Muslims and other Jews are doing this shameful acts a lot whilst working. There is no power and no strength except with Allah. Is it permissible for me to stay with them whilst they are slandering? Or shall I leave this job? Knowing that it is very rare to find religious brother working in the field of the free business.

So none of us dared to withdraw any money without referring to him, out of respect for him. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen my brother withdrew all the money in the account following an argument which arose between my brother and my sister. My father (may Allaah have mercy on him) was on the girls&rsquo; side, which made my brother (may Allaah forgive him) withdraw all the money which my father had deposited in his account then handed over the documentation. When he (my brother) found out about this will, he started court proceedings to prove the will legally invalid. When his father found out about it from the bank, he was deeply shocked, and he told him to put the money back because he needed it, as he was sick. But my brother refused to return the money, which had a bad effect on my father. My father died angry with my brother, and he had written a will leaving one-third of his money to his daughters; this will was intended as a punishment to my brother which my father wrote before he died, understanding fully what he was saying.\r\n\r\nI myself refused to accept this will because I was not comfortable with it, and I insisted on taking only that which was due to me according to sharee&rsquo;ah. I advised my sisters to ignore this will, in order to correct any mistake that my father may have made and so as to uphold good relations with my brother as Allaah enjoins upon us to do. But my many attempts did not succeed, and they went ahead and executed the will through the courts. The tears of my mother (may Allaah have mercy on her) did not succeed in deterring them from insisting on the will being executed. I also tried several times to deter my brother from entering into a dispute with my sisters in the court, in order to protect the name and reputation of our father. I asked him to consider this as a punishment in this world for what he had done to my father. But he refused to give up what he considered to be his right for any reason, and all of them accused me of not supporting the truth. I kept myself out of this dispute by appointing a lawyer to declare my objection to this matter from the outset.\r\n\r\nI hope that you can advise me of the shar&rsquo;i ruling and what my siblings&rsquo; position is according to sharee&rsquo;ah.

Now, with the scholars over here, they have no doubt that since it is compulsory on a car, its ok to take this insurance. But in regards to the Property damage, it is still unclear... i.e. Suppose 'xyz' hit a car and there was some damage to the other car and the person got unjuries.. This CTP would cover the unjuries to the person, but not on the damages to the other person's car... So, this person 'xyz' has to pay for the expenses of fixing the other party's car from his pocket..

I am now a close student to the teacher which means he teaches me more of the style and chinese medicine. In my position I must help the school grow by trying to get more people at the school. My intention is to get the people in the school so they can learn self defense. The problem is that in this school there are two types of (major)shirk that go on regularly, but the teacher does not force the student to perform these things if he doesn't want to. Is it haram that I bring people to the school knowing they might engage in these activities.

Camping spots are usually near the water, so it includes aquatic activities (among naked kuffar), hiking, cycling, etc. I feel quite uncomfortable with the idea; I just feel that it is inappropriate for a muslimah to do that kind of activities, especially with a long dress and hijab, and I don't want my daughters to get used to that kind of life.  I have talked about my feelings to my husband, but he kind of laughed at my feelings, saying that anyway, he wasn't including me in his projects, that he would go alone with our daughters (which I'm totally against), thus dividing the family instead of finding an activity that would please everyone.  I see him asking the kuffar around us for good camping spots, and it really gets on my nerves.
