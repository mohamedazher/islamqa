    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl) and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred<sup>1</sup>. The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, a translated meaning of which is: \"O' You who believe, do not get approach salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform ghusl\" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said \"I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned this to the Prophet peace be upon him (or it was mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, then perform ghusl\"<sup>2</sup>.

The sharia \n  (laws of Islam) have allowed for the praying person in some cases excessive \n  movement even if he were to change direction from qibla, as evident in \n  the hadith of Abu Huraira, (may Allah be pleased with him), where he \n  said: \"The Messenger of Allah  (peace be upon \n  him), said: Kill the two black things while in prayer: the snake and scorpion. \n  \"<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>Also, preventing a person from passing in the place of prostration \n  by pushing (or even fighting him if he insists) is prescribed, as related in \n  Bukhari from hadith Abi Saleh Al-Samman, who said: \"I saw Aba \n  Saeed Al-Khudri on Friday praying with something in front of him to protect \n  him from [passing] people, and a young man from Bani Abi Muaet wanted to pass \n  in front of him in the place of prostration. So Abu Saeed pushed the mans \n  chest, so the man looked [around] and did not find any place from which to walk \n  except in front of him, so he tried to pass in front of him again. Abu Saeed \n  pushed him harsher than the first time, so he cursed Abu Saeed. Then the young \n  man went to Marwan and complained about Abu Saeeds action and Abu Saeed \n  entered after him at Marwans place so Marwan said: What is the matter \n  with you, doing that to your brothers son oh Abu Saeed.? He said: \n  I heard the Prophet  (peace be upon him) saying: \n  \"If one of you prays with something in front of him protecting him from \n  [passing] people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should \n  push him, and if he refuses to [turn back], then fight him, for he is a shaitan \n  (satan).\"<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>From the book What Should You Do in \n  the Following Situations... ?</p>\n<p><sup>1 </sup>Sunan Abu Dawood, number \n  922, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 815.<br><sup>2 </sup>Sunan Abu Dawood, \n  number 921, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 814.<br><sup>3 </sup>Narrated al-Bukhari \n  Fath 1/582.<br></p>",

When a man who used to sell wine or drugs \nrepents he should not return the amounts to those who used to buy from him. Nor should he \nwho used to swear for others as a false witness return the amounts he earned to those for \nwhose benefit he used to swear. The reason being that if he returns the amounts to him who \npaid, then he will be depositing with him both the unlawful money as well as the unlawful \ncommodity that he took through bribe or wages of sin. Therefore it will be enough if he gets \nrid of such unlawful earning himself.

    "question": "There is another problem that has been worrying me for some time—namely, I committed fornication with a woman. How do I repent? Can I marry her in order to cover up the whole affair?\n<br>\nAnother man says he committed fornication outside his country, and he knows that the woman conceived and delivered a child. Is this his child? And is it obligatory for him to bear the costs of the child’s upbringing?",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>\n    Questions of this sort are \n    asked so often and by so many that it is time Muslims paid serious attention \n    to their reformation in the light of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic \n    teachings), in order that such things do not occur in the first place. \n    Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily \n    contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full \n    hijab (women’s Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in \n    particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted \n    travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question \n    about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations.</p>\n    <p>\n    Either the man did it by force, \n    that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr \n    (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm \n    he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the \n    matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to \n    the law of shari’ah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a \n    woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except \n    repentance.

He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that.

    "question": "What should one who is informed about the correct direction of the qiblah \nduring a prayer?",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p>If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the \nright direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is \nalso true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been \nperformed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration \nby Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that:\n<p>While the Prophet \n (peace be upon him) was praying towards \nBayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of \nmeaning): </p>\n<ul><li>Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards \nthe heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that \nshall please you, so turn your face in the direction of \nAl-Masjid Al-Haram. </li>\n</ul><p>&nbsp; (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). </p>\n<ul><li>A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found \nthem (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of \nruku‘ in the Fajr prayer in the second rak‘ah. He \nshouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. \nSo, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet \n \nand his Companions) have. </li>\n</ul><p>&nbsp; (Sahih Musim, No. 527) </p>\n<p>&nbsp;If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it \nwas made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of \nqiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying \ntogether in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some \ntowards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference \nof opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was \ncomplete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If \nthere was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he \nshould follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah.<sup>1</sup> \nFor the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if \nhe can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability \nwith the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is \nreliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and \ncomplete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of \nthose who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform \nthem of the correct direction of qiblah.</p>\n<p>If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and \nprayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was \ncareless.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Al-Mughni, 1/473.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup>Al-Mughni, 1/490</p>",

    "question": "What should one do if one is praying behind an imam and one misses one \nof the obligatory parts (arkaan)of the prayer?",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p>If someone is praying in a congregation and the loud speaker stops working or the \nperson is drowsy, and he lags behind the Imam by one or more obligatory acts \n(arkaan) of prayer (i.e., the Imam performed it and he could not because of not hearing \nthe Imam’s voice), then when he returns to consciousness or the sound of the speaker \nreturns back, he should complete the missed obligatory acts and then continue with the \nImam. This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam \nrecited a verse that contains the word of prostration (sajdah) and the people \nmisunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when \nthe Imam says takbeer for ruku‘ at the end of the verse and performs ruku‘, some of \nthe followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the takbeer for \nthe prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from \nthe ruku‘ saying “sami‘a Allahu li man hamidah”, they return back (stand up) from \ntheir prostration. Thus, they missed the act of ruku‘ and standing up from it. So it is \nincumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. \nThis is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally \nlags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long \nsupplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the \nmajority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive \nobligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful.<sup>1</sup> However, in \nprinciple the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet \n (peace be upon \nhim):\nThe Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him. When he makes \nthe takbeer, make the takbeer, when he goes into ruku‘, make ruku‘. When he \nsays “samia‘ Allahu li man hamidah” (Allah hears he who praises Him), say \n“Rabbanaa lakal Hamd” (O our Lord! To You belongs the Praise). When he \ngoes into sajdah, make sajdah. If he prays sitting, then all should be sitting. <p>&nbsp; (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 689) </p>",

If he did not appoint anyone and the people prayed individually, this would be acceptable, and this is the opinion taken by Imam Al-Shafi‘i.

    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p>If someone, after raising his head from ruku‘,\nremembers that he did not say the supplications of ruku‘, he should not return\nback to the ruku‘ because the requirement for supplication of ruku‘\nhas been dropped by virtue of his rising it.

This is because tasbeeh (subhaana Rabbi al-Azeem, How\nPerfect is my Lord, the Supreme, or another supplication of ruku‘) is wajib\n(required), and forgetting it makes the prostration of forgetfulness necessary. If he was\npraying behind an Imam, the he is released from the requirement of sujood for his\nforgetfulness (al-Mughni 1/679).",

    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If blood continues to flow and a woman is still waiting to purify herself, and it exceeds 15 days, then she should fall back to her normal period as a reference. Accordingly, she must make ghusl, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/5595\" target=\"_blank\">start praying</a> , and in addition make up the prayers for the days which she did not pray since the time when her normal period would have ended.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she was still waiting for the end of the period. In this case, she makes ghusl immediately, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/56\" target=\"_blank\">starts praying</a> , and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reason for this is that the longest that a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/247317\" target=\"_blank\">woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days</a> according to Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thus, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/65570\" target=\"_blank\">if the flow continues past 15 days</a> , then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/68818\" target=\"_blank\">istihadah</a> (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.)</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding making up the missed prayers, she should pray them consecutively in order by intention, in one session, and she can rest if she gets tired.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Allah knows best.</p>",

This situation about \nwhich this sister is asking is a common one and occurs \noften as a result of a clash of desires between parents \nand their daughter. It could be for a benefit or interest \nthe mother or father sees and the young woman doesnt, \nand each regards the issue from a different perspective \nor with a particular consideration. And perhaps the \nopinion of the parents is the appropriate and correct one \nas a result of their prior trials and longer experience in \nlife, and perhaps the woman sometimes looks to the \nappearance of the groom more than anything else, \nwhereas the parents may look to other considerations, \nsuch as his family status, or his long-term career or \nemployment. Of course none of this means that the \nwomans opinion isnt sometimes more correct and \npreferable, particularly when the opinion of the parents \nstems from a benefit they may realize if the marriage is \naccomplished, and they do not actually make the \npriority their daughter who is the most important thing in \nthis issue. And while being vigilant in advising you of the \nimportance of obeying ones parents and struggling with \noneself to realize their wishes and desires and giving \ntheir opinion the priority, the point must clearly be made \nthat the following two hadeeth from the Prophet \n  \n(peace be upon him) must be abided by and carried out, \nas within them are the complete answer to your question \nand questions from others in similar situations:\n<p>The first hadeeth:</p>\n<p>If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) \npleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry \nhim, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and \nvast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan \nTirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih \nul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to \nrefer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the \ncutting off of relations among the people and relatives, \nand the spreading of hatred)</p>\n<p>The second:</p>\n<p>Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a \nyoung woman came to the Prophet \n  (peace be \nupon him) and said, My father married me to his \nbrothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his \nstanding among the people, so the Prophet \n  \n(peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. \nasserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned \non her approval and negated by her refusal). So she \nsaid, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I \nwanted women to know that fathers cannot force their \nwill in these matters.</p>\n<p>And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn \nBuraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her \nand said, My father married me to his brothers son in \norder to raise his standing among the people and I am \nunwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the \nProphet \n  (peace be upon him) comes. So the \nProphet \n  (peace be upon him) came and she \ninformed him of the situation, so he sent for her father \nand invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in \nthe brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I \nhave authorized and endorsed what my father has done, \nbut I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter \nor not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min \nSunanihi and it is sahih).</p>\n<p>I ask Allah for you success and guidance to that in \nwhich there is blessings for you and your family, and \nmay the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our \nProphet Muhammad \n .</p>",

If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).”</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">&nbsp;And the word “akhdan” that appears in this ayah (appearing above as “secret intrigues”) means intimate friend or companion, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/229206\" target=\"_blank\">in this case refers to a lover</a> , and Allah has indicated in Surat al-Ahzab (33:53) that a condition for talking with women when it is needed is: (a translation of the meaning)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">&nbsp;“…and if you ask them (women) for something you want, ask them from behind a hijab (both in the sense of a physical barrier such as a screen or wall, as well as in clothing); that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs…”</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And Allah has commanded <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10221\" target=\"_blank\">women not to speak with soft, sensual voices with a man</a> who is ajnabi (lit. foreign, meaning one to whom marriage is not forbidden) so that he is not tempted by their voices, and so as not to provoke feelings of lust. Allah ta'ala said in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 32, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">“… if you do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire; but utter sufficient and appropriate speech.” (33:32)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">So how could it possibly be permissible after all of these injunctions to establish love or <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2584\" target=\"_blank\">friendship relations among women and men</a> who are ajanib (marriageable)?</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"direction: ltr;\" id=\"conditions-to-marry-a-second-wife-in-islam\">Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam</h3>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And as for the original matter of the question, Allah (subhanahu wa-ta’ala), Who is al-Hakim (All Wise) al-Khabir (All Experienced), and Who is more knowledgeable about the human beings He created than they themselves are about themselves, has ordained that a man is allowed to marry whom he wills among women as long as he does not bond in marriage under his care and responsibility <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/201309\" target=\"_blank\">more than four women</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And this is conditioned upon him <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22218\" target=\"_blank\">dealing justly among them</a> the known justice specified by Shari’ah which includes overnight stays and spending.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">If he does not have the ability and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10091\" target=\"_blank\">capacity to deal with such justice</a> , then he should suffice with one, as Allah indicates in Surat al-Nisa in ayah 3, which has a meaning that can be translated as:</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">“… marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one…” (4:3)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And Allah’s Shari’ah (law) is all just and wise, and He ordains what He wills and does what He wants and it is incumbent upon as human beings to believe and have faith and submit and obey and abide by the Shari`ah, otherwise then we are not Muslims nor mu’minin (believers). As Allah also said in Surat al-Nisa, ayah 65, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">“But no, by your Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction” (4:65)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">and in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 36, a meaning that can be translated as:</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">“It is not fitting for a mu’min (believing man) or mu’minah (believing woman) when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Apostle he is indeed strayed on a manifestly wrong path.” (33:36)</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"direction: ltr;\" id=\"second-marriage-in-islam-do-you-need-permission-from-your-first-wife\">Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife?</h3>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Furthermore, no evidence appears either in the Quran or sunnah requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry another wife, and therefore he is not required to ask her permission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr; \">However, he needs to be judicious in taking this decision and to weigh it carefully with respect to benefits and drawbacks and to look with the eye of wisdom at all of the considerations pertaining to the matter, and he should strive all he can to conciliate, reassure, and satisfy his first wife, in order to ease and mitigate the effect of the matter upon her.</p>",

    "question": "<p style=\"direction: ltr; \">I live in the united states. How much is Nesab el-Zakat in US dollars?</p>",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p style=\"direction: ltr; \">Nisab ul-Zakat for naqd (gold and silver) is defined as the minimum amount of naqd specified by shari’a below which one is not required to pay zakat, whereas if one’s wealth exceeds it then zakat becomes incumbent.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And it is known that zakat ul-maal (wealth) in shari’a is required for the two types of naqd—gold and silver—and what serves their function in modern times (commonly referred to as cash), whether it is dollars or riyals or pounds or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Nisab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Nisab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">It is well known that there is a noticeable disparity between the value of nisab for gold and that of silver in our times. The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days). If the amount reaches the value of nisaab for silver or more, then he should pay from it for every 1000 dollars, 25 dollars (i.e., 2.5%) to be spent in the prescribed benficiaries as specified by shari’ah, and we ask Allah to aid us and help us succeed in haqq il-maal wa salla allahu ala nabiyyana muhammad</p>",

And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">I say:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, \"and let the other party ...\"</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Second Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as \"The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused.\" (Quran 68:42-43)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">The evidence here is from several facets amongst them:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Allah&nbsp;punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadith of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him \"do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)\"? He said yes, then the Prophet said \"fahayhala\" which means something like \"then go answer the call.\" This hadith is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Third Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as \"Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing\". (Quran 2:43)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">The proof therein is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">That Allah&nbsp;ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">His statement which was translated as \"with those that are bowing\" is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">B- Evidence From The Sunnah</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">First Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Abu Huraira&nbsp;narrated that the Messenger of Allah said \"The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them.\" Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">This hadith proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadith which follow:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadith of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer \"I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer\". This is not in contradiction to the hadith of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadith of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation.</div>\n\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">The second: Confirming what the Messenger cancelled. For he never punished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept from them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them and Allah.</div>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">As such the hadith of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the obligation of salat al jama'ah.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Second Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, \"Oh Messenger of Allah, I do not have someone to guide me to the Mosque,\" and thus asked the Messenger to grant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, the Messenger called him and said \"Do you hear the call? \", he said \"yes\". He said, \"Then answer.\" Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by Ibn Maktoom that he said: \"Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have a guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?\" He said \"Do you hear the call?\" Ibn Maktoom replied \"Yes\". The Prophet then said \"I cannot find an excuse for you\". If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in congregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see?</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, \"This is an order to pray in congregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah\".</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive evidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about supportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply preference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying preference, and nothing would remain obligatory.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Third Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the Prophet said, \"Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.\" This is a sound, and authentic hadith.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat \"... and mind you this chain (referring to chain of narration of the above hadith) is authentic.\" This hadith has been narrated by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also been traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken about this hadith, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic word mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to the Prophet contradict their claim.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">That hadith states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and this judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order which implies preference, and not obligation.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Fourth Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then let him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda (guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to establish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be abandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of your prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that purifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these mosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), and raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would be carried between two men until he is stood in the row.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">In another narration he said, \"the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and amongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called\". Narrated by Muslim.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">The evidence in this hadith is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of confirmed hypocrisy.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is obligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in whose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites in their attributes.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Fifth Evidence</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah said, \"If there are three let one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is the one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount memorized, and ability to recite it properly)\".</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah said \"There are not three in a town where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established amongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to jama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one\". Authentic hadith narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Sixth Evidence</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the Mu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got up from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the Masjid. Then Abu Huraira said \"as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the Messenger) \". Narrated by Muslim.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal Qasim , and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of the sunnah of Abal Qasim . And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then he has left something which is obligatory.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim servant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will find more and more.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to reject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled differently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded differently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and Sunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become Imam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Know this because it is beneficial to you...</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the companions of the Messenger , have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no narrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. And following is what has been confirmed by them:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Ibn Mas'ood said, \"and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known.\" (5th evidence)</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have stated, \"Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.\" (3rd evidence)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: \"These are statements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is not one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of these pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one another. Verily in Allah is our success.\"</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">These are the statements of the people of knowledge:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3/349), \"More than one of the companions were of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is no salat for him.\"</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Ata'a bin Rabah said, \"There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or country side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.\"</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in congregation, out of pity, he should not obey her.</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Al-Awza'i said: \"There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or the daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer or not.\"</li>\n\t<li style=\"direction: ltr;\">Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, Al-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and most of Ahl Al-hadith, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning the obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as such from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.)</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is correct; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the acceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of Zaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">We ask Allah to help us in remembering and thanking him and better worshipping him. Allah the exalted knows best.</p>",

However, it is better to act according to the first opinion. (See Fatawa Al-Hajj Wal 'Umrah by Ibn Baz, p. 80; Al Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/47 and 49; Al-Mughni, 3/414)</li>\n</ul>",

    "title": "Minimum Distance for Shortening Prayer",
    "question": "<p style=\"direction: ltr; \">What is the distance which, once one has set out for it, allows one to shorten the prayer?</p>",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The majority of scholars comprising the Malikis and the Shafi’is and the Hanbalis have taken the opinion that the recognized distance for one who has undertaken its travel in <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82751\" target=\"_blank\">shortening the prayer</a> is four burud (an antiquated unit of distance), which is two average day's travel by heavily-loaded camels (equivalent to 88.7 km in distance).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Among what they have quoted as evidence is what was authentically (sahih) narrated by Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60358\" target=\"_blank\">shorten the prayers</a> and break fasting at a distance of four BURUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This quoted distance is approximate and not exactly limited as per the majority of scholars, and thus what is slightly less is exempted as well.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some scholars including Ibn Qadamah and Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his pupil Ibn al-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111894\" target=\"_blank\">travel in practice</a> and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'ah such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Quran and sunnah, as in the example of Surat al-Nisa, verses 4:101-102:</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.\"</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to `Umar ibn al-Khattab \"Verily Allah has said ' if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure.\" 'Umar said, \"[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' \" (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.)</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Khalid ibn Asid said to Ibn `Umar, \"How can you shorten the prayer when Allah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear' ,\" so Ibn `Umar said, \"O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'ahs during travel.\" (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via ‘Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.)</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The verse expresses the permission for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/48979\" target=\"_blank\">shortening the prayer</a> for one who <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82658\" target=\"_blank\">travels</a> without specifically restricting the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/105844\" target=\"_blank\">distance</a> . Thus the Quran and sunnah mention \"travel\" and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particular case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (regarding the minimum required distance).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Allah knows best.</p>",

It is a condition that the sin be given up immediately and that there should be true feelings of regret in the heart. This should be accompanied by the firm intention not to fall into it again. Now, with these conditions met, if he falls into it again, then this will be considered a new sin altogether, requiring a new repentance and with no connection to those of the past.</p>\n\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>",

    "title": "Repentance for Neglecting Acts of Worship",
    "question": "<p style=\"direction: ltr; \">I have neglected many rights of Allah in the past, such as prayers, fasts, and zakah (paying poor-due). Am I required to repeat them or to compensate for them?</p>",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p style=\"direction: ltr; \">As far as the five daily prayers are concerned, the preferred opinion is that the repetition or compensation (or what is known as qadha in Arabic), is not obligatory for the reason that prayers are obligatory at a particular time, and once that time has elapsed, there is no way to offer them. However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right. (See Madarij Al-Salikin for further details).</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And Allah knows best.</p>",

    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>Yes, repentance from a particular sin is acceptable even if the repentant insists on another sin which is of a different nature and not the same as the one from which he has repented.</p>\n<p>For example, if a man repents from having accepted interest but not from drinking wine, his repentance over accepting interest is acceptable, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>But if he repents from simple interest but not compound interest then his repentance is invalid.</p>\n<p>Or if he repents from taking drugs but insists on drinking wine, or vice versa, then the repentance is invalid too.</p>\n<p>It will also be incorrect and unacceptable if a man repents from adultery with one woman but commits it with another.</p>\n<p>In all of these cases, they have only shifted from one variety of sin to another within the same kind.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45887\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Will Allah Forgive Me If I Repeat the Same Sin?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Persisting in sin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46683\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acceptance of repentance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/289765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conditions of Repentance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23425\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sin and its Effects on the One Who Commits it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>",

    "title": "Returning stolen money when owner not reachable",
    "question": "I stole from certain people. Now I have repented, but I do not know where \nthey live. Perhaps another may say,\" I embezzled some money from a firm \nwhich has closed up its business.\" Or yet another person may say,\" I \npilfered some material from an establishment which has shifted its \npremises.\" What shall I do now?",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p>In all these cases it is incumbent upon you to search for them to the extent of your \nmeans. If you find them, return them their right. If the owner or owners have died, then \ntheir right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate \nthem, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the \nreward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some \nway or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the \nHereafter. \n<p>This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin \n(1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from \nal-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him \nwhat he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander \nrefused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that \nthey have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking \nhis advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each \nsoldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is \none-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic \ngovernment which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth \nof all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give \nconvey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan \n[who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is \ndearer to me than half of what I rule over.' Imam Ibn Taymiyya has also given a similar \nruling. (See Madarij)</p>",

    "question": "I have committed backbiting involving a person or a group of people, or have unjustly slandered some people regarding things with which they didn't have anything to do. Is it a condition of repentance that I should inform them and seek their pardon? And if this is not required then how do I repent?",
    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>The answer will depend on \n    the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that \n    if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not \n    be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their \n    forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering \n    details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments \n    about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and \n    seeks their forgiveness. </p>\n    <p>But if the case is the \n    opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous \n    backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to \n    happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, \n    rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them \n    to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know \n    and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order \n    adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of \n    things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against \n    the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and \n    brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity \n    where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the \n    following manner. </p>\n    <p>\n    Evoke \n    in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah \n    accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing \n    in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier \n    before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged \n    were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by \n    mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the \n    presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend \n    the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to \n    Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had \n    wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for \n    further elucidation). </p>\n    <p>You must note, dear \n    brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the \n    material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting \n    and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they \n    are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must \n    not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those \n    concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause \n    increase in distress.</p>\n    <p>\n    And Allah knows best.</p>",

    "answer": "<p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p style=\"direction: ltr; \">The basis for the answer is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: \"He upon whom his brother has a right, be it of the nature of money or honor, let him compensate for it before he is made to compensate for it on a day when there will be neither dinar nor dirham to deal with. Instead, if he has a good deed in his account it will be taken away from him and given to the person he had wronged. And if he has no good deeds in his account, sins of the other person will be taken from him and added to his account\" (al-Bukhari). Accordingly, the repentant can escape the questioning only by either giving back to the people wronged their due or seeking their forgiveness. If they forgive, he need not worry, but if they do not, then he must return their dues.</p>\n\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">And Allah knows best.</p>",
