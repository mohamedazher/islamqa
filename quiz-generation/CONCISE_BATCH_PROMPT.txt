QUIZ GENERATION - CONTENT-SPECIFIC OPTIONS REQUIRED

Generate 100 quiz questions from batch-XXX-input.json following these requirements:

1. READ BOTH question AND answer fields fully
2. CLARIFY ambiguous titles using answer context
3. CREATE CONTENT-SPECIFIC OPTIONS (NOT generic templates!)

CRITICAL - OPTIONS MUST BE CONTENT-SPECIFIC:

❌ WRONG (generic templates - DON'T use):
  a) It is permissible (halal) in Islam
  b) It is forbidden (haram) in Islam
  c) It is obligatory (fard)
  d) It depends on circumstances

✅ CORRECT (content-specific - extract from answer):
  a) The gold that was purchased with his money
  b) The original cash amount he gave
  c) Nothing, engagement gifts cannot be returned
  d) The current market value of the gold in cash

HOW TO CREATE OPTIONS:
1. Read full answer text
2. Extract SPECIFIC details of the ruling
3. Create correct option using exact ruling details
4. Create 3 wrong options using:
   - Alternative interpretations from answer
   - Common misconceptions addressed in answer
   - Related but incorrect scenarios
   - Conditions that don't apply

VALIDATION - Each question must have:
✓ Clear, self-contained question text
✓ 4 content-specific options (NOT generic categories)
✓ Options that test understanding of THIS SPECIFIC ruling
✓ 1 correct answer derived from answer text
✓ 3 plausible wrong options from answer content
✓ 2-3 sentence explanation citing sources

GOLDEN RULE: Ask yourself "Do these options test if the user understood THIS SPECIFIC ruling, or just generic Islamic law categories?"
