      "title": "He divorced a woman by zihaar before the marriage contract was done with her, and he wants to marry her!",
      "question": "<p>There is a young man who is 29 years old. His family sent word to him that they had proposed marriage for him to a girl whom he knows. When the news reached him, he said: She is to me as my mother's back (zihaar), and she is thrice divorced, because he did not want her. When he went to his family, he found that they had not proposed marriage to the girl for him; it was only a suggestion. But in the end, this man was convinced about this girl and wanted to marry her, and he is asking what is the ruling on what he did? Does he have to offer expiation for the zihaar or not? What is the ruling on the threefold divorce that he uttered? Please note that when he said these two things, the marriage contract had not been done with the girl; rather it was only a suggestion from his family.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Before answering this question, I should advise this brother about this conduct and foolishness. The fact that he uttered the words of zihaar and divorced her three times, before the marriage contract was done and just because he was told that a proposal had been made to her on his behalf, is to be regarded as a sign of serious haste and foolishness. The wise and resolute person is the one who controls himself and does not do anything except that which leads to good consequences. How many people have been overcome by foolishness and anger and done things which they regret later on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what he did of zihaar and divorcing this woman with whom he had not done the marriage contract, it does not amount to anything, because divorce cannot happen except after the marriage contract, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them” [al-Ahzaab 33:49]. And because divorce is for the one who has the right of intimacy with a woman, and he did not have the right to intimacy until then and did not have a marriage&nbsp; contract; and because divorce is undoing the marriage contract, and so long as he has not got married, there is nothing to be undone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to zihaar, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who make unlawful to them (their wives) by Zihaar” [al-Mujaadilah 58:3]. So zihaar is connected to their wives, and so long as the marriage contract has not been done with a woman, she is not one of his wives, so zihaar cannot apply to her. But if this man intended by means of zihaar to refrain from having intercourse with her, then he must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen) if he had married her and had intercourse with her, so as to be on the safe side and so as to discharge any obligation. As for his zihaar, it is not binding, because she is not one of his wives. Expiation for breaking an oath is freeing a slave, or feeding ten poor persons, or clothing them. If he cannot do that, then he must fast for three consecutive days. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him).&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "The Best Time for Walimah",
      "question": "<p>I am going to get married, in sha Allah, and I want to follow the Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by offering a wedding feast (Walimah). My question is: when is the right time to do it? What is the number of people to be invited? Please note that in our country the invitation and offering food is done before the marriage contract is done.

But if that is not possible, then there is nothing wrong with doing it before the marriage is consummated, or when the marriage contract is done, or after that.</p>\n<p>The matter is broad in scope, but it is better to pay attention to what is usually done in your country, because there is no Shar`i text to indicate that it is obligatory or recommended to do it at a certain time.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Scholarly_Opinions_on_Walimah_Timing\">Scholarly Opinions on Walimah Timing</span></h3>\n<p>Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Salaf differed concerning the time (for the wedding feast): should it be at the time of the marriage contract, or after it, or just before the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/854\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consummation of the marriage</a> , or after that; it could be at any time from when the marriage contract is first done until after the marriage is consummated. There are several scholarly opinions.

(End quote from Subul As-Salam, 1/154)</p>\n<p>The Hadith of Anas was narrated by Al-Bukhari (4793) and Muslim (1428) as follows: When the day dawned the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was a bridegroom to Zaynab bint Jahsh, whom he married in Madinah, and he invited the people to eat in the forenoon.</p>\n<p>According to a version narrated by Al-Bukhari (5166): When the day dawned, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was a bridegroom to her, then he invited the people and they had some food.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The time and description of the Walimah in the Hadith of Zaynab indicate that it followed the consummation of the marriage. (End quote from Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-`Ilmiyyah, p. 346)</p>\n<p>Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Hadith of Anas clearly indicates that it came after consummation, because he said: “When the day dawned, he was a bridegroom to Zaynab and he invited the people …”</p>\n<p>Some of the Malikis regarded it as recommended for it to be just before consummation, which should come after it, and this is what people do nowadays. (End quote from Fat-h Al-Bari, 9/231)</p>\n<p>Al-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is better to say that the recommended time is flexible; it may be at any time from when the marriage contract is done until <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20066\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the end of the days of the wedding</a> .</p>\n<p>That is because there is a report to support that, and because joy is greatest after consummation. But the custom nowadays is to do it shortly before consummation. (End quote from Al-Insaf, 8/317)</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter on the duty to accept invitations to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/234117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wedding feasts</a> ; the one who gives a Walimah for seven days and the like; the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not specify that it should be for one or two days.</p>\n<p>Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., he did not set a specific time for the Walimah or say that it is obligatory or recommended; that may be understood from the general meaning of the Hadith.</p>\n<p>Ad-Damiri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The jurists did not set a specific time for the wedding feast, but the correct view is that it should be after the consummation of the marriage. The Shaykh (i.e., As-Subki) said: It is permissible to do it before or after; the matter is flexible and it may be done at any time after the marriage contract is done, as was stated by Al-Baghawi. (End quote from Al-Najm Al-Wahhaj, 7/393)</p>\n<p>Ibn Tulun (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The more correct view is that one should refer to what is customary. (End quote from Fass Al-Khawatim fima qila fil-Wala’im, p. 44)</p>\n<p>Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The time for giving the wedding feast is flexible, starting from the time of the marriage contract until the end of the days of the wedding.

There is no minimum number of people that must be invited. (End quote from Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari, 13/283)</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:</p>\n<p>The more you add (to the number of guests) at the wedding feast the better, because that helps to announce the marriage more widely and increases the supplications for blessing of one’s family and wealth.

      "question": "<p>If one does not perform the Tarawih prayer in the mosque for one or more days, does it fall under the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): \"Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven,\" or is it necessary to stand (in prayer) all the nights of Ramadan?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.\" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2009) and Muslim (759).</p>\n<p>The apparent meaning of the Hadith is that it refers to standing (in prayer) for the entire month of Ramadan, whether it is done in congregation in the mosque or at home. Thus, the ruling includes everyone who stands (in prayer) during Ramadan, whether in congregation or alone, in the mosque or at home.</p>\n<p>As-San`ani said:</p>\n<p>\"It is possible that it means standing (in prayer) for all its nights, and that whoever stands for part of it does not achieve the forgiveness mentioned, which is the apparent meaning.\" End quote from \"Subul As-Salam\" (4/182).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\"He (the Prophet) said: 'Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan' means the month of Ramadan, and it encompasses the whole month, from its beginning to its end.\" End quote from \"Sharh Bulugh Al-Maram\" (3/290).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in his \"Fatawa\" (24/9) with the numbering of Al-Shamilah:</p>\n<p>\"Standing (in prayer) during Ramadan is achieved by praying a portion of every night, like half or a third of it, whether that is by praying eleven Rak`ahs or twenty-three, and standing (in prayer) is achieved by praying behind the Imam of the neighborhood until he departs, even if it is for less than an hour...\" End quote.</p>\n<p>For those who miss standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan; if it was due to an excuse that prevented them from doing so, then this virtue mentioned in the Hadith is hoped for them; due to the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): \"When a servant falls ill or travels, it will be written for him as if he was doing the deeds he used to perform when he was healthy and resident.\" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2996).</p>\n<p>Al-Qastallani said:</p>\n<p>\"Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan\" all its nights, or some of them when he is unable to do so, and his intention was to pray if not for the obstacle.\" End quote from \"Irshad As-Sari\" (3/425).</p>\n<p>However, if one leaves standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan out of laziness, the apparent meaning of the Hadith is that he does not achieve the mentioned virtue.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is upon a Muslim to be keen on praying Tarawih in congregation in the mosque, and if he is unable or preoccupied, he should pray at home to the best of his ability.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) Mentioned in the Bible?",
      "question": "<p>What sort of references can I use to confirm that what GOD intended as regards His will, and that His will has been changed by Christian scribes/translators? Also, if you could tell me where in the Bible it speaks of the Prophet Muhammad, does it mention his name or it is symbolic?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And (remember) when ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawraat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmad, i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is plain magic’”&nbsp;[al-Saff 61:6]</p>\n<p>“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)— he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Quran) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful”&nbsp;[al-A’raaf 7:157]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These two verses indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel (the Bible), no matter how much the Jews and Christians claim that he is not, for the word of Allah is the best and most truthful of words.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the things mentioned in the previous Books are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – In the Torah, in the Book of Deuteronomy 18:18-19 it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.</p>\n<p>If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.”</p>\n<p>(New International Version)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This text is still extant among them. With regard to the phrase “from among their brothers” – if that prophet were to be from among the Children of Israel, it would have said, “I will raise up for them a prophet from among them.” But it says “from among their brothers” – i.e., from among the sons of Ismaa’eel (Ishamel).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly, it says in the Gospel of John 16:6-8, 12-13:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>“It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor [Paraclete] will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.&nbsp;</div>\n<p><sup>8</sup>When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin…</p>\n<p>I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.”</p>\n<p>(New International Version)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This cannot apply to anyone except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Secondly: Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It says in the Torah, in the fifth book [Deuteronomy 33:2]: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes [or: from his right hand went a fiery law for them].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(New International Version; alternative version of last phrase – the meaning of which is unclear in the original Hebrew texts – is from the King James Version)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This refers to the three Prophethoods: the Prophethood of Moosa (Moses), the Prophethood of ‘Eesa (Jesus) and the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). “Coming from Sinai” refers to the mountain where Allah spoke to Moosa and called him and told him he was a Prophet. “Dawning over them from Seir” refers to the appearance of the Messiah from Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). Seir is a village that is still known there to this day. So this was a foretelling of the Prophethood of the Messiah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Paran” refers to Makkah. Allah likens the Prophethood of Moosa to the coming of the dawn, and the Prophethood of the Messiah after him to the rising of the sun, and the Prophethood of the Seal of the Prophets to the sun rising high in the sky and its light reaching all over the earth. And it came to pass exactly as foretold, for Allah dispelled the night of disbelief with the Prophethood of Moosa, and the light increased with the Prophethood of the Messiah, and was completed and reached everywhere on earth with the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). These three Prophets who were mentioned in this foretelling were also mentioned in the beginning of Soorat al-Teen (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“By the fig, and the olive.</p>\n<p>By Mount Sinai.</p>\n<p>By this city of security (Makkah)”</p>\n<p>[al-Teen 95:1-3]</p>\n<p>End quote. See Hidaayat al-Hayaara, p. 110; and Ibn al-Qayyim’s comments on the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 33:1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Fourthly: Shaykh ‘Abd al-Majeed al-Zandaani said in his book al-Bishaaraat bi Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fi’l-Kutub al-Samawiyyah al-Saabiqah that in the 22</div>\n<p><sup>nd</sup> chapter of the Gospel of Barnabas it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And this will continue until there comes Muhammad the Messenger of God who, when he comes, will expose this deceit to those who believe in the laws of God.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And it says in the Book of Isaiah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I have made your name Muhammad O Muhammad, O beloved of the Lord, your name will abide forever.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And it says in the Book of Isaiah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What I have given to him I will not give to anyone else: Ahmad, because he praises God and this praise comes from the best part of the earth, and this will bring joy to mankind and they will recite the word of divine unity on every hill and glorify God in every high place.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many scholars have mentioned the places in the Bible where the name of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned. Sometimes his name is mentioned clearly, and sometimes he is described in ways that can only apply to him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should note that the books of the Bible as they exist today have been altered and changed. This fact has been stated by non-Muslim historians, but despite all that we still find in the Bible the foretelling of the coming of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Shaykh Rahmat-Allah al-Hindi stated that every time the Christians were able to change something they did so, hence you will find that some of the ancient scholars quote passages from the Bible that no longer exist. But there are still other passages that foretell the Prophethood of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his coming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that we have to arm ourselves with adequate sound knowledge in order to debate with the Christians, because even if they have no proof, they will still try to sow the seeds of doubt in people’s hearts so that they will give in to these wrong ideas and so that the truth will be concealed. “But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it)” [al-Saff 61:8 – interpretation of the meaning].</p>\n<p>Some of the most useful books on this topic are: Izhaar al-Haqq by Shaykh Rahmat-Allah al-Hindi; Kitaab Hidaayat al-Hayaara by Ibn Al-Qayyim; and al-Jawaab al-Saheeh by Ibn Taymiyyah. And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I travel a great deal. I travel far away from my children for a year or two, then I come back and stay with them for one month, then I travel again, and so on. All of this is for the sake of earning money and providing for my children. In recent years I noticed that their attitude has started to become bad, and I fear that they may go astray. <br />\n<br />\nWhat should I do?

      "answer": "<p>    You should note that Allaah has placed a trust on the     shoulders of every father, and a responsibility concerning which he will be     questioned on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible     for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The     man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. The     woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her     flock.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2409; Muslim, 1829.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The first thing that the father should pay attention to,     regarding his children, is their religious commitment and morals; this will     lead to their salvation in this world and in the Hereafter.

Ward off yourselves and your families     against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are     (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the     Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tahreem 66:6]</p>\n<p>    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: This means: teach them and     discipline them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And before the responsibility of earning money and spending     on them comes the greater responsibility of ensuring that they be saved in     the Hereafter from the punishment of Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are brilliant examples of men who fulfilled this trust     and did that which Allaah had enjoined upon them with regard to their wives     and children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is a man who wakes his wife up to pray during the last     third of the night, and at Fajr he wakes up his children and takes them to     the mosque and sits with them, remembering Allaah and reading Qur’aan until     the sun comes up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Another has the habit of taking his sons with him to the     mosque to perform the five daily obligatory prayers, and when they have     finished ‘Asr prayer he stays with them in the mosque, teaching them the     Qur’aan and how to memorize it and recite it properly (tajweed), and what it     means, then they all go home together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But unfortunately there are many fathers who do not do that     which Allaah has enjoined upon them of taking care of their family’s     religious commitment and all they care about is looking after their worldly     affairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some fathers who, if their child falls sick and his     temperature rises a little, they panic and go looking for a doctor and a     remedy, which is all well and good, and is an act of compassion towards the     child, but what is strange is that they do not care if their children commit     haraam (unlawful) actions, even major sins that may doom one to Hell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    How high is the temperature of Hell?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    How can they fear a slight rise of temperature in their     child, and not worry about the fire of Hell?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some fathers who, if their child is falling behind     in his studies and not keeping up with their classmates, go crazy and lose     sleep, and worry a great deal until they bring a tutor who can help the     child advance in his studies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the children neglect their prayers or do something     haraam, or commit a major sin, they do not blame them in that case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some fathers get very angry if their child transgresses one     of their rights or ignores one of their commands, but they do not care if     the child transgresses one of the rights of Allaah or disobeys one of His     commands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a father neglects his children and does not teach them the     Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger and does not raise them     according to the basic tenets of faith and Islamic behaviour, undoubtedly     his children will go astray and will go out into society as weak and deviant     personalities, and the first ones to suffer from their corruption and     deviance will be this father and this mother who fell short in raising their     children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Hence our advice to you, if you think that your travelling     and being far away from your children will affect their upbringing and cause     them to go astray, is to go back to them and try to raise them properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What will it benefit you or your children if you amass wealth     for them but they become deviant and corrupt?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you look around you, you will see many examples of men who     travelled and left their children behind, and who suffered alienation and     loneliness for the sake of amassing wealth for their children, then they     came back with the money, but they lost something that is more important     than wealth, they lost their children, because the children went astray as a     result of their father’s absence and their mother’s negligence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The children do not appreciate what their fathers did for     their sake, and they take the money and start to curse them and mistreat them,     and even hit them sometimes, so the fathers regret deeply the fact that they     travelled and were so far away from their children… but what good is regret     when so much time has passed?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him)     was asked about the heads of families travelling. He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the heads of families travelling, if their     travel will cause harm to their families, then they should not travel,     because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “It is sufficient sin for a man that he should neglect those who are     dependent on him.” Classed as hasan (sound) by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood,     1692.&nbsp; Whether they will be harmed because of little maintenance or because of     their weakness, it is haraam (impermissible) for such a person to travel. If they will not     be harmed, but they will feel sad and will miss him, then if there is no     real benefit in travelling which brings a greater reward than his staying     with them, such as knowledge which he fears he will miss out on or a     knowledgeable person he has to meet with, then it is better for him to stay     with them. But if it is like the travel of many people, which is just for     the purpose of leisure and filling time, then it is better for him to stay     and worship Allaah at home in all cases. The person who is in this situation     should consult a knowledgeable person who knows him and what is best for him     and who is trustworthy, because people’s situations vary greatly with regard     to such matters. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/28.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to guide you and to help you to do that which     is best for you and your children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Reward for Doing Umrah for Others",
      "question": "<p>Allah blessed me and enabled me to do `umrah twice this year. The first was in Sha`ban and the second was in Ramadan. But the second time I did it on behalf of my deceased father. Will the reward of `umrah in Ramadan be recorded for me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed as to whether the one who does Hajj or `Umrah on behalf of another person will have the same reward as the one on whose behalf it is done. There are two views:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first view is that the proxy will have a reward like that of the one on whose behalf he does it, so both of them are included in the virtue mentioned in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him” and “ `Umrah during it – i.e., Ramadan – is equivalent to Hajj.”&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those who held this view quoted as evidence the general meaning of the Hadiths quoted above. They also noted that if “the one who tells others of some good deed will have a reward like that of the one who does it,” as is mentioned in the authentic Hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then it is more appropriate that the one who does an action on behalf of someone else should also receive the reward in full.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It was narrated from Dawud that he said: I said to Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab: O Abu Muhammad, who will have the reward, the one who performs Hajj or the one on whose behalf he performs Hajj? Sa`id said: Allah, may He be exalted, so generous that He will reward both abundantly. Ibn Hazm said: Sa`id (may Allah have mercy on him) is right.” (Al-Muhalla, 7/61)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Ash-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The one who does Hajj on behalf of the deceased will have the reward of Hajj if he did that voluntarily (without being paid for it). Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Masa’il Al-Imam Ahmad, narrating from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him): I heard a man say to Ahmad: I want to do Hajj on behalf of my mother; do you think that I will also have the reward of Hajj? He said: Yes, because you are paying a debt that she owes. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the apparent meaning of what was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does Hajj on behalf of one who has died, the one who does it will have a reward like that of the one on whose behalf he did Hajj. Whoever gives food to one who is fasting with which to break his fast will have a reward like his, and whoever calls others to do some good deed will have a reward like that of the one who does it.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Ash-Shaykh (5/184)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) classed the following Hadith as inauthentic “Whoever does Hajj on behalf of one who has died, the one who does it will have a reward like that of the one on whose behalf he did Hajj”&nbsp; &nbsp; (Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da`ifah wal Mawdu`ah)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second view is that the virtue or reward mentioned in the Hadiths quoted above applies only to the one on whose behalf it is done; as for the proxy, he will have a reward for his kindness towards his brother in performing the ritual on his behalf, and for whatever acts of worship he does separately from the actions of Hajj, and that he does in the Haram, such as prayer, Dhikr and so on.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (11/77-78) it says: “Whoever does Hajj or `Umrah on behalf of another person, whether that is in return for payment or otherwise, the reward of Hajj or `Umrah will go to the person on whose behalf he did it, and there is the hope that he will also have a great reward, commensurate with his sincerity and intention to do good.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Will the one who does Hajj on behalf of another person attain the reward mentioned by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him”?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The answer to this question depends on whether this man is doing Hajj on his own behalf or on behalf of someone else. If he is doing Hajj&nbsp; on behalf of someone else and has not yet done Hajj on his own behalf, then he will not attain the reward mentioned by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he is only doing Hajj on behalf of someone else. But in sha Allah, if he intends to benefit his brother and meet his need, then Allah, may He be Exalted, will reward him.” ( Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 21/34)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: “The reward for deeds having to do with the rituals of Hajj all goes to the one who appointed him as his proxy; as for multiplying the reward for prayers and tawaf that he does voluntarily outside of the rituals of Hajj, and reading Quran, that will go to the one who is doing Hajj and not to the one who appointed him to do it on his behalf.” (Ad-Diya’ Al-Lami` min Al-Khutab wal Jawami`,&nbsp; 2/478)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This issue is one concerning which there is a difference of opinion among the scholars, and the texts concerning it are not quite clear. So to be on the safe side we should say that the issue of reward is something that Allah will decide. The Fatwa Committee issued other fatwas concerning this matter and said: With regard to a man performing Hajj on behalf of another person, and whether that is like his performing Hajj on his own behalf, or is less or more than that in terms of virtue (and reward), that is something that Allah, may He be glorified, will decide.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 11/100)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/65641\" target=\"_blank\">65641</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111407\" target=\"_blank\">111407</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/142234\" target=\"_blank\">142234</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/103849\" target=\"_blank\">103849</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/79681\" target=\"_blank\">79681</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>      We have not       found anything in the saheeh Sunnah or the reports from the Sahaabah and       Taabi‘een to indicate that an easy pregnancy is one of the signs of       special mercy from Allah, may He be exalted, to a woman. That is one of       the matters of the unseen regarding which we must adhere to what is       mentioned in the texts and reports, and not attribute any such thing to       the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) unless we are       certain of it and that it is saheeh. Allah, may He be glorified and       exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And     follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of     which you have no knowledge (e.g. ones saying: \"I have seen,\" while in fact     he has not seen, or \"I have heard,\" while he has not heard). Verily! The     hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be     questioned (by Allah)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’     17:36].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the     mercy of Allah, may He be exalted, may be in wellbeing, but it may also be     in trials and tests, according to the knowledge and wisdom of Allah, may He     be glorified and exalted. It was narrated from Muhammad ibn Khaalid, from     his father, from his grandfather – who was a companion of the Messenger of     Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – that he said: I heard the     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If a     certain status has previously been decreed by Allah for a person, and he     does not attain it by his deeds, Allah afflicts him in his body or wealth or     children.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by     Abu Dawood in as-Sunan, no. 3090. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.     This hadeeth indicates that if a woman is tested with difficulty and     hardship in pregnancy, that may be a sign of Allah’s mercy towards the woman     and of what she will have with Allah of reward and great status, especially     if we remember the hadeeth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be     upon him) in which he said:         “There is no calamity that befalls a Muslim but he is expiated thereby, even     a thorn that pricks him.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by     al-Bukhaari (5640) and Muslim (2572).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thus it is     clear that whoever wants to attain the mercy of Allah, may He be exalted,     let him be patient at the time of calamity and let him be grateful at the     time of blessing, for in that case he will be in a very good state and will     not be distracted by thinking about what Allah, may He be exalted, intends     by this calamity, for that is one of the matters of the unseen of which he     has no knowledge, but by being grateful and showing patience, he will attain     the mercy and good pleasure of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sufyaan     ath-Thawri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no     one who understands Islam but he regards calamity as a blessing, and ease as     a calamity. </p>\n<p>    End quote from    Hilyat al-Awliya’ (7/55).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    One of the     earlier generations said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Be content     with Allah in all that He does to you, for He does not withhold from you     except in order to give you, and He does not put you through trials except     in order to bring about your well-being, and He does not cause you to be     sick except in order to heal you, and He does not cause you to die except in     order to bring you back to life. So beware of failing to be content with Him     even for a moment, lest you be deprived of mercy.</p>\n<p>    End quote from    Madaarij as-Saalikeen, 2/216&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if there     is some symptom of illness that prevents you from having another child, that     does not indicate that you are a bad woman or that you have been cast away     from the mercy of Allah – Allah forbid. Rather that is a common occurrence     and there is no blame on you.     “and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any     hardship”[al-Hajj 22:78].     But we also think that the difficulty and hardship that you are facing at     present mean that this is not an appropriate time to take such a decision.     How many women have thought in such situations the same as you are thinking     now, but when Allah made the birth easy for her and she had rested for a     while after that hardship, she once again began to long for pregnancy and     childbirth, and to raise little ones. Perhaps if Allah makes the birth easy     for you – in sha Allah – and you rest for a while after that, maybe Allah     will help you with another pregnancy.
