      "title": "Conditions of Worship in Islam",
      "question": "<p>What are the conditions of worship in Islam?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“Firstly: the worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its reasons. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/4524\" target=\"_blank\">Any person who worships Allah</a> by doing an <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147608\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> that is not done for a reason proven in Shari`ah is doing an act of worship that will be rejected and is not enjoined by Allah and His Messenger.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An example of that is celebrating the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or celebrating the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, claiming that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on that night. This is not in accordance with Shari`ah so it is to be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no historical proof that the Mi'raj (ascent into heaven) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took place on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. The books of hadith that we have do not contain even a single letter that indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. It is known that this is the kind of information that cannot be accepted without sound isnads.</li>\n<li>Even if it were proven, do we have the right to innovate some kinds of worship on that date or to make it a festival? Not at all. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and saw that the Ansar had two days on which they would play, he said: “Allah has replaced these for you with something better,” and he mentioned to them ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha. This indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked any festival to be innovated in Islam apart from the Islamic festivals, of which there are three: the two annual ‘Eids, which are ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha, and the weekly festival which is Friday. Even if it were proven that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh of Rajab – which it is impossible to prove – we cannot innovate anything on that occasion without the permission of the Lawgiver.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I have said to you, bid’ah (innovation) is a serious matter which has a bad effect on the heart even if a person feels softness in his heart at that moment. For the matter will subsequently be the opposite, because if the heart rejoices in falsehood, that joy will not last, rather it will be followed by pain and regret. Every bid’ah is serious because it implies criticism of the Messenger, because this bid’ah implies that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not bring the complete Shari`ah, even though Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”&nbsp;[Al-Maidah 5:3]</p>\n<p>It is strange that you find some of those who indulge in these innovations strongly urge people to follow them, but they are negligent about matters which are more beneficial, more sound and more useful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence we say that celebrating the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab as the night in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven is a bid’ah, because it is based on something that is not mentioned in Shari`ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"2\">Secondly: the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/221178\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> should be in accordance with Shari`ah in its type or nature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if a person were to sacrifice a horse, that would be contrary to the Shari`ah in the nature of the action. Because a sacrifice can only involve an animal of the an'am class, namely a camel, a cow or a sheep.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\">Thirdly: the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/113177\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its amount. If someone were to say that he was going to pray Zuhr as six rak'ahs, would this act of worship be in accordance with Shari`ah? Not at all, because it is not in accordance with it in terms of the amount or number. If someone were to say Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah), al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty-five times following a prescribed prayer, would this be correct? The answer is that if your aim is to worship Allah by saying it this number of times because you believe this is the proper way, then you are mistaken. If you deliberately add something to what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has prescribed, but you believe that the proper way prescribed in Islam is thirty-three, then the extras are fine, because you are not suggesting that the higher number is the proper way that is prescribed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li value=\"4\">Fourthly: The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/310759\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> must be in accordance with Shari`ah in how it is done.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a person does an act of worship that is acceptable in its type, amount and reason, but he goes against Shari`ah in the manner in which he does it, then it is not valid. For example, a man breaks wind etc. and does wudu, but he washes his feet and then wipes his head, then washes his hands, then washes his face – is his wudu valid? Not at all, because he has gone against Shari`ah in the way in which he did it.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"5\">Fifthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/210742\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> with regard to its timing.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if a person fasts Ramadan in Sha’ban, or in Shawwal, or he prays Zuhr before the sun has passed its zenith, or after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it – because if he prays before the sun has passed its zenith he is praying before the time has come, and if he prays after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it he is praying after the time has gone –his prayer is not valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence we say that if a person deliberately does not pray until the time for that prayer is over, with no valid excuse, his prayer will not be accepted even if he prays a thousand times. Hence we follow an important principle in this regard which is that in the case of every act of worship that is to be done at a certain time, if a person does it outside of the proper time with no valid excuse, it will not be accepted, rather it will be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The evidence for that is the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"6\">Sixthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a person stands in Muzdalifah on the day of ‘Arafah, this standing is not valid, because the act of worship is not in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. Similarly, for example, if a person were to do i'tikaf in his own house, that would not be valid, because the place of i'tikaf is the mosque. Hence it is not valid for a woman to do i'tikaf in her house, because this is not the place for i’tikaf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some of his wives had set up tents in the mosque; he told them to take them down and not to do i’tikaf, but he did not tell them to do i'tikaf in their houses. This indicates that the women should not do i'tikaf in their houses because that goes against Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So with regard to these six factors, an act of worship is not regarded as following <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/282538\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> unless it combines all six:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reason</li>\n<li>Type</li>\n<li>Amount</li>\n<li>Manner</li>\n<li>Time</li>\n<li>Place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>When I am praying, so that I will not forget how many rak‘ahs I have prayed, I count the number of rak‘ahs on my fingers. When I have prayed one rak‘ah, I clench one of my fingers, then when I pray a second rak‘ah I clench the second finger, and so on until the end of the prayer. Is that permissible or is it regarded as making too many movements which invalidate or spoil the prayer?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is nothing wrong with that, because it is a small movement and is nothing big. There is nothing wrong with clenching one or two fingers so as not to forget, and this is not moving too much. Rather it is something small that is in the interests of the prayer, so it is excused.

      "title": "Appointing someone else to take over as imam during the prayer",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to change imams during the prayer, starting from the second rak’ah, because the imam cannot complete the prayer or the recitation of Qur’aan because he is crying so much and he is afraid that he may make the prayer too long for those who are praying behind him, and they are on a journey or are in a hurry, so he appoints someone from the congregation to take over leading the prayer during the prayer, and they trade places and complete the prayer from that point? If what they did is not permissible what should the imam do? What should those who were praying behind him do? What should the replacement imam do?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a reason arises which prevents the imam from completing     the prayer or from continuing as the imam, he may appoint someone to take     over for him and complete the prayer with the congregation. This is the view     of the majority of te scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Majmoo’ (4/142):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn al-Mundhir narrated it from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali,     ‘Ilqimah, ‘Ata’, al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Nakha’i, al-Thawri, Maalik, ashaab     al-ra’i and Ahmad, and he did not narrate from anyone that it is not     permitted to appoint someone else to take over. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They quoted as evidence the fact that when ‘Umar ibn     al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) was stabbed as he was praying,     he took the hand of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf and made him move forward, and     he led the people in the remainder of the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari,     3700.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That was done in the presence of the Sahaabah and others, and     no one objected, so there was consensus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (3/252)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the imam becomes unable to complete the prayer or to do     any of the essential parts of the prayer, that is regarded as one of the     excuses which make it permissible for him to appoint someone else to     complete the congregational prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Abu’l-Waleed al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’     (1/290):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the imam moving back because of an excuse,     there is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that this is     permissible. The excuses are of two types:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That includes something that makes the imam obliged to become     a member of the congregation, which is if he becomes unable to do any of the     obligatory parts of the prayer. In that case he should move back and make     another man move forward to complete the prayer and he should follow the new     imam. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Another example is if the imam is overcome with weeping and     he cannot complete the recitation of al-Faatihah, which is an essential part     of the prayer. In that case he should appoint a member of the congregation     to take over. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/944):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If he is unable to complete al-Faatihah, then he may appoint     someone to take over leading them in prayer, because he has become unable to     do it. And it is permissible to appoint someone else, such as if he breaks     his wudoo’ by accident or if he becomes unable during the prayer to do an     essential part of the prayer, then he may appoint someone to complete the     prayer. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam has finished reciting al-Faatihah, then he is     overcome with weeping whilst reciting Qur’aan after al-Faatihah, in that     case he may stop reciting and bow, and he does not have to do anything     else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib (may Allaah be     pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) led us in praying Fajr in Makkah, and he started to     recite Soorat al-Mu’minoon, until he came to the passage that mentions Moosa     and Haroon, when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) was overcome by coughing, so he bowed. Narrated by Muslim (455).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh     Muslim (4/177):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This hadeeth shows that it is permissible to stop reciting     and it is not makrooh to do so, if one stops for a reason. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible for him to appoint someone else to take     over in that case, because he is able to complete the prayer with the     people, doing only the essential parts of the prayer. There is no need for     him to continue reciting with difficulty when weeping, because reciting     something else in addition to al-Faatihah is not obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Mawaahib al-Jaleel (2/136) it is narrated that     al-Maaziri said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He should not appoint someone to take over if he is prevented     from reciting part of the soorah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In such cases it is recommended that he try to control     himself as much as he can, so that he will not cause any hardship to the     other worshippers if his weeping goes on for too long, as that will have     some negative effects. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked in    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (11/342): What is your opinion on the phenomenon     of weeping loudly?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I have advised many of those who have gotten in touch with me     to avoid doing this and that it is not appropriate, because it annoys people     and causes hardship to them, and it distracts other worshippers and those     who are reading Qur’aan. What the believer should do is strive not to let     his voice be heard if he is weeping, and he should beware of showing off,     for the shaytaan may lead him to show off. He should not annoy anyone with     his voice, or disturb them. But it is known that some people do not do that     by choice, rather they get overwhelmed without meaning to. In this case it     is forgivable if he cannot help it. It is proven that when the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited Qur’aan, his chest would     heave like the boiling of a cauldron because of weeping. And it is narrated     that when Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) read Qur’aan, he could     not make the people hear it because of weeping. And it is narrated that     ‘Umar’s sobs could be heard from behind the rows (of worshippers). But this     does not mean that the voice should be raised in weeping, rather it is     something that overwhelmed them because of their fear of Allaah. So if a     person is overcome with weeping and cannot help it, there is no sin on him     for that. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From the above it is clear that if your imam had finished     reciting al-Faatihah, then he made a mistake when he appointed someone else     to take over, and he should not do that again. But the ruling on your prayer     and his is that the prayer is valid, in sha Allaah, and no one should be     told to repeat it, because you were all unaware of this ruling. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam is overcome with weeping whilst reciting     al-Faatihah, then what he did by appointing someone else to take over was     correct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The prostration of everything in the universe to Allaah",
      "question": "<p>It says in Soorat al-Hajj 22:18 that the dawaab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.) prostrate to Allaah. What is the nature of this prostration?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Note that this universe and all the created beings in it is     in thrall to Allaah, whether by choice or by force. The believer worships     Allaah by choice and is rewarded for his worship. Even though the kaafir may     be alienated from his Lord and failing to worship Him, the atoms of his body     and everything in him is worshipping Him and glorifying Him, but because our     understanding and perception are limited, we are unaware of that tasbeeh     (glorification of Allaah) and unable to understand its nature. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein,     glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you     understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing,     Oft-Forgiving”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:44]</p>\n<p>What this means is that     every created being is in a state of submission to Allaah and worships Him     in a manner appropriate to its situation. The sun, moon, stars, trees and     animals are all in a state of subjugation to Allaah and prostrate to Him,     and all of them worship Him in an appropriate manner. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“See you not that     whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the     moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawaabb     [moving (living) creatures, beasts], and many of mankind prostrate     themselves to Allaah. But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is     justified. And whomsoever Allaah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily,     Allaah does what He wills”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:18]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Have they not     observed things that Allaah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the     right and to the left, making prostration unto Allaah, and they are lowly?</p>\n<p>And to Allaah     prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the     moving (living) creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they     worship their Lord (Allaah) with humility]”</p>\n<p>[al-Nahl 16:48-49]</p>\n<p>    Imaam Ibn Katheer said: Allaah is telling us of His Might,     Majesty and Pride, for everything submits to Him and all things and     creatures humble themselves before Him, inanimate objects and animals, and     those which are accountable among mankind and the jinn, and the angels.     Allaah tells us that everything that has a shadow that inclines towards the     right and towards the left – i.e., morning and evening – prostrates to     Allaah. Mujaahid said: When the sun passes its zenith everything prostrates     to Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has confirmed that all beings prostrate to Him, and He     has explained how some of them prostrate, which is by the inclining of its     shadow towards the right and the left. It does not mean that everything     prostrates on seven parts of the body; that applies only to the Muslims. The     prostration of all other beings is in accordance with their nature. The fact     that this prostration is prostration in the real sense is indicated by the     apparent meaning of the text, because there is no valid reason for not     interpreting the text as it appears to be, so we must accept it. That is     also supported by the fact that the prostration of the sun, moon, stars,     trees and animals is mentioned in conjunction with the prostration of the     angels and humans, which indicates that this is prostration in a real sense     for all the entities mentioned. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah     have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Prostration is a form of humility, so the prostration which     includes all creatures implies the utmost submission and humility. For every     created thing submits to His greatness and humbles itself before His might     and power. This does not mean that everything prostrates like human beings     do, on seven parts of the body, putting the forehead on the ground. This     kind of prostration is only for human beings. Some other nations bow but do     not prostrate, and that is their prostration. Allaah says (interpretation of     the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with     humility) and say: “Forgive us”’</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:58]</p>\n<p>It was said that this     means enter it bowing, and some of them prostrate on their sides like the     Jews. Sujood (prostration) is a generic term but because the way in which     Muslims prostrate is so well known, many people think that this is how     everything prostrates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Jaami’ al-Rasaa’il, 1/27&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is known that     everything prostrates according to its nature, and the prostration of these     created entities does not mean that they put their foreheads on the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/284&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This prostration includes the submission and humbling of     these created entities to Allaah and their surrendering to His Lordship,     Might and Sovereignty. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is the prostration of     humility and submission, for everything submits to His Lordship, humbles     itself before His Might and is subject to His Sovereignty.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/107&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The prostration of these created entities is a prostration in     a real sense as befits each of these entities. So man prostrates in the     manner that suits him, in the manner that is well known, on seven parts of     the body. The sun prostrates in the manner that suits it, as mentioned in     the saheeh hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said:     “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu     Dharr when the sun had set, ‘Do you know where it went?’ I said, ‘Allaah and     His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘It has gone to prostrate beneath the     Throne, then it asks for permission to rise, but soon it will prostrate and     its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask for permission to rise     and that will not be granted to it, and it will be said to it, “Go back from     whence you came,” and it will rise from the west. This is what Allaah says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term     (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing”</p>\n<p>    [Yaa-Seen 36:38].’”</p>\n<p>    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3199)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So it prostrates in a real sense, as is suited to the sun,     but how does it prostrate to Allaah beneath the Throne? Allaah knows best     how this prostration happens. The apparent meaning of the hadeeth proves     that what this prostration means is not simply submission to the command of     Allaah and obedience to Him. Indeed, it is submission, humility and     surrender by prostrating in a real sense, but we do not understand how it     happens. Similarly it is said that the moon, the trees, the animals and all     other entities prostrate in a manner that suits them. What the believer     should do is not to let the fact that he does not know how some entities     prostrate prevent him from believing in this prostration, rather he must     believe in what Allaah has told him about other entities prostrating to Him.</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Commiting Sin with Fiancee",
      "question": "<p>Approximately one year ago I got married to a righteous young man, and now we have done the marriage contract.</p>\n<p>But before the contract he used to hold my hand and kiss me. I know that it is haram (impermissible) according to sharee’ah (Islamic law). Will Allah forgive me now that we have done the marriage contract or does the sin remain and do I have to ask for forgiveness and offer expiation?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Many people use the word “engagement” to refer to the period following the marriage contract and before consummation of the marriage. If this is what is referred to in the question, then there is no sin on you for what happened between you, because simply by doing the marriage contract, the woman becomes the wife of the man and there is no sin on either of them for enjoying the other.</p>\n<p>But if what you mean by engagement is simply promising to get married and agreeing to do so without doing the marriage contract, then what happened between you is haram. During this period Islam does not permit anything more than looking so that both the man and woman can be sure that they want to go ahead and get engaged.

      "answer": "<p>These words are innovated. There is no doubt that there is no god but Allah and that nothing will abide forever except Allah, but the fact that it is said in this manner as described in the question is bid’ah, because every way of drawing close to Allah or of worshipping Allah that was not done by the salaf (early generations of Islam) is an innovation (bid’ah). Similarly, saying “Yaa Rahmaan, yaa Rahmaan” at the time of burial is also an innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sunnah for the one who follows a funeral procession is to ponder and think about his fate and that he is now walking behind the bier, but one day he will be the one whose bier is being followed as this bier is being followed, so he should ponder his own deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the time of burial, when the burial of the deceased was finished, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would stand at the graveside and say: “Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask for him to be made steadfast, for now he is being questioned.” This is what is prescribed in Islam.

      "title": "Ruling on receiving vaccines and antidotes extracted from the venom of scorpions, snakes and so on",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to make an antidote to scorpion stings from the venom of the scorpion itself? In general, is it permissible to give antidote is extracted from the venom or secretions of animals, or from the animal itself, such as its body?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>What is known in the world of medicine is that the British doctor Edward Jenner (1749-1823 CE) was the one who discovered vaccination – or inoculation – as a means of preventing smallpox. The author Paul Vallely said in an article entitled “How Islamic inventors changed the world” that inoculation was known to the Muslims before others, as he said: “The technique of inoculation was not invented by Jenner and Pasteur but was devised in the Muslim world and brought to Europe from Turkey by the wife of the English ambassador to Istanbul in 1724 CE.”</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars disallowed seeking treatment before becoming ill, but their view is not correct.</p>\n<p>Shaykh `Abd al-`Aziz ar-Rajihi (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>The ruling on giving vaccinations before disease occurs is that it is permissible, such as giving vaccines for meningitis and cholera. The evidence that that is permissible includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is soundly narrated in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats seven dates of Madinah in the morning, no witchcraft or poison will harm him.” So this hadith clearly refers to protection against disease before it happens, and it comes under the heading of taking permissible measures to ward off harm.</li>\n<li>The scholars are unanimously agreed that food and drink protect against the harm of hunger and thirst, and wearing thick clothing and woollen garments protects against the harm of cold, and the mujahid’s wearing armour and taking up weapons protects against the harm of the enemy. All of this comes under the heading of protecting oneself against ill health before it occurs, and all people are agreed on that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fawa’id fil-`Aqidah</em>, 18.</p>\n<p>See also the words of Shaykh `Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) in the answer to question no. 20276.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>With regard to the ruling on consuming poison, we should differentiate between taking poison and using it for medicinal purposes. Previously the scholars disagreed on the ruling concerning that in terms of whether it is impure (najis) or pure (tahir). The correct view is that it is pure, but it is not permissible to consume poison with the aim of committing suicide. There is a warning against doing that in a clear, authentic text.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be in the Fire of Hell, throwing himself down therein for ever and ever. Whoever takes poison and kills himself, his poison will be in his hand and he will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that piece of iron will be in his hand and he will be stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5442; Muslim, 109).</p>\n<p>As for the ruling on using poison for medicinal treatment, it is permissible if it is proven to be of benefit, but it should be prescribed by a skilled doctor. In the past, they used to use it for kings to protect them, so that poison would have no effect on them if someone wanted to kill them with it. It has also proven to be effective for those who live in the wilderness or in lands where snakes and scorpions are common.</p>\n<p>Imam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to taking medicine in which there is some venom or poison that is usually safe to take, there is no sin on the one who consumes it, because he is not consuming it in order to harm himself or to intoxicate himself, even if it happens to cause some kind of intoxication.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Umm</em>, 1/88.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah said:</p>\n<p>With regard to medicines that contain venom or poison, if using them will most likely lead to death or insanity, it is not permissible to consume them, but if the medicine is most likely to be safe and there is the hope of benefitting from it, then the view that it is permissible is the right view, as is the case with other medicines.</p>\n<p>But it may be that it is not permissible, because he is exposing himself to the risk of death, so it is not permissible, just as it is not permissible for one who consumes it without intending it as medicinal treatment.</p>\n<p>But the first view is more correct, because with many medicines there is some fear of harm [side effects], but it is permissible to use them in order to ward off greater harm. So if we say that it is prohibited to consume it, then it comes under the category of prohibited things like alcohol and so on, but if we say that it is permissible, then it comes under the category of permissible medications, like any other medicine.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Mughni</em>, 1/447.</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar al-`Asqallani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to simply taking poison, it is not prohibited in all cases, because it may be permissible to use a small amount of it, when it is mixed with something else that reduces its harm, if there is some benefit in that.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fat-h al-Bari</em>, 10/248.</p>\n<p>Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to use poison or venom for medicinal purposes, but it is not permissible to consume it otherwise. End quote from <em>Tafsir al-Qurtubi</em>, 2/220.</p>\n<p>In <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em>, 25/257, it says:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to use poison or venom for medicinal purposes, even according to those who say that it is impure, provided that it can be used in a safe way and there is the hope that it will be beneficial, by way of &nbsp;choosing the less harmful of two options and warding off the greater harm, on condition that you seek the advice of a Muslim doctor of good character, or you have good knowledge of what can be used for medicinal purposes, and there is no alternative that could treat the problem. End quote.</p>\n<p>The same applies to all other vaccines and antidotes. All of that is on condition that it should be prescribed by a skilled doctor, in the light of experiments that led to certain results, or almost certain results, and on condition that no harm will result from taking it, and whatever temporary negative consequences (side effects) occur, such as fever and so on, are negligible in comparison to the great benefit of that vaccination or antidote. We have discussed this in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20276\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20276</a>.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference whether the source of the vaccination or antidote is the same venomous animal, such as scorpions or snakes, or any other animals. What matters is that it is proven to be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar ash-Shinqiti (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) mentioned using venom or poison for protection, as some doctors used to administer it to great leaders if they feared that they could be poisoned. So they used to give them a few doses of the poison, so that the body would become able to handle it, and the scholars used to give concessions allowing that, because the reason for the prohibition is fear of dying from the poison, so if the reason is no longer there, the ruling is no longer applicable. Based on that, if it will no longer cause harm, or it is thought most likely that it will not cause harm, then it is permissible to administer it.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni`, Kitab al-At`imah</em>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it Sunnah to do ghusl on the Day of ‘Arafah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;It is not stipulated that one should be in a state of purity for the standing in ‘Arafah. The scholars are agreed that it is valid for a woman who is menstruating or a person who is in a state of janaabah to stand in ‘Arafah. However it is mustahabb (recommended) for the one who stands in ‘Arafah to be free of impurity, both major and minor, because he is going to be mentioning the name of Allah, may He be exalted, and it is mustahabb to do wudoo’ before mentioning the name of Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82029\" target=\"_blank\">82029</a> .</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;It is proven from more than one of the Sahaabah that they did ghusl for the day of ‘Arafah – such as Ibn Mas‘ood, Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them).</p>\n<p>Al-Bayhaqi (6124) narrated that Zaadhaan said: A man asked ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) about bathing. He said: Bathe every day if you wish. He said: No, (I mean) ghusl (in the sense of purification). He said: On Fridays, the day of ‘Arafah, the Day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) and the day of (Eid) al-Fitr.</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’ (1/177).</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (45/323)</p>\n<p>The Shaafa‘is, Hanbalis and Maalikis – according to one opinion – are of the&nbsp; view that it is Sunnah to do ghusl for the standing in ‘Arafah, because of the report narrated from ‘Ali, Ibn Mas‘ood and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), that they used to do ghusl when they went to ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is an act of worship for which people gather in one place, so it is prescribed to do ghusl for it, as in the case of Jumu‘ah and Eid prayers.</p>\n<p>The Hanafis and the Maalikis, according to the official opinion, are of the view that doing ghusl for the day of ‘Arafah is mustahabb. End quote.</p>\n<p>According to the fuqaha’, mustahabb refers to an unconfirmed Sunnah (Sunnah ghayr mu’akkadah), i.e., something that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do as a consistent practice.</p>\n<p>See: Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen (2/411)</p>\n<p>Thus it becomes clear that the four madhhabs are agreed that it is prescribed to do ghusl on the day of ‘Arafah, and that the one who does it will be rewarded. The evidence for it being prescribed is the action of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them).</p>\n<p>Ibn Maajah (1316) narrated from al-Faakih ibn Sa‘d that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do ghusl on the day of (Eid) al-Fitr, the Day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) and the day of ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>But this is a mawdoo‘ (fabricated) hadith, as stated by al-Albaani in Da‘eef Ibn Maajah.</p>\n<p>It was also narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Ghusl on these days is obligatory: Friday, the day of (Eid) al-Fitr, the Day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) and the day of ‘Arafah.” But this was classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in Da‘eef al-Jaami‘ (3929)</p>\n<p>In fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/81949\" target=\"_blank\">81949</a> we stated that it is mustahabb for the one who wants to gather with the people to do ghusl, clean himself and put on perfume. That includes ghusl for the standing in ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;It should be understood that doing ghusl for the day of ‘Arafah is not for every Muslim; rather it is only for the pilgrim, because this is what is narrated from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and because it is bathing for the purpose of gathering with people, and the gathering only takes place in ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>There is no report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from his companions of any ghusl in Hajj except three: ghusl when entering ihram, ghusl when entering Makkah, and ghusl on the day of ‘Arafah. End quote.&nbsp;Mamoo‘ al-Fataawa (26/132)</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;The words Sunnah and mustahabb are two words with one meaning, according to the terminology of the fuqaha’.</p>\n<p>Some of them differentiate between them.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What is mustahabb is what is masnoon (Sunnah), which is what is enjoined, but not by way of making it binding to do it, because if it was enjoined by way of making it binding to do it, it would be waajib (obligatory).</p>\n<p>The ruling on that which is mustahabb is that the one who does it in compliance with what is prescribed will be rewarded, but the one who does not do it will not be punished. However the reward for doing that which is mustahabb or masnoon is less than the reward for doing that which is obligatory, on the basis of textual and rational evidence.</p>\n<p>With regard to the textual evidence, it is the words of Allah, may He be exalted, in the hadith qudsi: “My slave does not draw closer to Me by means of anything dearer to Me than that which I have made obligatory upon him.” So an obligatory prayer of two rak‘ahs is dearer to Allah than a voluntary (naafil) prayer of two rak‘ahs.</p>\n<p>With regard to the rational evidence, the fact that Allah has made obligatory actions obligatory indicates that they are more emphatically prescribed, and that the accountable person needs to do them more than he needs to do the voluntary (naafil) actions.</p>\n<p>Is there a difference between mustahabb and masnoon?</p>\n<p>The answer is that some of the scholars differentiated between them by stating that mustahabb refers to that which is proven by analogy (qiyaas) and masnoon refers to that which is proven by a Sunnah, i.e., by evidence.</p>\n<p>But the correct view is that there is no difference between them, and the matter is one of terminology. According to the Hanbalis there is no difference between them, so it makes no difference whether we say “It is mustahabb to wash each part three times when doing wudoo’” or “it is Sunnah to wash each part three times when doing wudoo’”. This is simply the matter of terminology; in other words, if someone were to say in his book, “If I say something is Sunnah, I mean that is it proven by a Sunnah, and if I say that it is mustahabb, I mean that it is proven by analogy (qiyaas),” then he carries on with this terminology, he is not to be denounced for that.&nbsp;End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (6/421)</p>\n<p>See also: Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ by al-Bahooti (1/87); Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj by ar-Ramli (2/105)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Does teaching English to the imam of the mosque come under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression?",
      "question": "<p>We have a new imam in our community. He graduated from al Azhar. Although there is some good points about him, he seems to have an incorrect manhaj and is a little bit loose. He does some of the smaller things such as keeping a very short beard and other things. My question is, my parents commanded me to teach him english. Will this be part of the ayah which says do not help each other in wrongdoing since he may use this english to teach this incorrect manhaj. For the time being, there seems to be more good than bad from him, however, he may change as he stays in this kaffir country. Please advice me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What your parents have     asked you to do of teaching this imam does not come under the heading of     cooperating in sin and transgression. The fact that this imam goes against     sharee’ah in some issues means that you have to advise him and remind him     lest he continue with those infractions and fall into others, especially as     you are going to form a special relationship with him by teaching him     English.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cooperating in sin and     transgression would be the case if you were to be the cause of some sin or     continuing it or spreading it, or if you helped the one who is doing it with     some idea or money or physical help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of cooperating in     sin and transgression include: renting out stores to riba-based banks or     stores that sell haraam things, joining a businessman in manufacturing,     selling or buying haraam things, or helping followers of bid’ah (innovation)     financially or by enabling them to speak to the Muslims, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the verse     (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and     At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in     sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5;2], Allaah enjoins His believing     slaves to help one another to do good deeds, which is righteousness, and to     avoid bad deeds, which refers to piety; and He forbids them to help one     another in falsehood or cooperate in sin and haraam actions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer     (1/12, 13)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because this imam has some     good qualities, we hope that you can strengthen them and help him to fulfil     them and attain more. This will be cooperating in righteousness and piety.     As for his bad qualities, we hope that you will denounce them and advise him     to give them up, and this will also come under the heading of cooperating in     righteousness and piety and the sincere advice that is required of Muslims.     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the     fear about this imam being influenced by staying in the land of kufr does     not apply only to him, rather it applies to him, to you and to all the     Muslims. What we have seen and heard is sufficient proof that people are     influenced.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have previously stated     that it is not permissible to stay in a kaafir country unless one has a     legitimate shar’i excuse and meets the conditions laid down by sharee’ah.
