      "title": "What is the ruling on ghabqa in Ramadan?",
      "question": "<p>Is the ghabqa (ghabqah) in Ramadan permissible? It is a Ramadan supper that is usually served before the last ten nights. This is a tradition in the Gulf countries, in which supper is made between iftar and sahoor, and there are competitions, traditional songs, traditional dress, and so on.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This ghabqa is a feast, and feasts come under the heading of customs and traditions, which are in principle permissible.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>People’s activities – words and deeds – are of two types: that which they have to do in order for their faith to be sound and that which they need to do so that their worldly affairs will be sound. By examining the Islamic guidelines, we learn that the acts of worship that Allah has enjoined and that He likes cannot be proven except on the basis of religious texts.</p>\n<p>As for people’s customs and traditions, this refers to what people are accustomed to and need with regard to the way in which they run their worldly affairs. In principle, they are not prohibited, so nothing is to be prohibited except what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has prohibited.</p>\n<p>The basic principle regarding customs and traditions is that they are to be overlooked, so nothing of them is prohibited except what Allah has prohibited, otherwise we will be among those referred to in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): <em>{Say, “Have you seen what Allah has sent down to you of provision of which you have made [some] lawful and [some] unlawful?”} [Yoonus 10:59]</em>. Hence Allah criticized the polytheists who introduced religious practices for which Allah did not give permission, and they forbade that which He did not forbid.… This is an important and beneficial principle.\" (<em>Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa</em>&nbsp;29/16-18).</p>\n<p>However, it is very important to point out that these meals should be free of any haraam elements such as extravagance, wastefulness, boasting or wasting the nights of Ramadan in leisure and entertainment.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "it is possible to fly with the help of jinn or angel?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to seek the help of the jinn or angels to fly?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>In the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/102843\">102843</a> we stated that seeking the help of the jinn is prohibited according to Islamic teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By the same token, it is not permissible to call upon the angels, seek their help or ask them to meet one’s needs instead of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; rather that comes under the heading of shirk (associating others with Allah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever regards the angels and Prophets as intermediaries, calling upon them, putting his trust in them and asking them to bring benefits and ward off harm is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/124)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee said:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to use the jinn in any manner whatsoever, because that comes under the heading of seeking the help of the jinn and devils, which is haraam and is one of the means that lead to shirk. It is also not permissible to believe in anything that the practitioners of witchcraft say, because of the evil consequences to which that leads.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/102)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seeking help from the jinn or angels, or seeking their aid to bring benefit or ward off harm, or to protect oneself from the evil of the jinn, is all major shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam – Allah forbid – regardless of whether that is done by means of calling them, writing their names and wearing it as an amulet, or washing (that writing) and drinking the water, and so on, if one believes that the amulet or the water – and not Allah – will bring benefit or ward off harm.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/134-135)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another of the tricks that the Shaytaan uses against people is to make a person thinks that if he seeks the help of the angels, calls upon them, and asks them for what he needs, then if he is helped and his needs are met, he thinks that it is the angels who helped him. This is one of the tricks and plots of the Shaytaan, for the angels do not help anyone to associate others with Allah. Rather it is his shaytaan who has helped him, in order to confuse him about his religion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up: it is not permissible to seek the help of the angels or the jinn, whether to fly or to do anything else. Rather in all his affairs the individual should seek the help of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If you seek help, then seek help from Allah.” Narrated by Ahmad (2664); narrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (2516); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But with regard to physical, tangible matters, there is nothing wrong with seeking them from a person who owns them or has control over them, or seeking his help with regard to that. In that case this person is one of a number of means and measures that the accountable person may take.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to seek the help of the jinn or those who are absent, because this comes under the heading of associating others with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Seeking help is an act of worship and it is not permissible to direct it to anyone other than Allah, whether that is a jinn or a human or an angel or anything else, except in the case of a living human being who is present and is able to do something, such as seeking the help of a living and capable human being to cultivate land, build structures and fight enemies. But in the case of the jinn, the ruling on those who are present is the same as the ruling on those who are absent: it is not permissible to seek their help in anything whatsoever, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [al-Faatihah 1:5]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you seek help, then seek the help of Allah.”</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/198)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the possibility of flying by seeking the help of the jinn, this is possible in and of itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The jinn still carry people and fly with them from one place to another.</p>\n<p>End quote from an-Nubuwwaat (2/804)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those whom the jinn carry and fly with them from one place to another, in most cases they do not know how they are carried].</p>\n<p>End quote from an-Nubuwwaat (2/998)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But not everything that is possible is acceptable in Islam. Most sins, such as associating others with Allah, stealing, zina, murder, and so on are things that it is possible for people to do, but the fact that something is possible on its own is not sufficient to indicate that something is acceptable or permissible. Rather what is acceptable or permissible or prohibited is in accordance with what Allah has prescribed for His slaves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/124838\">124838</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He did tawaaf during Hajj inside the Hijr",
      "question": "<p>I did Hajj for the first time, and when I circumambulated the Ka’bah, in most of the circuits around the Ka’bah I cut it short and omitted the wall that is separate from the Ka’bah bur close to its northern side. What is the ruling on my Hajj?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If the tawaaf that you are asking about was tawaaf     al-ifaadah, which is the one that is done after standing in ‘Arafah, then     your tawaaf is not valid and this Hajj is not valid, unless you repeated     this tawaaf, because tawaaf al-ifaadah is one of the pillars or essential     parts of the Hajj. So you have to go back to the Sacred Mosque and     circumambulate the Ka’bah seven times, starting each circuit from the Black     Stone and ending the seventh circuit at the Black Stone, and each circuit     must go outside Hijr Ismaa’eel from behind the wall. Thus your Hajj will     become acceptable. But if the tawaaf in question was the farewell tawaaf,     then you have to offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah and given to     the poor, in order to complete your Hajj, but you do not have to go back to     the Ka’bah, and if you do go back it will not waive the obligation to offer     a sacrifice. But if it was a naafil tawaaf, then you do not have to do     anything.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for the husband to forsake his wife for no legitimate shar‘i reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The legitimate shar‘i reasons for forsaking include: wilful defiance (nushooz) on the part of the wife and looking down at her husband, and disobedience towards his commands. In that case it is prescribed to admonish her, then to forsake her, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great”</p>\n<p>[An-Nisa’ 4:34].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This forsaking has to do with the physical relationship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to not speaking to her, it is not permissible for him to forsake her for more than three days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (20/261), concerning a man who forsook his wife for more than three months:</p>\n<p>Whoever forsakes his wife for more than three months, if that is because of wilful defiance and ill conduct on her part, i.e., she disobeyed her husband with regard to what she is obliged to fulfil of marital duties towards him, and persisted in that after he admonished her and reminded her to fear Allah, may He be exalted, and reminded her of the duties that she owes to her husband, then he may forsake her in bed for as long as he wants, in order to discipline her so that she will fulfil her duties towards her husband willingly. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) shunned his wives, and stayed away from them for a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But with regard to not speaking, it is not permissible for him to forsake or shun her in that sense for more than three days, because of the saheeh report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the hadith of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his brother (fellow Muslim) for more than three days.” Narrated by Imam al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their Saheehs and by Ahmad in his Musnad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you were not wilfully disobedient (nushooz), then his shunning you is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What the husband must do is share his time equitably between both wives. If he gets angry with one wife, he does not have the right to spend the night with the other; rather he must spend the night with her, even if he shuns her in bed, if doing so is justified, because of what is confirmed of the command to treat co-wives fairly, and because of the prohibition on shunning by staying out of the house.</p>\n<p>Ibn Maajah (1850) narrated from Hakeem ibn Mu‘aawiyah, from his father, that a man asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): What are the rights of the woman over her husband? He said, “That he should feed her as he feeds himself and clothe her as he clothes himself; he should not strike her on the face or curse her, and he should not forsake her except in the house (as a form of discipline).”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The view of our companions is: the man is obliged to stay in his wife’s house one night out of four. This staying overnight guarantees two things: firstly that they will come together in the house and secondly that they will come together in the bed. The words of Allah, may He be exalted, “refuse to share their beds” along with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “forsaking should only be in the sense of refraining from intimacy” indicate that it is obligatory to spend the night in the same house, even when refusing to share the bed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad stated concerning the one who fasts by day and prays qiyaam at night: This indicates that it is obligatory to spend the night with his wife and share her bed, and in the case of wilful defiance (nushooz), he may keep away from intimacy with her, but he should not go further than that.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mustadrak ‘ala Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/217)</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we assume that your husband wanted to punish you for saying that you were going to sleep with the sisters, then all that he can do is forsake you after admonishing you, and we have stated above that forsaking can only be by refraining from intimacy whilst still spending the night in your house. Based on that, your husband made a mistake by leaving you in the house and spending the night with his other wife.</p>\n<p>If it was not the matter of a punishment; rather he thought that you wanted to spend the night with the sisters, which would mean that he did not have to&nbsp; spend the night with you, then he should have listened to you when you said that that was not the case, and he should have given you your rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The husband has to make up the nights that he missed with his wife for no good reason. So he should stay overnight with her for the number of nights that he missed, and then go back to dividing his time between both wives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If he leaves the house during the time that is allocated to one of his wives, if that was during the day, or at the beginning of the night, or at the end of the night when people usually get up and go out to the prayer, then that is permissible, because the Muslims go out for ‘Isha’ prayer and for Fajr prayer before dawn breaks, and during the day they go out to earn a livelihood and do errands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he goes out at other times, but is not out for long before he comes back, then he does not have to make it up to her, because there is no benefit in making that up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he stays out, then he should make it up to her, regardless of whether he stayed out for a valid reason, such as work or being detained or some other valid reason, because she missed out on her rights due to his absence from her.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni (8/145)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice is to resolve the problems in an atmosphere of love and harmony, paying attention to people’s rights, but if you give up your right concerning the days when he was angry with you, that will be better for you and your husband. You should forgive one another and communicate with one another, especially since some of the scholars think that the right of the wife who was wronged has already been missed and the husband does not have to make it up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also question&nbsp;no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/ar/answers/166912\" target=\"_blank\">166912</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Using a credit card with the intention of not delaying payment",
      "question": "<p>I live in occupied Jerusalem, Palestine. As you know there are no Islamic banks here, all banks deal with interest. What is the ruling on using the credit cards of these banks, knowing that if I delay paying in a specific date I will have to pay the interest to the bank? But I will never delay paying in order to avoid paying the interest. I know that this card is considered a Riba contract. And that what is built on wrong will remain wrong, but I do not take or pay interest. <br />\n<br />\nI intend to use it as I cannot afford some very expensive things at once, only by installments. I do not know if the things I want to buy are necessary in the Sharia’s point of view, but I am in need of them as soon as possible. I do not want to follow my desire and deviate from the right. Note that I pay a fixed monthly amount for this credit card service regardless how many times I used it.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is not     permissible to use credit cards that stipulate payment of interest even if a     person intends to pay it off on time, because it is not permissible to     approve of riba or enter a contract that includes it. And because a person     may fall into riba as the result of delaying payments due to forgetting,     travelling and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn     ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: The banks give their     customers a credit card called Visa which enables the customer to withdraw     money from his account even if there is no money in his account at that     moment, on condition that he pay the bank back within a certain amount of     time. If he does not pay it back within that time limit, then the bank will     ask for more than the customer withdrew. Please note that the customer will     pay a set amount to the bank in return for using this card. I hope that you     can explain the ruling on using this card.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:     This transaction is haraam, because the one who enters it is committing to     paying riba if he does not pay off within the time limit, and this is a     invalid commitment, even if a person believes or thinks it most likely that     he will pay it off in full before the time limit ends, because circumstances     may change and he may not be able to pay it off. This has to do with the     future and no one knows what will happen to him in the future. Such     transactions are haraam. And Allaah knows best.

Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><em>{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you, that you may become righteous}&nbsp;[al-Baqarah 2:183]</em>.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, giving zakah, Hajj and fasting Ramadan.”</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/232694\" target=\"_blank\">The one who does not fast has failed to observe one of the pillars of Islam</a> and has committed a grave major sin. In fact, some of the early generations were of the view that he is a disbeliever and apostate– we seek refuge with Allah from that.</p>\n<p>Abu Ya‘la narrated in his Musnad from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The bonds of Islam and the foundations of the faith are three, on which Islam is based. Whoever fails to do one of them becomes a disbeliever thereby and may be executed [for apostasy…this would be in an Islamic state and there would be due process]: testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, offering the prescribed prayers, and fasting in Ramadan.</p>\n<p>This hadith was classed as sahih by adh-Dhahabi; it was classed as hasan by al-Haythami in <em>Majma‘ az-Zawaid</em> (1/48) and al-Mundhiri in <em>at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib</em>, no. 805, 1486; it was classed as da‘if (weak) by al-Albani in <em>as-Silsilah ad-Da‘ifah</em>, no. 94.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi said in <em>al-Kabair</em>, p. 64: Among the believers it is established that whoever fails to fast the month of Ramadan, without being sick and without any excuse that would make that permissible, is worse than the zani and the one who is addicted to alcohol. In fact, they doubted whether he was a Muslim, and thought that he was a heretic. End quote.</p>\n<p>What has been soundly narrated of warnings against failing to fast is that which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibban (7491) from Abu Umamah al-Bahili, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:</p>\n<p>Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: ‘Climb up.’ I said: ‘I cannot do it.’ They said: ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: ‘What are these voices?’ They said: ‘This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: ‘Who are these?’ They said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so.’” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Mawarid al-Zam‘an, 1509.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then deliberately broke his fast before the time for iftar had come. So how about one who does not fast at all? We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_kind_of_sickness_makes_it_permissible_to_break_the_fast\">What kind of sickness makes it permissible to break the fast?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12488\" target=\"_blank\">The kind of sickness that makes it permissible to break the fast </a> is sickness that will cause real hardship to the one who fasts.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi said in <em>al-Majmu‘</em> (6/261):</p>\n<p>The sick person who is unable to fast because of a sickness from which there is hope of recovery is not obliged to fast.… This applies if he will suffer real hardship when fasting. It is not stipulated that he should have reached the state in which he is unable to fast at all. Rather our companions said: For it to be permissible not to fast, it is stipulated that fasting should cause significant hardship that makes it difficult to fast. End quote.</p>\n<p>And he said:</p>\n<p>With regard to mild sickness that does not cause real hardship, it is not permissible for him not to fast, and there is no difference of opinion among us concerning that.\" (A<em>l-Majmu‘</em>&nbsp; 6/261).</p>\n<p>If your wife who is a new Muslim will not face hardship if she fasts, then it is not permissible for her not to fast. You must explain that to her, and tell her that not fasting is a major sin. She should consult a doctor about the sleep issues and anxiety, and there is nothing wrong with taking medicine for that, if necessary. Whatever she needs of medicine to help her sleep or deal with anxiety, and the like, can be taken at night, so long as that is possible, so that she can maintain her fast and not transgress the sanctity of the month just because of anxiety or anxious thoughts.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The second witness was not present when the marriage contract was done; is his marriage valid?",
      "question": "<p>I have got married, praise be to Allah, but there is something that is worrying me. When I did the marriage contract I did it in the courtroom (in Syria) and I asked about the official (who conducted the marriage), and I was told that he was a Muslim who prayed, but he was clean shaven. The problem is that when the marriage contract was done, there was no one there except one witness, who is my paternal uncle, my father's brother, who witnessed the marriage contract. The other witness was a Muslim lawyer, who came in and signed the documents and left, and he did not stay to witness and hear the proposal and acceptance. Is this marriage contract done in this manner valid, or is it essential for the witness to hear the proposal and acceptance?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The purpose behind having witnesses when the marriage contract is done is so that her the proposal from the woman's wali (guardian) or from the one who is acting in his stead, such as a wakeel (deputy or proxy), will be heard, and the acceptance from her husband or one who is acting in his stead, will be heard too. If the proposal and acceptance are written down and the witness's is deaf, for example, and he witnessed what was written during the marriage contract, then his testimony is valid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly” [al-Zukhruf 43:86]. If the knowledge of what is happening reaches the witness, that is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti‘, 5/162&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that announcing and publicising the marriage and informing the people of it is sufficient and there is no need for special witnesses; rather it is stronger than that. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars said that it is stipulated that the marriage should either be witnessed or announced, i.e., proclaimed openly, and that if it is announced, that is sufficient, because it is furthest removed from any doubt.&nbsp; There are some reservations about not having the marriage witnessed is risky, because a man may commit zina with a woman, then if she gets pregnant from him, he will claim that he married her, when that is not the case. So having the marriage witnessed is stipulated for this reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if it is announced, then this reservation no longer applies, because it is stronger than just having it witnessed. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), as he stipulated either having the marriage witnessed or announcing it. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there are witnesses but the marriage is not announced, then there is some doubt as to whether the marriage contract is valid, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined that marriages be announced, and said: “Proclaim the wedding.” And because there is the fear that secret marriage will lead to negative consequences, even if it is witnessed, because a man may commit zina - Allah forbid - with a woman then say: ‘I married her,’ then he summons two false witnesses and they give their (false) testimony. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti‘, 5/160&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This proves that announcing the marriage is stronger than only having the marriage contract witnessed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) summed up the issue of having the marriage witnessed and announcing it by saying: There is no doubt that doing the marriage contract along with announcing the marriage is valid, even if it is not witnessed by two witnesses, but if it is concealed and witnessed, this is something concerning which there is some doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is both witnessed and announced, there is no doubt as to its validity in this case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is neither witnessed nor announced, then it is invalid according to all scholars, and if there is any difference of opinion, it is very little.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 177&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words ‘There is no doubt that doing the marriage contract along with announcing the marriage is valid, even if it is not witnessed by two witnesses’ indicate that there is no need to worry about what you mentioned. Even if we assume that the witnessing was not valid, announcing the marriage is sufficient in sha Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But it should be noted that the word witness does not apply only to the one who signs the marriage&nbsp; contract; rather it refers to everyone who is present when the marriage contract is done, such as the scribe, relatives, the official and others. They are all witnesses to it, if they are fit to be witnesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Eating seven dates in the morning and the impact of believing in that on the healing effect",
      "question": "<p>I have Qs regarding eating dates and magic. Can one eat 'any' dates in 7, or they must be ajwa? And if only ajwa, then must they only be ajwa from Al-'Aliya? And do they benefit before magic is spelled on someone or after it is spelled and one is afflicted with sihr? Or both, before and after? Before, they are like shield from sihr? And after, they have healing effect?</p>\n<p>And do they benefit only someone who believes in these ahaadeeth? Or anyone? i mean, a Muslim only? .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (5445) and Muslim (2047) narrated from Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats seven ‘ajwah dates in the morning, will not be harmed by any poison or witchcraft that day.”</p>\n<p>Most of the scholars are of the view that this applies only to the dates of Madinah, and specifically to a particular type of the dates of Madinah, namely ‘ajwah dates, which grow in ‘Aaliyat al-Madinah. This is most likely to be correct, and it is the apparent meaning of the hadith.</p>\n<p>Some scholars are of the view that it is general in meaning, and that all types of dates are efficacious against poison and witchcraft. Among those who were of this view among contemporary scholars are Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them). This has been discussed previously in question no. 205041.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that the hadith applies specifically to the people of Madinah and those in the vicinity, because of their physical makeup which is accustomed to that environment.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This hadith is addressed to a specific audience, such as the people of Madinah and those in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>End quote from Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/90).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The hadith clearly states that eating dates in the morning is efficacious in warding off witchcraft before it occurs, but it is not far-fetched to suggest that they would also have the effect of removing it after it occurred, especially since it is well-known that witchcraft may be undone by means of treatment with remedies and ruqyah as prescribed in sharee‘ah, so the sorcerer would have to repeat the spell that he cast on that person. For that reason, the sick person should persist in eating seven dates every morning until he is fully recovered and so that he may be safe in the future – by Allah’s leave – from the harm of sorcerers and devils.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>The one who acts in accordance with these hadiths may find the effect of protection against poison and witchcraft, even if he does not believe in it, as it says in the story of the one who was stung by a scorpion [who was a disbeliever], who was treated with ruqyah by reciting Soorat al-Faatihah over him.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This hadith refers to achieving healing by reciting al-Faatihah over the person who had been stung, so that he no longer needed regular medicine, and perhaps it healed him far better than regular medicine could have done, even though the recipient of the treatment was not the best candidate, either because the people of this tribe were not Muslim or because they were miserly and mean people. So how about if he had been a good candidate for such treatment?</p>\n<p>End quote from Madaarij as-Saalikeen (1/79).</p>\n<p>But having faith in the remedy will make it more effective and will make one more receptive to healing. This applies to all types of medicine, but in the case of psychological disease it is more effective than in the case of physical disease.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Many remedies are more effective if one has faith in them and takes them willingly and happily. People have seen wonders in that regard, because in that case human nature is highly receptive to medicine, and&nbsp; the soul feels joy in having it, which revives the patient’s strength and reinforces his natural defences, causing his body’s resources to come together to resist disease and ward off the harm. On the other hand, many medicines may be effective for a particular disease, but what nullifies their effect is if the patient does not believe in the remedy and his body does not accept it, so it does not help him at all.</p>\n<p>You may think of the greatest medicines and remedies, and the most beneficial for hearts and bodies, and the most useful in this world and the hereafter, namely the Qur’an which is healing for every disease, and how it does not benefit hearts that do not believe that it contains healing and benefit; rather it only increases them in (spiritual) sickness. There is no medicine that could heal hearts more effectively than the Qur’an, for it brings complete healing for hearts that does not leave any sickness behind, but it cures it, and it preserves (spiritual) health in perfect order, granting full protection from every harmful thing.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the fact that most hearts turn away from it (the Qur’an) and do not have firm belief in it, when there is no doubt that it is a healing, and they fail to use it and ignore it in favour of other medicines that are put together by human beings, prevents hearts from attaining healing; habits and customs take over, aversion becomes greater, chronic diseases and sickness become entrenched in people’s hearts, and patients and doctors become accustomed to human remedies and what their shaykhs and those whom they venerate and hold in high esteem prescribe for them, thus the calamity is exacerbated and the disease worsens.</p>\n<p>Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/92).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to wipe over two layers of socks worn one over another? If that is permissible and a person wipes over them, then takes off one layer and then breaks his wudoo’, is it permissible for him to wipe over the other or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is permissible for a person to wear two layers of khufoof     or socks. If he wipes over one – in cases where it is permissible to do so,     as we shall see below – then he takes one off, and breaks his wudoo’, it is     permissible for him to wipe over the other, according to the opinion of some     of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) a number     of scenarios in which a person wears two layers of khufoof or socks, as     follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – If a person put on socks or khufoof then broke his     wudoo’, then put on another pair before doing wudoo’, the ruling applies to     the first layer, i.e., if he wants to wipe over them after that, he has to     wipe over the first layer, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over     the second layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – If he puts on socks or khufoof, then he breaks his wudoo’     and wipes over them, then he puts on a second layer, then he may wipe over     the second layer according to the sound view. It says in al-Furoo’:     That is permissible according to Maalik. End quote. Al-Nawawi said: This is     the best view, because he put them on in a state of purity (tahaarah), and     their view that it is a lesser kind of purity is not acceptable. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If we accept that, then the period of wiping starts from the     first time he wiped over the first layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In this case he may also wipe over the first layer, without a     doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – If he puts khufoof on over khufoof or socks, and he wipes     the outer layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the     remainder of the period? I did not see any clear statement on this, but     al-Nawawi stated that Abu’l-‘Abbaas ibn Surayj said that if he puts     overshoes over the khufoof then one of three scenarios must apply: one of     which is that they become like a single khuff, with the upper layer visible     and the second layer like a lining, therefore he may wipe over the lower     layer until the period for wiping ends from the time he wiped over the upper     layer, which is like the case when the outer surface of the khuff becomes     worn or scratched – it is permissible to wipe over the lining.” End quote     from Fataawa al-Tahaarah, p. 192&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The “overshoe” (jurmooq) is something that is worn over the     regular khufoof, especially in cold countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 1/130&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/211&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",
