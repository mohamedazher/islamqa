      "title": "Permissibility of following the imaam from behind the door of the mosque",
      "question": "<p>The nature of the place in which we pray is such that when it gets full, we close the door, and some people pray outside the prayer-place, following the imaam by hearing his voice on the loudspeakers. Is their prayer valid even though they are outside the mosque?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It           was narrated that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him)           said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace           and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was staying in a hut made of palm           leaves. He prayed in that hut and some men followed him, they came and           prayed with him. And in the hadeeth in which this incident is described,           it says: “The best prayer of a man is prayers offered in his house,           except for the obligatory prayers.” (Agreed upon) </p>\n<p>&nbsp;This           hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to follow the imaam even if           he is in a room where the person following him cannot see him, or if           one of them is on the roof and the other is in a lower place. The point           is that if it is possible to follow the imaam if they are all inside           the mosque, there is no dispute among the scholars that it is permissible           for him to do so. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;The           hadeeth also indicates that the presence of a barrier between the imaam           and the members of the congregation does not mean that the prayer and           their following the imaam are invalid. Al-Nawawi said: “For their following           to be valid, the person following has to know when the imaam moves,           whether they are praying in the mosque or elsewhere, or one of them           is in the mosque and the other is outside – this is according to scholarly           consensus.” </p>\n<p>&nbsp;If           one of them is outside the mosque and he can see the imaam or other           members of the congregation, even if the rows are interrupted, the prayer           is valid because there is nothing to make it invalid and there is something           to make it valid – which is that he can see either the imaam or some           of the people behind him, and he is able to follow the prayer. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;In           al-Insaaf it says: with           regard to the continuity of the rows, reference should be made to al-‘urf           (local custom, i.e., what is traditionally regarded as being complete),           according to the correct view. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;It           says in al-Mughni: interruptions           (in the rows) do not matter. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa'i,           because there is no limit in that, since it does not prevent following           the imaam. What matters here is what would prevent a person from seeing           or hearing the imaam. Al-Nawawi made it a condition that there should           not be big gaps outside the mosque, which is the view of the majority           of scholars. And Allaah knows best. </p>\n",

Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (At-Tayyibat) and evil or prohibited (Al-khaba’ith), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">{And He makes good things lawful for them and bad things prohibited.} [Al-A'`raf 7:157]</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\"><span id=\"Health_Risks_of_Smoking_An_Islamic_Perspective\">Health Risks of Smoking: An Islamic Perspective</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Considering this fact, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Thus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking.</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:left\">\n<li>There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Allah said (interpretation of meaning):</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">{Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you.} [An-Nisa’ 4:29]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In addition, His Prophet&nbsp;(peace and blessings be upon him) said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">\"There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islam).\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">He&nbsp;(peace and blessings be upon him) also said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">\"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ... his body as to what he engaged it in.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him):</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">\"Your body has a right on you.\"</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:left\">\n<li>There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1812\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smoking is harmful for the health of others</a>&nbsp; who inhale the polluted breath of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children.</li>\n<li>The offensive smell caused by <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11286\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of Allah among humans and angels</a>&nbsp;. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">{Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin.} [Al-Ahzab 33:58]</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:left\">\n<li>The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance.

Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan} [Al-Isra’ 17:26-27]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Extravagance (in Islam) means spending on something prohibited.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Spending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)&nbsp;said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">\"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ..... what he owned as to how he spent it.\"</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\"><span id=\"Is_Smoking_Prohibited_in_Islam\">Is Smoking Prohibited in Islam?</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Considering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others.

If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">We ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up.

      "title": "Ruling on inviting people to fast together on a particular day and offer supplication (du`a) on that day",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on inviting people to fast together on a particular day, and all recite a specific supplication (specifying what is to be said in that supplication), and at a specific time (such as saying: “We invite everyone at such and such an hour Makkah time) to support our Muslim brothers in Palestine, or some other Muslim country; please share and circulate this invitation, by text or Internet”)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslims faced crises at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions and those who came after them, and they did not call on one another to fast on a specific day and offer specific supplications at a specific time. Thus it is known that doing this is an innovation (bid‘ah); if it was something good, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions would have done it.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on fasting together and agreeing to meet for iftar, whether that is during Ramadan or on Mondays and Thursdays?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>No, the most serious issue is agreeing to fast on a particular day. We think that this is something that the Sahabah never did; they never agreed or promised one another that they would fast on Mondays and Thursdays, and so on, and there is the fear that the matter may develop into something more serious than that, in which case we would be imitating the Sufis who agree to recite a specific dhikr, which they get together and recite in unison. Hence if someone says to his friends: ‘Whoever fasts tomorrow, iftar will be at So-and-so’s house,’ there is nothing wrong with that, but agreeing and promising one another to fast on a specific day, this is not the practice of the Sahabah. Moreover, the fact that a person gets accustomed to not fasting unless someone else fasts with him is problematic. The individual should fast on his own initiative, regardless of whether someone else is fasting with him or not. This is the way of the righteous early generations.\"(<em>Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh</em>&nbsp; 174/24).</p>\n<p>He was also asked about some people who get together in the blessed month of Ramadan to recite some adhkar and du`as that are narrated in the Sunnah; they do that before the time of iftar and they recite together in unison. Is it permissible for us to do that?</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:</p>\n<p>When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave a khutbah, his eyes turned red, he raised his voice and sounded angry, and he said: “To proceed: the best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad; the worst of matters are those that are newly introduced into the religion. Every innovation is a going astray, and every going astray leads to the Fire.” When he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) broke his fast, he did not call people together so that they could remember Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, or call upon Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in a loud voice and reciting in unison with others. Rather each person broke his fast with his family, and each person offered supplication by himself, speaking quietly, between him and his Lord. As this habit that is referred to by the questioner was not known at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then we know that it comes under the heading of innovations which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned us against, and explained that every innovation is a going astray, and every going astray leads to the Fire.\"(<em>Fatawa Nur ‘ala al-Darb</em>&nbsp; 212/6-7).</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Suhaym was asked:</p>\n<p>In the past, we always received messages via email asking us to fast on a specific day and to pray qiyam on that day in support of our brothers in Palestine, by way of encouraging us to offer supplication and to exhort one another to hold fast to the truth.</p>\n<p>Is it an innovation (bid‘ah), for a group of us to agree that each of us will pray qiyam at home on a specific night, in which we will offer supplication, reciting du`as from the Quran and Sunnah?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>As for doing righteous deeds for the sake of supporting our brothers in Palestine, I think that this idea is an innovation that originally came from the Christian countries.</p>\n<p>Seventy of the reciters of Quran among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were killed, yet despite that there is nothing to suggest that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted or prayed (salah) for their sake. Rather he offered supplication (du`a), calling upon Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, as is narrated in <em>al-Sahihayn</em>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when he sent the army on the day of Mu’tah, then became aware that some of his companions had been killed, there is no report to suggest that he did any such actions.</p>\n<p>Rather his practice was to offer supplication (du`a) and strive hard in doing so.</p>\n<p>He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) strove hard in offering supplication on the day of Badr.</p>\n<p>He also offered supplication from the minbar on Fridays, and this is something that khatibs need to be reminded of.</p>\n<p>As for agreeing to pray qiyam on a specific night, this is something for which there is no basis in Islamic teachings, unless someone gets up to pray qiyam and others follow his lead and get up to pray qiyam too, without any prior promise or agreement.</p>\n<p>The Prophet’s cousin Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) stood behind him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and joined him in prayer [at night], as did Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) on one occasion.</p>\n<p>And on one occasion, Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) stood behind him and joined him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in praying qiyam.</p>\n<p>But all of that happened without any prior agreement or promise.</p>\n<p>Similar to that is if a man gets up to pray qiyam, and one of his children gets up and prays with him, or if a righteous man stays overnight in someone’s house and gets up to pray qiyam; in that case it is permissible to join him in prayer.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade singling out the night before Friday for praying qiyam, without praying qiyam on other nights, lest anyone think that that night has any particular virtue that other nights do not have.</p>\n<p>I do not think there is any need to make an agreement to pray qiyam on a specific night; rather each of you can encourage and exhort others to pray qiyam and strive hard in offering supplication for the weak and oppressed throughout the world, east and west.\"(Mishkat website).</p>\n<p>What appears to us to be the case is that this invitation is not Islamically acceptable, and it is not appropriate to take part in it or invite others to do so.</p>\n<p>What is required of the Muslim is to offer supplication and pray to Allah for his Muslim brothers everywhere, without allocating a specific time for that or fasting for that purpose.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to save the weak and oppressed believers, and to destroy the oppressors and aggressors.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

This festival became connected with the saint known as Valentine who was sentenced to death on 14 February 270 CE. The kuffar still celebrate this festival, during which immorality and evil are practiced widely.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_Muslims_celebrate_Valentinersquos_Daynbsp\">Can Muslims celebrate Valentine’s Day?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to celebrate any of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/106668\" target=\"_blank\">festivals of the kuffar</a> , because festivals come under the heading of shar’i issues which are to be based on the sound texts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Festivals are part of shari’ah, clear way and rituals of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.” [al-Maidah 5:48]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies which they must follow.” [al-Hajj 22:67]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-- such as the qiblah (direction faced in prayer), prayer and fasting. There is no difference between their participating in the festival and their participating in all other rituals. Joining in fully with the festival is joining in with kufr, and joining in with some of its minor issues is joining in with some of the branches of kufr. Indeed, festivals are one of the most unique features that distinguish various religions and among their most prominent symbols, so joining in with them is joining in with the most characteristic and prominent symbols of kufr. No doubt joining in with this may lead to complete kufr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Partially joining in, at the very least, is disobedience and sin. This was indicated by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “Every people has its festival and this is our festival.” This is worse than joining them in wearing the zinar (a garment that was worn only by ahl al-dhimmah) and other characteristics of theirs, for those characteristics are man-made and are not part of their religion, rather the purpose behind them is simply to distinguish between a Muslim and a kafir. As for the festival and its rituals, this is part of the religion which is cursed along with its followers, so joining in with it is joining in with something that is a cause of incurring the wrath and punishment of Allah.” (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim (1/207)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said (may Allah have mercy on him):</p>\n<p>“It is not permissible for the Muslims to imitate them in anything that is uniquely a part of their festivals, whether it be food, clothing, bathing, lighting fires, refraining from a regular habit, doing acts of worship or anything else. It is not permissible to give a feast or to give gifts, or to sell anything that will help them to do that for that purpose, or to allow children and others to play games that are part of the festivals, or to wear one’s adornments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To conclude: the Mulsims should not do any of their rituals at the time of their festivals; rather the day of their festival should be like any other day for the Muslims. The Muslims should not do anything specific in imitation of them.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa (25/329)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If the Christians have a festival, and the Jews have a festival, it is only for them, so no Muslim should join them in that, just as no Muslim should join them in their religion or their direction of prayer.” (Tashabbuh al-Khasis bi Ahl al-Khamis, published in Majallat al-Hikmah (4/193)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadith to which Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah referred was narrated by al-Bukhari (952) and Muslim (892) from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: Abu Bakr came in and there were two young girls of the Ansar with me who were singing about what had happened to the Ansar on the day of Bu’ath. She said: And they were not (professional) singing girls. Abu Bakr said: “Musical instruments of the shaytan in the house of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?!” and that was on the day of ‘Eid. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Abu Bakr, every people has a festival and this is our festival.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (1134) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, they had two days when they would play. He said: “What are these two days?” They said: “We used to play on these days during the Jahiliyyah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has given you instead of them two days that are better than them: the day of al-Adha and the day of al-Fitr.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates that festivals are among the characteristics by which nations are distinguished, and it is not permissible to celebrate the festivals of the ignorant and the mushrikin (polytheists).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fatwas_on_celebrating_Valentinersquos_Day\">Fatwas on celebrating Valentine’s Day</span></h3>\n<p>The scholars have issued fatwas stating that it is haram to celebrate Valentine’s Day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 –Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In recent times the celebration of Valentine’s Day has become widespread, especially among female students. It is a Christian festival where people dress completely in red, including clothes and shoes, and they exchange red flowers. We hope that you can explain the ruling on celebrating this festival, and what your advice is to Muslims with regard to such matters; may Allah bless you and take care of you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Celebrating Valentine’s Day is not permissible for a number of reasons. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10070\" target=\"_blank\">innovated festival</a> for which there is no basis in Islam.</p>\n<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It promotes love and infatuation.</p>\n<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It calls for hearts to be preoccupied with foolish matters that are contrary to the way of the righteous salaf (may Allah be pleased with them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible on this day to do any of the things that are characteristic of this festival, whether that has to do with food, drinks, clothing, exchanging gifts or anything else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim should be proud of his religion and should not be a weak character who follows every Tom, Dick and Harry. I ask Allah to protect the Muslims from all temptations, visible and invisible, and to protect us and guide us.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (16/199)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – The Standing Committee was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Some people celebrate Valentine’s Day on the fourteenth of February every year. They exchange gifts of red roses and wear red clothes and congratulate one another. Some bakeries make red coloured sweets and draw hearts on them, and some stores advertise products that are especially for this day. What is your opinion on the following?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celebrating this day</p>\n<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buying things from the stores on this day</p>\n<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Storekeepers who are not celebrating it selling things that may be given as gifts to people who are celebrating it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The clear evidence of the Quran and Sunnah – and the consensus of the early generations of this ummah – indicates that there are only two festivals in Islam: ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any other festivals that have to do with a person, a group, an event or anything else are innovated festivals, which it is not permissible for Muslims to observe, approve of or express joy on those occasions, or to help others to celebrate them in any way, because that is transgressing the sacred limits of Allah, and whoever transgresses the sacred limits of Allah has wronged himself.</p>\n<p>If the fabricated festival is also a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12777\" target=\"_blank\">festival of the kuffar</a> , then the sin is even greater, because this is imitating them and it is a kind of taking them as close friends, and Allah has forbidden the believers to imitate them and take them as close friends in His Noble Book. And it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Valentine’s Day comes under this heading because it is an idolatrous <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1130\" target=\"_blank\">Christian festival</a> , so it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe it or approve of it or congratulate people on it. Rather he has to ignore it and avoid it, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and so as to keep away from the causes that incur the wrath and punishment of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also haram for the Muslim to help people to celebrate this or any other haram festival by supplying any kind of food or drink, or buying or selling or manufacturing or giving or advertising etc., because all of that is cooperating in sin and transgression and is disobedience towards Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [al-Maidah 5:2]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim must adhere to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah in all his affairs, especially at times of fitnah when evil is widespread. He should be smart and avoid falling into the misguidance of those who have earned Allah’s anger and who have gone astray, and the evildoers who have no fear of Allah and who do not have any pride in being Muslims. The Muslim must turn to Allah and seek His guidance and remain steadfast in following it, for there is no Guide except Allah and no one can make a person steadfast but Him. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Among our young men and women it has become common to celebrate Valentine’s Day, which is named after a saint who is venerated by the Christians, who celebrate it every year on February 14, when they exchange gifts and red roses, and they wear red clothes. What is the ruling on celebrating this day and exchanging gifts?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firstly: it is not permissible to celebrate these innovated festivals, because it is an innovation for which there is no basis in Islam. It comes under the heading of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: it involves imitating the kuffar and copying them by venerating that which they venerate and respecting their festivals and rituals, and imitating them in something that is part of their religion. In the hadith it says: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly: it results in evils and haram things such as wasting time, singing, music, extravagance, unveiling, wanton display, men mixing with women, women appearing before men other than their mahrams, and other haram things, or things that are a means that lead to immorality. That cannot be excused by the claim that this is a kind of entertainment and fun. The one who is sincere towards himself should keep away from sin and the means that lead to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, it is not permissible to sell these gifts and roses, if it is known that the purchaser celebrates these festivals or will give these things as gifts on those days, so that the seller will not be a partner of the one who does those innovations. And Allah knows best.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "When should the words al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) be said? In the first adhaan or in the second?",
      "question": "<p>I have been studying with this Shaikh in Dubai for the last two years. He revealed an astonishing so called fact that `As salatu Khairum minan Naoom`in FAJR Adhan is a Bi`da cause Hazarat Bilal use to use these words in TAHAJJUD Adhan and IBN MAKTOUM use to call the FAJR Adhan where by he did not use these words.The other evidence is that, by meaning of these words you are trying to compare SLEEP with FAJR Salat which should not be the case. He also said that Shaikh Albaani had made a Du`aa for the youngsters of today asking ALLAH to give them Hidaya to stop this Bi`da. If my Teacher is correct, why is it being followed in Mecca and Madina as well. Please give me your comments.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is narrated in a number of saheeh ahaadeeth that the words al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) are to be said in the adhaan for Fajr. It is mentioned in some of them that this phrase is to be said in the first adhaan without stating what is meant by the phrase “the first adhaan” – is it the adhaan that is given before Fajr or is it the adhaan of Fajr itself?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I used to give the adhaan for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the first adhaan of Fajr I used to say: “Hayya ‘ala al-falaah, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, Allaahu akbar Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (come to prosperity, prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is no god but Allaah).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood, 500; al-Nasaa’i, 647; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: In the first adhaan after the word al-falaah it said: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Shaykh al-Albaani said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated by al-Tahhaawi (1/82) with a hasan isnaad as al-Haafiz said in al-Talkhees (3/169).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 131&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth provide evidence for those who said that this should be said in the first adhaan which comes at the end of the night. But the correct view is that it should be in said the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer has begun. That is for a number of reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(a)</p>\n<p>The word awwal (first) is in relation to the iqaamah, and the iqaamah is the second call to prayer. In the saheeh Sunnah there are reports in which the iqaamah is called an “adhaan”, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Between each two calls (adhaanayn)...” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 598; Muslim, 838.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Saheeh Muslim (739) the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer begins is called the first adhaan. This appears in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) about the prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said: He used to sleep during the first part of the night and wake up during the latter part, then if he had any need for intimacy with his wife he would satisfy that need, then he would sleep. Then when it was the time of the first call, he would wake up and pour water over himself, and if he was not junub he would do wudoo’ as a man does for prayer, then he would pray two rak’ahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by two rak'ahs here is the regular Sunnah of Fajr, as stated by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b)</p>\n<p>In some saheeh ahaadeeth it is clearly stated that the adhaan in which this phrase appears is called adhaan salaat al-subh, adhaan al-fajr, etc. These phrases indicate that this adhaan should come after the time for the prayer begins and the adhaan that is given at the end of the night comes before the time for prayer begins. These ahaadeeth include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, teach me the Sunnah of adhaan.” He wiped the front of my head and said: “Say Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great)… And if it is Fajr prayer, then say: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to another, similar report, it says: “Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep) in the first adhaan of dawn.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood, 501; al-Nasaa’i, 633; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to another report narrated by Abu Dawood (504) from Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him): He used to say in Fajr: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep). Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: It is Sunnah for the muezzin, after saying Hayya ‘ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), to say: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep)” twice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was narrated by al-Daaraqutni (90), Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh and al-Bayhaqi in his Sunan (1/423), and he said: its isnaad is saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by al-Daraaqutni and al-Tahhaawi (1/82) via Hushaym from Ibn ‘Awn with the wording: In the adhaan for Fajr prayer, when the muezzin said: Hayya ‘ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), he said: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep),” twice. This version was narrated by Ibn al-Sakan who classed it as saheeh, as it says in al-Talkhees, 3/148&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 132&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth show that this phrase appears in the adhaan for Fajr prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The adhaan which is the call to prayer is that which comes after the time for the prayer has begun, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the time for prayer begins, then let one of you give the adhaan for you.” Agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the adhaan which comes at the end of the night, this is not an adhaan for Fajr prayer as such, rather it is done “so that the one who is praying qiyaam may go back and the one who is asleep may wake up”, as is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in al-Saheehayn. Thus it is clear that the phrase which appears in the adhaan which comes after the time for the prayer begins is not a bid’ah (innovation), rather it is Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is the reason why the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to say al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, is not done in the first adhaan for Fajr, as is mentioned in Sunan al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Khuzaymah and al-Bayhaqi?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yes, the this phrase should be mentioned in the first adhaan of Fajr, in accordance with the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is clear from the hadeeth that it is the adhaan that is done when the true dawn comes, and it is called ‘first’ in relation to the iqaamah, which is an adhaan according to sharee’ah, as it says in the hadeeth, “Between every two calls (adhaanayn) there should be a prayer.” The word adhaan here does not refer to the call that is given before the appearance of the true dawn. That call is prescribed in order to wake those who are asleep and so that those who are praying qiyaam may go back. It is not a call to announce the Fajr prayer. Whoever studies the ahaadeeth about this phrase will see clearly that they refer to the adhaan given to announce the time of Fajr, not the adhaan which is given at night just before dawn. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 6/63&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on the refutation of those who say that this phrase should be said in the adhaan which comes before the time for the prayer begins, please see al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/61-64&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the view of your teacher, that this phrase is comparing sleep with Fajr prayer, this is not correct, because this phrase is stating that prayer is better than sleep and thus encouraging the sleeper to stop sleeping and get up to do something that is better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Will watching haraam soap operas and plucking the eyebrows form an impediment to the intercession of the intercessors on the Day of Resurrection?",
      "question": "<p>Briefly, I read your fatwa having to do with intercession (21672), in which it says that there are some people whose intercession will not be accepted, and I immediately wondered whether I would be one of these people or not?</p>\n<p>Please note that, praise be to Allah, I pray, but sometimes I pray and sometimes I do not, then I go back to praying, then I stop again, and so on. But this time in sha Allah I will be one of those who persist in it. I do not listen to music, praise be to Allah. I watch Turkish soap operas, but I do not look at provocative scenes. But my fear is that I may be cursed because of my eyebrows, because I pluck my eyebrows and I remove excess hair from them. Will this form an impediment to the intercession of Ahl al-Bayt and of Sayyiduna Muhammad, or the mercy of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide you and enable you to offer the prescribed prayers regularly and not to slacken in that at all, and to enable you to do that in the manner with which He is pleased, for prayer is very important, to such an extent that it is the thing that stands between a person and disbelief (kufr), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Between disbelief and faith there stands giving up the prayer.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2618); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. It is also narrated by Muslim (82) as follows: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.”</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (429) narrated that Abu’d-Darda’ said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are five things; whoever does them with faith will enter Paradise: whoever regularly offers the five daily prayers with their wudoo’, bowing, and prostration, and offers them on time; fasts Ramadan; goes on pilgrimage to the House if he is able to do so; gives zakaah willingly and happily; and fulfils trusts.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Watching soap operas and movies is haraam and is not permissible. Claiming that you do not look at provocative scenes indicates that these productions may contain provocative and haraam scenes, so it is not permissible for a Muslim, man or woman, to expose himself or herself to that which will provoke temptation and cause them to fall into haraam, especially since most of what is shown in movies and other productions inevitably contains things that are contrary to Islam, such as uncovering ‘awrahs and listening to music, as well as being a waste of time in worthless pursuits. For further discussion of the prohibition on watching movies and other productions, and the negative impact they have on people’s beliefs and morals, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/125535\">125535</a>.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Cutting the hair of the eyebrows, or trimming it by cutting the edges, shaving them or plucking them for the purpose of beautification is haraam, because that is changing the creation of Allah and following the Shaytaan in his deceit of man and instructing him to change the creation of Allah.</p>\n<p>For more information on that, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2162\">2162</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22393\">22393</a>.</p>\n<p>With regard to cutting the hair between the eyebrows and excess hair that may be bothersome, such as that which may fall over the eyes and block the vision, that is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The namas that is mentioned in the hadith refers to plucking the hair and thinning it. As for merely removing excess hair so that it does not block one’s vision or in order to avoid harm it may cause by falling onto the eye, there is no doubt that this is permissible.</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (81/31)</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3928\">3928</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9037\">9037</a></p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>You should not entertain the notion that you are cursed because of what you have fallen into. Yes, the one who plucks the eyebrows or stops praying is exposed to that risk and deserves that because of his or her action, unless he is forgiven. But what you should do, and what makes sense for you to do, is to hasten to give up that which may bring the curse or the wrath of Allah upon the one who does it, and you should hasten to correct any faults you may have, and make up for any shortcomings you may have, whilst also repenting sincerely to Allah from what you have done in the past, and hastening to do good.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36674\">36674</a>.</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>Intercession on the Day of Resurrection will be of avail to whomever Allah wills of those who committed sins, acts of disobedience and major sins, among the people who affirmed His Oneness. We cannot be certain that intercession will be withheld from anyone except those who disbelieved and ascribed partners to Allah. There may be some sinners among those who affirmed Allah’s Oneness who will enter Hell for their sins until Allah brings them forth from it when they have been cleansed from their sins.</p>\n<p>Intercession for those who committed sins and acts of disobedience will not only be granted to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather the Prophets, the martyrs, the scholars, the righteous and the angels will also have a share of intercession.</p>\n<p>Please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21672\">21672</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/26259\">26259</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on that, we cannot definitively say that plucking the eyebrows or other actions that may result in a curse or punishment – Allah forbid – will rule out the intercession of those who intercede on the Day of Resurrection, whether that is the intercession of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or the intercession of others such as the righteous, good people of Ahl al-Bayt or others, especially since the Prophet&nbsp; (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “My intercession will be for those among my ummah who committed major sins.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood (4739); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood</p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>What you should do, instead of making yourself anxious, doubtful and confused, and perhaps despair of the mercy of Allah or of attaining intercession, is to hasten to put things right between you and your Lord, think positively of Him, and turn to Him in sincere repentance, in the hope that He may turn your bad deeds into good deeds.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Later on, he feels he should give out this money to complete the conditions for his repentance (tawba).</p>\n<div>However, there are two problems :</div>\n<div>1- He cannot calculate the exact amount of all the money</div>\n<div>he previously obtained from bank interests.</div>\n<div>2- The savings this person has now, are surely less than what</div>\n<div>he obtained from bank interest over the years.</div>\n<div>Given the above, please answer the following questions :</div>\n<div>1- Is it a condition of this person's tawba to give out the exact equivalent of all the money he received from bank interest ?</div>\n<div>2- If the answer to the first question is 'yes', then must he immediately give out any amounts as they become available (after providing basic needs for himself and his family) ?</div>\n<div>i.e can this person buy things that are not strictly necessities ('Darooriyyaat' i.e. shelter, food, clothes, medicine, transportation) but that are still important ('haajaat', e.g. computer) ?</div>\n<div>3- If the answer to the second part of the previous question is 'no', can this person perform hajj, before giving out the equivalent of this bank interest money, with any amounts that become available ?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>Those who eat riba (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan, leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like riba, whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire they will abide therein.</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:275]</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said concerning the phrase So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past: This means: whoever hears that Allah has forbidden riba should stop as soon as this ruling reaches him, but he can keep whatever he had received before, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Allah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95]. Similarly, on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: All riba owing from the time of Jaahiliyyah is under these two feet of mine (when he abolished everything that was owed to the usurers except their capital), he did not command them to return the extra money they had received during the time of Jaahiliyyah. (The phrase) (Allah) has forgiven what is past is akin to the phrase his case is for Allah (to judge). Saeed ibn Jubayr and al-Saddi said: Shall not be punished for his past (means) for what he used to consume of riba before it was prohibited.</p>\n<p>(Tafseer Ibn Katheer; the material in brackets has been added for the purpose of clarification).</p>\n<p>On the basis of the above, you do not have to repay the interest which you received before you found out that it is haram, but whatever you have received since then must be repaid if you still have it. If it has become mixed with your own money and you do not know the amount, then try to estimate what you think is most likely, and pay that amount.</p>\n<p>For more information please see Questions # <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/824\">824</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1606\">1606</a>.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to accept our repentance.

The wisdom behind that is that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, only sent revelation to the Prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) through the angels, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“He sends down the angels, with the inspiration of His command, upon whom He wills of His servants”</p>\n<p>[an-Nahl 16:2]</p>\n<p>“The Trustworthy Spirit [Jibreel] has brought it down</p>\n<p>Upon your heart, [O Muhammad] - that you may be of the warners -”</p>\n<p>[ash-Shu‘araa’ 26:193-194].</p>\n<p>As it is established that the revelation of Allah, may He be exalted, only reached humanity through the angels, then the angels are the intermediaries between Allah, may He be exalted, and humanity. It is for this reason that the angels are mentioned second in this list.</p>\n<p>For this reason also, “Allah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:18].</p>\n<p>The third in this list is the Books, which refers to the revelation that the angel brought from Allah, may He be exalted, and delivered to humanity. So the angel is mentioned before the books, and the books are mentioned after that for this reason.</p>\n<p>The fourth in this list is the Messengers, who are the ones who received the light of revelation from the angels. For this reason, the messengers are listed in fourth place.</p>\n<p>This was discussed by ar-Raazi in at-Tafseer (7/108); see also: Haashiyat Zaadah ‘ala al-Baydaawi (2/694).</p>\n<p>At-Teebi said: The angel is mentioned before the Book and the Messengers, following the sequence of events in reality, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent the angel with the book to the Messenger.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh al-Mishkaat (2/425).</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, this comes under the heading of subtle points of knowledge, and is not one of the pillars or foundations on which any beliefs or rulings are built.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best</p>\n",
