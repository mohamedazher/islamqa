      "question": "<p>I am a religiously-committed lawyer, praise be to Allah. I wanted to ask how I can learn sharia-based laws. What I mean is that I want to learn Islamic criminal law, Islamic commercial law, and Islamic civil law. Is there a place that teaches these fields to Muslim lawyers? How can the Muslim lawyer serve his ummah? What is your advice to me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\tFirstly:</p>\n<p>\tThe real nature of the lawyer’s \trole is to represent someone in disputes when cases are taken to court in \torder to ward off injustice or attain rights and dues. The basic principle \tregarding this type of representation is that it is permissible.</p>\n<p>\tIbn Qattaan (may Allah have \tmercy on him) said: </p>\n<p>\tThe scholars are unanimously \tagreed that representing someone in disputes and pursuing rights in the \tpresence of the one being represented and with the consent of the opponent, \twhen the person represented is present, is permissible.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from al-Iqnaa‘ \t(2/156).</p>\n<p>\tShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz \t(may Allah have mercy on him) said: </p>\n<p>\tThe lawyer is a person’s \trepresentative in a dispute. This type of representation was known at the \ttime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and up until \tthe present day. There is nothing wrong with this kind of representation, \tbut calling the one who does this a lawyer is something new. </p>\n<p>\tIf the lawyer fears Allah and \tdoes not defend his client in wrongdoing or lying, then there is nothing \twrong with it.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Fataawa Noor \t‘ala ad-Darb (19/231).</p>\n<p>\tWhat is required of the lawyer \tis to defend one who is in the right. As for one who is in the wrong or has \tno right to a claim, it is not permissible to support him in his falsehood.</p>\n<p>\tAllah, may He be exalted, says \t(interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“And \tcooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and \taggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Maa’idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>\t“<a>And \tdo not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves</a>.\t<a>Indeed, Allah loves not one who is a habitually \tsinful deceiver</a>”</p>\n<p>\t[an-Nisa’ 4:107].</p>\n<p>\tShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di \t(may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\t“And do not argue on behalf \tof those who deceive themselves” in the sense of committing offences \tagainst their own souls. That includes the prohibition on speaking on behalf \tof one who has committed sin for which the punishment is now due, whether it \tis a h@add punishment (specified in sharia) or a ta‘zeer punishment (a \tdisciplinary punishment meted out at the judge’s discretion). So he should \tnot plead on his behalf by trying to prove that he did not do it, or try to \tward off the resulting punishment as dictated by sharia.</p>\n<p>\t“Indeed, Allah loves not one who is a \thabitually sinful deceiver” that is, one who is habitually treacherous \tand sinful. Stating that Allah does not love someone implies the opposite, \twhich is that He hates such a person. This is like the reason why what is \tmentioned above should not be done.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di \t(p. 200)</p>\n<p>\tIt was narrated that Yahya ibn \tRaashid said: We sat waiting for ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar and he came out to us, \tand sat down and said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \tof Allah be upon him) say: “If a person’s intercession prevents one of the \thadd punishments of Allah (from being carried out), then he has opposed \tAllah. The one who argues for a false case knowingly will remain subject to \tthe wrath of Allah until he gives it up. If a person says something of a \tbeliever that is not true, Allah will cause him to dwell in the mud of \tkhabaal (the juice of the people of Hell) until he retracts what he said.”</p>\n<p>\tClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani \tin as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (1/798).</p>\n<p>\tShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may \tAllah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tThe practice of law [as a \tlawyer] refers to the representation of a man so as to prove his case \tagainst his opponent; this is divided into two categories. The first is that \tin which the lawyer seeks to prove a case based on true facts and to protect \tthe rights of the one whom he represents. There is nothing wrong with doing \tthat, because all it is, is one person representing another in return for a \tfee, and representing someone in return for a fee is permissible and there \tis nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<p>\tThe second category of \tpractising law refers to when the lawyer wants to prove a case whether \trightly or wrongly. It is not permissible to do this, because in that case \tthe lawyer will be defending any case, regardless of whether it is valid or \tfalse. This is haraam; rather what the Muslim is required to do, if he sees \tthat his brother’s case is based on falsehood, is to advise him and not \tagree to represent him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \tupon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil, let him change it with his \thand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking \tout); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that \tit is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” </p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Fataawa Noor \t‘ala ad-Darb (11/609-610).</p>\n<p>\tThe Muslim lawyer who practices \this profession on the basis of clear proof and in accordance with Islamic \trulings, and with a sound intention, advising the one whom he represents to \tfear Allah, may He be exalted, and not to demand that to which they have no \tright, and only to pursue what is permissible to them according to Islamic \tteachings, and to acknowledge people’s rights and to be truthful in their \tstatements, words and testimonies, and tells him that fearing Allah, may He \tbe exalted, is the way to a good life in this world and the hereafter, and \tto be kind to those of the poor and weak whose rights are neglected – the \tlawyer who adheres to all of that is doing an important job in rectifying \tsociety.</p>\n<p>\tSecondly: </p>\n<p>\tAs for Islamic studies in your \tspecialty, they are available in Islamic universities and in some colleges \tin which there are Islamic specialties.</p>\n<p>\tIn your country, there is the \tCollege of Sharia and Law in al-Azhar University; you can benefit from its \tcurricula, and if you cannot study there, there are also Islamic sharia \tdepartments in colleges of law and the Centre of Islamic Economics in al-Azhar \tUniversity.</p>\n<p>\tOne of the useful books that we \tcan recommend to you is: at-Tashree‘ al-Jinaa’i al-Islami: Muqaaranan \tbi’l-Qanoon al-Wad‘i by ‘Abd al-Qaadir ‘Awdah.</p>\n<p>\tYou could also benefit from \tMusannafah an-Nuzum al-Islamiyyah by Mustafa Kamaal Wasfi.</p>\n<p>\tWhatever the case, by \tcontinuing to read and study, asking questions of specialists in your \tcountry, you will come to know of books and curricula that will help you to \tachieve your goal.</p>\n<p>\tRegarding the legal profession \tand some of its etiquette, and other issues connected to it, we advise you \tto read the book al-Muhaamaah by Shaykh Mashhoor Hasan Salmaan, which \tyou will find on the following link:</p>\n<p>\t\t<a href=\"http://majles.alukah.net/t66552\">\thttp://majles.alukah.net/t66552</a></p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows best.    </p>\n",

      "title": "He owns an café in which men and women mix",
      "question": "<p>A man owns a high-quality café which has a mixed clientele of men and women. He feels uneasy because of this mixing and fears that the income from this café may come under the heading of things which are forbidden or are doubtful and therefore disallowed in sharee’ah, even though he has told his employees not to sell anything that is forbidden in sharee’ah, such as cigarettes, and he has forbidden his customers to do anything that goes against Islamic etiquette. We would like you to please shed some light on this issue by quoting some verses of Qur’aan and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that we may find some peace of mind and avoid falling into sin, and we may meet our Lord when He is pleased with us. We hope that the answer will be detailed.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    The owner of this café has done well by refusing to sell     forbidden substances in his café, such as refusing to sell cigarettes and     refusing to allow people to do things that go against Islamic etiquette. May     Allaah reward him with good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But it remains for him to forbid mixing, because of the evil     and temptation that it involves. The Qur’aan and Sunnah indicate that mixing     is haraam. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask     them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their     hearts”</p>\n<p>    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]</p>\n<p>    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting     on this verse: i.e., just as it is forbidden for you to enter upon them, it     is also forbidden for you to look at them at all; even if one of you has a     need to ask them for anything, he should not look at them or ask of them     except from behind a screen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This verse     indicates that Allaah has given permission to ask of them from behind a     screen in the case of necessity, or when consulting them about some matter.     This meaning includes all women, because the basic principle of sharee’ah is     that the whole of a woman is ‘awrah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women.     If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in     whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should     be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”</p>\n<p>    [al-Ahzaab 33:32]</p>\n<p>    If there is this warning against being soft of speech lest     the one in whose heart is a disease be moved with desire, then what about     men sitting with women who are clothed yet naked, who go astray and lead     others astray, chatting and laughing together, and looking at one another?     What fitnah can be greater than that? What heart can remain free of sickness     when this is the case?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     took care to prevent men mixing with women even in the dearest spots on     earth to Allaah, namely the mosques, when he separated the rows of men and     women, and he stayed for a while after saying the salaam so that the women     could depart, and he designated a door of the mosque specifically for women.     The evidence for that is as flows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – It was narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased     with her) said: When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) had said the salaam, the women would get up and leave     when they had said the salaam, and he would stay for a while before getting     up to leave. Ibn Shihaab said: I think – and Allaah knows best – that he     stayed a while so that the women could disperse before the men got up to     leave. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 793.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased     with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) said: “Why don’t we leave this door for the women?” Naafi’     said: Ibn ‘Umar never entered through that door until he died. Narrated by     Abu Dawood, 462; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased     with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “The best rows for men are the first ones and the worst are the last,     and the best rows for women are the last ones and the worst are the first.”     Narrated by Muslim, 664.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is among the greatest evidence that Islam forbids     mixing. The further away the men are from the women’s rows the better, and     the further away the women are from the men’s rows the better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If these precautions are to be taken in the mosque which is a     pure place of worship, then taking them in other places is undoubtedly more     important.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    4 – It was narrated from Abu Usayd al-Ansaari that he heard     the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     say, when he was outside the mosque and the men were mixing with the women     in the road. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said to the women: “Move aside, for you have no right to walk in     the middle of the road; you should walk at the sides of the road.” Then a     woman would walk so close to the walls that her garment would catch on the     wall because she walked so close to it.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 5272;     classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more details on the dangers of mixing, please see the     answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/1200\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">1200</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Since mixing is haraam, the owner of this café is committing     sin by allowing it and refraining from denouncing it, and by helping these     people to commit sin by providing a place for them where they can disobey     Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What he has to do is to fear Allaah and not help to spread     evil and corruption among the believers. He should be keen to make his food     good (i.e., from halaal sources), for “every body that is nourished on     haraam, the Fire is more befitting for it,” as the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. Narrated by al-Tabaraani and Abu     Na’eem from Abu Bakr; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’,     no. 4519.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Another version was narrated from Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah: “No flesh     grows that is nourished by haraam but the Fire is more befitting for it.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If he can prevent mixing, then this is what he must do, or     else he can restrict the café to men only. Otherwise he should look for     other, permissible work. Whoever gives up a thing for the sake of Allaah,     Allaah will compensate him with something better than it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He     will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</p>\n<p>    3.&nbsp;And He will provide him from (sources) he never could     imagine”</p>\n<p>    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A married woman commits adultery, then she repented but the guilt of the act is haunting her. She is now thinking about suicide. What should be done and what is your advice?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The believer sees his sin as a mountain beneath which he is sitting and which he fears may fall down upon him. The rebellious person sees his sin as a fly which passes in front of his nose and he swats it away\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6308)</div>\n<p>This woman's overwhelming sense of the burden of her sin is a sign of faith. We offer her the following advice:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>She should examine her divorce from her first husband to make sure that it is sound according to sharee'ah (Islamic law), whether it took the form of talaaq (male-instigated divorce) or khul' (female-instigated divorce).</li>\n<li>She should make sure that her marriage contract to the second man is also sound, because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery is not valid unless they have repented (see questions # <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/649\" target=\"_blank\">649</a> ); if the contract is found not to be valid, it must be repeated.</li>\n<li>If this woman is sincere in her repentance towards Allah, regrets what she did and is determined never to do it again, Allah will forgive all her sins, no matter how great they were, so she should not despair of the mercy of Allah, for no one despairs of Allah's Mercy, except the people who disbelieve, and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are astray?</li>\n<li>She should hasten to do many good deeds, to expiate for her sin, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And perform al-salaat (the prayer) at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds\" [Hud 11:114]</li>\n<li>She should resume a pure Islamic life, based on purity and chastity. Suicide is not a solution at all, as it is one of the most grievous of major sins, and will only increase the punishment of the one who does it. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Whoever throws himself down from a high mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down from a mountain in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever takes poison and kills himself will be taking poison in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever kills himself with a weapon (literally, iron) will be holding it in his hand and stabbing himself in the stomach in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5778)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to help this woman to repent sincerely, to forgive her sins and to include her in His Mercy, for He is the All-hearing Who answers prayers.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>cause i am bit confused regarding this matter so what does shia's believe that hazrat \"ali\" is a first caliphate and we sunnis say that hazrat\"abbubakar \" is the first caliphate.so u better tell who is the first caliphate and what is the that will which prophet \"mohammed\"(peace be upon him) want to give to his kinsmen and what is the event take place at ghadeer .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The      first khaleefah who succeeded the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and      blessings of Allaah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be      pleased with him), according to the consensus of the respected scholars,      because of the consensus of the Sahaabah who all gave their bay’ah      (allegiance) to him. This was after an initial dispute between the      Muhaajireen and Ansaar, then the Ansaar were convinced and gave their      bay’ah to Abu Bakr, and they did not differ amongst themselves, and they      did not hesitate in making a choice between Abu Bakr and ‘Ali (may      Allaah be pleased with them both). None of the Sahaabah asked to give      bay’ah to ‘Ali after Abu Bakr and before ‘Umar (may Allaah be      pleased with him), and no one asked to give bay’ah to ‘Ali after      ‘Umar – may Allaah be pleased with them all. The fitnah and      differences arose because of the murder of ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be      pleased with him). The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted      for their worldly affairs the one whom the Messenger of Allaah had      accepted for their religious affairs, the one who had acted as the deputy      of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon      him) in leading the prayers [when he was unable to do so – i.e., Abu      Bakr].</p>\n<p>With      regard to what happened at Ghadeer: Ghadeer is the name of a well in a      place between Makkah and Madeenah which is called Khum. The hadeeth was      narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh      (no. 2408) from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up and addressed us one      day at a well called Khum, between Makkah and Madeenah. He praised Allaah      and exhorted and reminded us. Then he said: ‘I am leaving among you two      important things: the first of which is the Book of Allaah’ – and he      urged us to adhere to the Book of Allaah, then he said: ‘And the people      of my household (ahl bayti).      I remind you of Allaah with regard to the people of my household, I remind      you of Allaah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of      Allaah with regard to the people of my household.’” Zayd said: his      wives are among the people of his household, but the people of his      household who are forbidden to receive sadaqah (charity) after his death      are the family of ‘Ali, the family of ‘Aqeel, the family of Ja’far      and the family of ‘Abbaas. All of these are forbidden to receive      sadaqah.” [abbreviated version].</p>\n<p>                  His advice concerning the people of his household has to do with honouring      and respecting them, and not exposing them to abuse or annoyance. This      does not mean that they are to be given preference over others who are      known through the texts to be more virtuous than them, such as Abu Bakr,      ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with them all).</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on praying on prayer mats? What is the ruling on putting a prayer mat in the mosque for the imam to pray on? Is this bid`ah? May Allah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Offering_prayer_on_a_prayer_mat\">Offering prayer on a prayer mat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Cases_where_it_is_not_permissible_to_pray_on_carpets\">Cases where it is not permissible to pray on carpets</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"Offering_prayer_on_a_prayer_mat\">Offering prayer on a prayer mat</span></h3>\n<p>Offering prayer on a prayer mat is permissible in principle. Al-Bukhari (379) and Muslim (513) narrated that Maymunah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray on a khumrah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A khumrah is a small mat made of palm leaves that is big enough for the face, on which a worshipper may prostrate to protect himself from the heat or coldness of the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Khattabi favoured the view that the khumrah may be bigger than that, and he quoted as evidence the report narrated by Abu Dawud (5247) from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: A mouse came and started dragging the wick of the lamp and threw it in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), on the khumrah on which he was sitting, and it burned an area the size of a dirham… (This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 4369.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: “This clearly shows that the word khumrah may apply to a large mat. This was also stated in al-Nihayah.”&nbsp;(See Fath al-Bari, 333)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shawkani said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This hadith indicates that there is nothing wrong with praying on a mat, regardless of whether it is made of rags, palm leaves or anything else, whether it is small or big, like a mat or carpet, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed on mats, carpets and animal pelts.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cases_where_it_is_not_permissible_to_pray_on_carpets\">Cases where it is not permissible to pray on carpets</span></h3>\n<p>But there may be some reasons why it is not permissible to pray on carpets and similar things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the carpet contains images of animate beings; in which case it is haram to keep them and the images must be blotted out. Please see question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12422\" target=\"_blank\">12422</a> .&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If the carpet has decorations and patterns that attract the attention of the worshipper and distract him from his prayer; praying on such carpets is makruh.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to pictures of inanimate objects such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plants, trees, houses and so on, so long as there are no images of living beings in or around them, these are permissible, but praying on them is makruh because they distract the worshipper and detract from his proper focus and humility (khushu’) in prayer, but his prayer is still valid.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 6/180)</p>\n<p>They also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The mosques are the houses of Allah, built for the establishment of prayer and the glorification of Allah and the fear of Allah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patterns and decorations in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50407\" target=\"_blank\">furnishings</a> and on the walls of the mosques are things that distract the heart from the remembrance of Allah and take away much of the worshippers’ proper focus and humility. Hence they were regarded as makruh by many of the salaf. So the Muslims should avoid that in their mosques and strive to make their worship perfect by keeping distractions away from the places in which they seek to draw close to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, hoping to increase their reward. But with regard to praying (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/90097\" target=\"_blank\">on carpets decorated with such patterns</a> ), it is valid.”&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If praying on the rug is done in order to avoid praying on the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (2036) narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We observed i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the middle ten days of Ramadan, and we came out on the morning of the twentieth. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the morning of the twentieth and said: “I was shown Laylat al-Qadr but then I was made to forget it, so seek it in the last ten nights, on the odd-numbered nights. I saw that I was prostrating in water and mud. Whoever was observing i’tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), let him go back.” So the people went back to the mosque, and we did not see any trace of a cloud in the sky. Then a cloud came and it rained, and the iqamah for prayer was given, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated in mud and water until we saw the marks of mud on the tip of his nose and his face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by Muslim (1167): “And his forehead was covered with mud and water.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith points to the humility of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as he prostrated on water and mud, and he did not order that something be brought for him to prostrate on.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If praying on the rug is done to avoid praying on the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/213229\" target=\"_blank\">carpets</a> that are spread for all the people in the mosque, or if a person does that to be on the safe side because there may be some impurity (najasah) on the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to those who suffer from extreme waswasah (whispers from the Shaytan), they do not pray on the ground or on the carpets spread out for everyone on the ground, rather they pray on a rug or something similar…” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/177)&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a man seeks to pray on the rug because he thinks that it is essential to have a rug just for prayer and that he has to pray on something whether he is at home or in the mosque. Many people only ever pray on the rug even if the house is carpeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Praying on rugs, in the sense that the worshipper insists on that – this was not the way of the salaf, the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth at the time of the Messenger of Allah. Rather they used to pray on the ground in his mosque, and none of them had a rug that was used just for prayer. It was narrated that when ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi came to Madinah he spread out a rug, and Malik ordered that it be taken away. It was said to him, “He is ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi.” Malik said, “Do you not know that spreading a rug in our mosque is bid’ah (an innovation)?”’ (&nbsp;Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/163)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The same applies to the practice in many mosques of having a rug that is just for the imam, which is set out for him to pray on, even though the mosque is carpeted. Why is he distinguished from the other worshippers??</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not appropriate because there is no need for it, and because that may make him feel somewhat superior to the people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The point is that putting down rugs in a carpeted mosque is a bid`ah unless there is a reason for that, such as it being very cold, or the floor being rough or the first carpet being impure or filthy, and so on.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

One of us said, ‘We see that you appear to be in high spirits today.’ He said, ‘Yes, praise be to Allah.’ Then the people spoke about riches.

This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, no. 1741)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Aims_of_playing_sports_in_Islam\">Aims of playing sports in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>The Muslim’s aim in playing sports should be to strengthen himself to do acts of worship and to support the religion of Allah, to defend His sacred limits and to protect the honour of the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If that is not the case, then at the very least he should aim to earn himself a living in this world, protect himself from enemies or use his physical strength to earn a living, so that it will be a means of him eating from what he earns with his own hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Miqdam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man eats better food than the one who earns it with his own hands. The Prophet of Allah Dawud (peace be upon him) used to eat from what he earned with his own hands.&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1966)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For one of you to chop wood and carry it on his back is better for him than asking (begging) from anyone who will either give him something or refuse to give him anything.”&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1968; Muslim, 1042)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_boxing_haram\">Is boxing haram?</span></h3>\n<p>This is with regard to permissible kinds of sports. But from what we see nowadays, most sports have gone beyond that and are no longer permissible; they have become haram, especially <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10427\" target=\"_blank\">boxing</a> which is the worst of sports, for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It involves attacking the face, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you has a fight with his brother, let him avoid the face.”&nbsp;(Al-Bukhari, 2560; Muslim, 2612). This game is based on hitting the face of one's opponent with the strongest blow the boxer can muster.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It is a waste of time. Allah has bestowed many blessings upon the Muslim, and He will question him about them on the Day of Resurrection. But people think little of these blessings and waste many of them such as good health and free time. One of the things that Allah will question the Muslim about on the Day when he meets Him will be his youth and what he did with it, and his life and how he spent it. What will this man say who spent his youth and his life training to fight people and wrestle with them and box with them in order to gain a title or win a prize?&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:</p>\n<p>“If a person should not waste his money on things that are of no benefit, it is even more important that he not waste his time, because time is more precious than money, and because the fact that the young and the not-so-young waste their time on these sorts of games that are of no benefit to them is something that is very unfortunate and regrettable.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/435)&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It is a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3895\" target=\"_blank\">harmful sport</a> which can lead to irreparable damage, and Allah has forbidden us to harm our bodies, which He has commanded us to preserve and protect.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) decreed that there should be no harm or reciprocation of harm. (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2340; Ahmad, 21714; this hadith was classed as sahih by Imam Ahmad and al-Hakim, and as hasan by Ibn al-Salah)&nbsp;(See Khalasat al-Badr al-Munir, by Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 2/438)</p>\n<p>Because of your practising this sport, you know that there are many boxers who have been permanently injured, especially with damage to the brain and nerves. &nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It involves wasting money and wasting people’s time with something that is of no benefit. Instead of being wasted on this useless entertainment, that money could have been spent on charitable causes. How many millions are wasted that could have been spent on feeding the hungry, building a mosque, opening a school or other good works?&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">These sports – including boxing – have become an excuse for tribalism and nationalism. Sport, as it exists nowadays, has divided people and made people love or hate one another on the basis of the victory or defeat of a team.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It involves uncovering the ‘awrah, even if you do not do that, your opponent will. The man's ‘awrah is from the navel to the knee, as was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Similarly, it involves uncovering of the spectators’ ‘awrahs, both men and women. This is something that you cannot ward off or even denounce them for.</p>\n<p>You say in your question that you will not fight Muslims, but will the people who organize the matches allow you that? I don’t think so, and you know better than we do.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Boxing_for_Islam_Possible\">Boxing for Islam: Possible?</span></h3>\n<p>These fights are not held for the sake of religion, and they are not based on that. When people watch a fight, they do not think that this is a fight between Islam and disbelief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, when you fight, you will be fighting in the name of the country where you live, or which has given you its nationality; they will not allow you to fight in the name of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And even if your opponent is a disbeliever, he may be from among the people with whom there is peace (ahl al-silm), not those who are in a state of war with the Muslims (ahl al-harb), so what right do you have to raise your hand against a man who is at peace with us?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this sport is one of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22305\" target=\"_blank\">haraam games</a> that causes more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Boxing_for_jihad\">Boxing for jihad</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to your saying that you intend to go for jihad one day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are beautiful words, even if boxing is haram. You can strengthen your body by doing other sports that are not haram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I took some abortion pills to open the cervix of the uterus in preparation for a surgery, but I was not pregnant; that was only for the surgical procedure. Some bleeding occurred; it was spotting in the beginning, then the amount increased. What should I do about my prayer until the time of the procedure? If bleeding occurs after the surgery, should I pray or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is well-known that taking such pills may cause disruption in a woman’s menstrual cycle, causing the period to come earlier than usual, or increasing the number of days it lasts.</p>\n<p>A number of scholars favour the view that a woman should look at the blood that is emitted because of these pills:</p>\n<p>If it has the characteristics of menstrual blood, such as if it is deep red and thick, with a characteristic smell, then it is menstrual blood and therefore she cannot pray, fast or have intercourse.</p>\n<p>But if it is light red with no smell, then it is simply bleeding, and comes under the rulings on istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding]. In that case, the woman should wash the blood from herself, do wudoo’ and pray, and she should wear sanitary pads to prevent the blood spreading.</p>\n<p>If the menses is stopped by means of pills or otherwise, then the woman is deemed to be taahir [pure; free of menses] as a result of that; by the same token, menstrual bleeding that occurs as a result of taking pills means that she is indeed menstruating.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a breast-feeding woman whose menses was slow in resuming, so she took medicine to bring about menstruation, and she had three periods or menstrual cycles. She was recently divorced; has her ‘iddah ended or not?</p>\n<p>He replied: Yes, if her regular menses occurred as a result of that, then it is to be counted as such [and she has completed her ‘iddah thereby]. Similarly, if she took medicine to stop her menses, or to increase the time between one period and the next, then she becomes pure thereby; and if she got hungry or tired or something else happened that affected her physically and caused her to bleed, then this is to be regarded as menses.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (34/23, 24).</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked: Nowadays, women use artificial methods of contraception, such as pills and IUDs, and any doctor will agree to insert an IUD or prescribe pills, and before that he will give the woman two pills to confirm that she is not pregnant, after which she has to bleed if there is no pregnancy.</p>\n<p>My question is: with regard to this bleeding that comes within these few days, does it come under the same ruling as menstrual bleeding, with regard to not praying or fasting or having intercourse? Please note that the duration of this bleeding is not at the same time as her regular menses.</p>\n<p>Similarly, after having an IUD inserted or using pills, for some women the pattern of the menstrual cycle changes, and it may increase suddenly after using contraception, to the extent that some of them do not become pure for more than a week out of the month; the bleeding lasts for three consecutive weeks, and the blood in this case is the same as the blood that comes during menses. The same may also apply to the bleeding that occurs when taking two pills to confirm that there is no pregnancy, as mentioned in the previous question.</p>\n<p>My question here is: what is the ruling on the woman during this three-week period? Is it the same as the ruling on menses? Or should she follow what was her usual cycle before taking that contraceptive, regardless of whether her period was usually one week or ten days?</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>If the bleeding that occurred after taking the two pills was the same as the woman’s usual menses, then this blood is menses, and at that time she should stop fasting and praying. But if it was otherwise, then it is not regarded as menstrual blood that means that she cannot fast, pray or have intercourse, because it only happened as a result of taking the pills.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (5/402).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about menses that results from taking pills, and he said:</p>\n<p>The woman should ask the doctor; if he says that this is menses, then it is menses, and if he says that this is excretions caused by those pills, then it is not menses.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa wa Duroos al-Haram al-Makki, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (2/284).</p>\n<p>The same ruling applies to bleeding that occurs after the surgery. It should also be looked at, and if it appears to be menstrual bleeding, then you should stop praying and fasting, but if it does not appear to be menstrual bleeding, then you are like one who is experiencing istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding).</p>\n<p>It should be noted that any bleeding that lasts beyond fifteen days of the month is not regarded as menses, and it comes under the rulings on istihaadah, according to the majority of scholars.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/67777\">67777</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

(End quote from <em>Kashshaf Al-Qina`</em>, 5/189).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wife whose husband is harming her by having intercourse too often may come to some agreement with her husband concerning a specific number that she can put up with, and if he does more to such an extent that it is harmful to her, then she has the right to refer the matter to the judge, who may determine a specific number and oblige both husband and wife to adhere to that.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Resorting_to_masturbation_if_the_wife_is_not_interested\"><strong>Resorting to masturbation if the wife is not interested?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13436\" target=\"_blank\">Masturbation</a> is prohibited, because of evidence that we have quoted in the answer to question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/329\" target=\"_blank\">329</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/329\" target=\"_blank\">There is no sin if the husband is masturbated by his wife’s hand</a> , because it is permissible for him to enjoy her; the same applies if he ejaculates outside the vagina, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>{And they who guard their private parts. Except from their wives or those their right hands possess,1 for indeed, they will not be blamed} [Al-Mu’minun 23:5-6] &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the wife will be harmed by intercourse, she will not be harmed if her husband enjoys her in other ways, so she has to allow him to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Creating_a_harmonious_relationship_between_spouses_in_Islam\">Creating a harmonious relationship between spouses in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>Both spouses have to tackle this problem in a kind, loving and frank manner; and each of them should understand the rights and duties that they have, because most marital problems stem from ignorance of that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some husbands are keen to satisfy their own desires, and they hasten to do that without caring about their wives or paying attention to their right to pleasure, so the wife finds no enjoyment in it and is put off by it, and it becomes a problem and a burden for her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence we say, strive to create love and affection between you and your wife; pay attention to her situation and understand her feelings; avoid that which will harm her or hurt her. Tell her of the Shar`i ruling concerning this issue and help her to follow it, and do not put her off, and be moderate in your approach, and you will get what you want. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>May Allah help us and you to obey Him and seek His pleasure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/193320\" target=\"_blank\">193320</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9602\" target=\"_blank\">9602</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/5560\" target=\"_blank\">5560</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/83776\" target=\"_blank\">83776</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
