      "answer": "<p>If the purpose of this haircut is to resemble kaafir and atheist women, then it is haram, because imitation of non-Muslims is haram, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” If the aim is not to imitate the non-Muslims, and it is only a modern trend among women that is considered attractive, then a woman can adorn herself in this way for her husband and appear like this in front of her close friends so that she may look and feel good among them. We do not see anything wrong with this.</p>\n",

      "title": "Parents Differing on How to Raise Children",
      "question": "<p>If the parents disagree about the way to raise the children, and neither of them thinks the way the other does, does the wife have to obey her husband in that which she thinks will lead to fitnah for the son – as his father wants to call him to account for everything great or small – or can she pretend to be obeying him in front of him, then do what she thinks is appropriate with her son after that, in accordance with the words of Allah “Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)” [al-Tahreem 66:6] and the hadeeth “Each of you is a shepherd”? Or is this advice addressed only to the wali (guardian), who is the father? Or is this included in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator”? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Raising children is a responsibility that is shared by both parents. This is a trust which Allah enjoins them to take care of, each according to his position and ability, and this great responsibility cannot be restricted to one of them and not the other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Think about how the hadeeth refers to the responsibility of each parent, so as to reinforce the idea that each of them is individually responsible in this regard. And in the hadeeth about the fitrah pure state one is born in) we see how children take their religion from both parents, and not just one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (pure state of Islam), then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1292) and Muslim (2658).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to fulfilment of shared duties, Islam enjoins a means by which they are usually fulfilled in the best and most successful manner, which is by means of discussion and consultation. This may be the most important cause of family happiness and successful rearing of children. The command to consult one another regarding shared responsibilities is mentioned in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:233]</p>\n<p>Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., if the parents of the child agree to wean him before he is two years old, and they think that this is good for him, and they consult one another about that and agree on it, then there is no sin on them for that. It may be understood from this that if one of them makes this decision on his or her own that is not sufficient and it is not permissible for one of them to decide that without consulting the other. This was stated by al-Thawri and others. This is safer for the child and ensures that his interests will be looked after. This is by the mercy of Allah towards His slaves, as He has set out guidelines for the parents in raising their child, and has enjoined that which is in their best interests and the child’s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer al-Qur’aan il-‘Azeem (1/380).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some studies indicate that many marital problems that lead to divorce are caused by the absence of this matter in the marriage, namely consultation in family life, or by some error in implementing it. Discussion and consultation are an art and a science which must be practised and exercised and understood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is natural that the parents’ opinions with regard to some shared responsibilities, such as raising the children, will sometimes differ, and that is due to differences in the background of the parents, or because of interference by some relatives, or other reasons. But this should not lead to a crisis unless the parents fail to reach an appropriate way of dealing with this difference of opinion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a solution that may be suggested to resolve the difference in the parents’ methods of child-rearing, which is consulting a specialist or someone whom they may easily consult about the problems concerning which they differ, who has experience and can be trusted. Raising children is an art and a science in itself on which studies are done and for which certificates are awarded. Indeed it is one of the most important and precise of specialities. The parents will always be able find some trustworthy specialists in child-rearing, so they should consult them and ask their opinions concerning the specific point of conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps if the parents understand the serious repercussions that difference in opinion on child-rearing will have on the son’s personality, that will make them realize that it is essential to overcome this problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The message that the father wants to convey may be lost and its effects may be weakened if the mother gives a different message, and that may lead to the son choosing the message that suits him, and in many case he will come up with a third solution, based on his own whims and desires. This means that it will be difficult for the son to distinguish between right and wrong, halaal (lawful)and haraam haram (unlawful), , and this is the greatest threat to a sound upbringing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Differences with regard to child-rearing may lead to the child hating one of his parents and may lead to greater and greater problems at later stages, based on the depth of the differences between the father and the mother with regard to raising the children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So it is essential to have agreement between the father and mother from the outset that neither of them will send a different message to the children than the other, especially in front of them. If there is any comment or disagreement to be voiced, then it should be delayed until they can discuss it away from where the children can hear them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also very important for the parents to interact with one another honestly and sincerely. It is not appropriate, according to sharee’ah (Islamic law), common sense, education or manners, for one of the parents to pretend to the other that he or she agrees with a specific point of child-rearing, when in fact he or she thinks otherwise and does not do that. The other party will soon discover the deception and there will be a loss of trust between the parents with regard to raising the children, which will only lead to further problems, whereas being honest, consulting one another and coming to mutual agreements will lead to overcoming this difference of opinion and will help the parents to overcome other differences too, when they get used to consulting one another and working things out together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also essential to remember that Allah is always watching how we raise our children, and to refer to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions and teachings) of His Messenger with regard to principles of child-rearing in the event of any difference of opinion. If the difference has to do with methods, then the way to solve it is by consulting one another and discussing the matter, after which the one to decide between them is a sincere and trustworthy adviser who is a specialist or who has experience. If the parents are sincere in their intention to teach the child the proper attitude and religion, then Allah will grant them a way out from their differences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, it must be noted that Allah has created in women that which He has not created in man. Emotion and compassion are stronger in women than in men, and reason, willpower and management are stronger in men than in women. Attention should be paid to this fact when there are differences of opinion between the spouses, and perhaps if the matter is delegated to the husband that will be very beneficial, if the husband is religiously-committed and wise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She is a non-Muslim monotheist and is asking why it is not permissible for a Muslim man to marry her?",
      "question": "<p>Hello and thank you for receiving my question. As a female looking to marry a Muslim guy, I consider myself Natural and organic ideologically. At this point I've Recognized that there is one god, That controls everything And is The Guardian and creator of everything in existence. As far as other things , That religions preach, (Mostly the monotheistic religions) about prophets angels, etc, I'm not disagreeing or agreeing with it at the moment. But I do know that there is one God only.</p>\n<p> With that being said I know some things about Islam where The Muslim man can marry a Christian or Jew female, BECAUSE THEY ARE 'MONOTHEISTIC' Compared to the other religions.</p>\n<p> So my question is if I'm monotheistic just like the Christian and Jewish woman is, Then I should be able to marry this Muslim man. IF YOUR GOING TO SAY NO, because they're people of the book, what's the difference between me if i don't believe/ recognize the prophets yet, and a Christian women who believes in some prophets and not in others like prophet Muhammad. So why the double standards,(if you say no).</p>\n<p> Thank you again for taking time to read this question and please take into consideration that there isnt any other detailed (muslim/ non muslim marriage) question like this on your website so please take time and thought in answering it. Because as simple as your religion is I'm pretty much at the basic similar level with you, that would consider me to be monotheistic although not Muslim</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If you really believe in the one God and Creator, then what is your excuse for not believing in His Messengers?</p>\n<p>How can you be a believer in God when you do not worship Him according to any religion?</p>\n<p>Do you think that believing is a merely theoretical matter that does not require any deeds or obligations?</p>\n<p>Belief in God has two aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>believing in His Oneness and perfection;</li>\n<li>and worshipping Him, seeking to draw near to Him, obeying Him and complying with His commands. That includes believing in His Books and His Messengers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So long as God has blessed you with insight and understanding, what is keeping you from becoming Muslim?</p>\n<p>Entering Islam and hastening to do so, without wasting a single moment, is more appropriate and more important than simply thinking about the issue of marriage or asking about it.</p>\n<p>Not one of us can guarantee that he will live a moment longer, but if he enters the true religion, he will attain the means of eternal happiness and will save himself from the fire.</p>\n<p>We invite you to do that and advise you to do it, so hasten and do not delay.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Islam is based on being a true slave or servant of God, for the servant can only hear and obey the command of his lord and master.</p>\n<p>Whoever believes in God accepts His rulings, submits and surrenders to them, and strives to put them into practice as much as he can.</p>\n<p>One of these rulings is the prohibition on marrying a woman who is not a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian).</p>\n<p>This ruling is definitive in the religion of Islam, and there is no room for debate concerning it.</p>\n<p>God, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him”</p>\n<p>[al-Qasas 28:68]</p>\n<p>“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:36].</p>\n<p>If a monotheistic Muslim woman believes in God and all His Prophets and Messengers, but she disbelieves in one verse of the Book of God [the Qur’an], may He be exalted, or rejects something that is well known to be part of the religion, then she goes beyond the pale of Islam by doing that, and it is forbidden for a Muslim man to marry her.</p>\n<p>It is not only the matter of whether a woman is a monotheist or not. If that were the case, it would not be permissible to marry a Christian woman, because in fact she is a polytheist, not a monotheist.</p>\n<p>Rather it is the matter of what God has permitted and what He has forbidden, for He is the one who has the power to command and forbid. He has permitted marriage to a Muslim woman and a kitaabi [i.e., Jewish or Christian] woman, and He has not permitted marriage to any other women, so the individual has no option but to accept that and submit to it.</p>\n<p>If a person does not understand this principle on which Islam – and all other religions – is based, namely compliance and obedience, then his monotheism or affirmation of God’s oneness will never be sound, and no good deed will ever be accepted from him, no matter how much he claims to be a believer or a monotheist.</p>\n<p>God, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisaa’ 4:65].</p>\n<p>This does not mean that we cannot understand the wisdom behind many teachings; rather we understand a great deal of that, but we believe and we submit, even if it so happens that we do not understand the wisdom behind a particular teaching.</p>\n<p>It may be noted here that God, the All-Knowing and All-Aware, knows that the kitaabi [i.e., Jewish or Christian] woman who believes in God, and believes in His messages in general terms, and believes in the resurrection is, as a result of that, close to Islam, and marrying her will, in most cases, call her and her family to Islam, and encourage her to enter Islam, in contrast to a woman who does not believe in God, or in the Prophets, or in the resurrection.</p>\n<p>This may be the wisdom behind it, or it may be that we have not got it right in what we have said about the reason behind this teaching.</p>\n<p>But whatever the case, we believe that Allah does not prescribe anything except for a wise purpose, and we do not make following any of His rulings dependent upon knowing the wisdom behind it; rather we comply and submit, and we trust that He, may He be glorified, is the All-Knowing, the Most Wise, the All-Aware.</p>\n<p>So you should examine the matter in this light, on the basis of the following straightforward approach:</p>\n<p>If there is one God and Creator, then it is He Who has the power to command and prohibit, and He is most merciful and most kind; He sent the Messengers and revealed the Books to guide thereby whoever wants to be His slave and servant.</p>\n<p>The one who attains the honour of this servitude to God has no right to object to His rulings.</p>\n<p>So you must rectify your belief in God’s oneness and your faith in Him, by believing in His prophets and messengers and entering this great religion which God approves for His slaves and servants, so that you may attain happiness and save yourself from the Fire.</p>\n<p>We hope that your common senses and insight will lead you to that very soon, if God wills.</p>\n<p>We ask God to open and illuminate your heart, and guide you to that which will lead to your success.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She wants to marry a student like her and her family doesn’t agree",
      "question": "<p>A men, who I think is a very good muslim and Allah knows the best, has asked for my hand in marriage. I love him very much but my parents disapprove of this marriage for the following reasons. They think I am too young. They think that he (we) will not be able to support ourselves since both of us are students. They want me to finish school (i am in my last year of high school) and maybe even finish university before getting married for they think that is i get married i will not complete my studies. Please advise me on what i should do and what right i have in this.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah mercy on him) was asked a     similar question and said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ruling on that is that it is contrary to the command of the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose     religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him.” Undoubtedly your     father’s preventing you from marrying one who is suitable is something that is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and it does not mean     that you cannot study, because the two can be combined. What I advise my brothers who are the guardians of women to do, is to let them complete     their studies; a woman may stipulate as a condition of her marriage that she be able to continue studying until her studies are complete.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/704-705.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what you mention about the situation of the one who has proposed     marriage and that he is still a student, being a student is not regarded as an impediment to marriage if he can afford to get married and to spend     on his wife on a reasonable basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if his being a student means that he cannot afford to get married and spend on     his wife – apart from the unreasonable demands that some families make in the conditions that they stipulate – this is addressed by the words of     Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves     chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty”</p>\n<p>[al-Noor 24:33]</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this verse, Allaah commands everyone who is     unable to get married and cannot find any means of doing so to keep himself chaste, because the most common obstacle to marriage is lack of money.     So Allaah promises independence of means by His bounty, so that He will provide what one needs to get married or to find a woman who will accept a     small mahr, or else remove from him the desire to marry.” Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/242&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the mahr and maintenance are the rights of the woman, not     of her guardians. She has the right to agree to a little and to marry one whom she knows is poor, but it has to be pointed out that many woman may     agree to marry a man even though he is poor when he proposes to her, then shortly after marriage the woman may start to complain, and that leads     to arguments and divorce. This should be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise families and guardians not to be an obstacle to keeping their daughters     and female relatives chaste because of the unreasonable conditions that they stipulate regarding spending on the basis that they want to be     reassured about their daughters’ future. This puts off the men who want to marry them, which leads to them being left on the shelf and the evils     that result from that, especially nowadays when fitnah (temptation) is so widespread. Thus they harm themselves and their daughters when their     intention is to do good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My question is: I was employed in an association in 2000, in a position that does not suit my university degree. I applied many times for promotion competitions in order to run away from the pressure I was suffering from my manager. All my attempts to get promotion were in vain until 2002, I was offered by a friend to pay an amount of money in return for having a better job. There were 50 jobs available.

      "answer": "<p>There is no doubt that paying a bribe in order to get a job is haraam both for the one who pays the bribe and the one who accepts it, and for the one who mediates between them.

      "question": "<p>I give birth in the month of Sha‘baan, then I got sick, and the blood of nifaas only lasted for three days, then it stopped, so I did ghusl and prayed. No blood came out at all until the month of Sha‘baan ended and Ramadan began, and after one week of Ramadan had passed, the doctor prescribed an antibiotic for me, so I was fasting but there was no bleeding during the day; only a few drops appeared before Maghrib. This continued for the rest of the month of Ramadan, and I could not tell whether I had become pure or not, but I fasted the entire month. Should I repeat the fast or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is no minimum duration for nifaas. If a woman’s nifaas (post-partum bleeding) ends after giving birth, even after only a few days, then she should do ghusl and pray and fast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3sisdVY\" target=\"_blank\">Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</a> (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>When a woman becomes pure [i.e., the bleeding ends], even if it is only one day or a few days after giving birth, then she is taahir (pure) and she must pray; her fasting is valid and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen.</p>\n<p>It may be determined whether a woman has become pure – following menses or nifaas (postpartum bleeding) – by one of two signs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Emission of the white discharge.</li>\n<li>Complete dryness, so that there is no trace of blood or yellowish or brownish discharge.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/156224\">156224</a>.</p>\n<p>These few drops of blood that appeared after becoming totally pure from nifaas are not regarded as being part of nifaas. Based on that, the woman should pray and fast in that case.</p>\n<p>In Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 2, 4/259), it says:</p>\n<p>His wife gave birth on the ninth day of Ramadan, and nine days after giving birth the bleeding stopped, so she did ghusl and started to pray and fast, but she noticed when night came that there were a few drops of blood, but she did not see anything like that during the day. What is the ruling on that, and are her prayer and fasting valid?</p>\n<p>Answer: If this woman saw a complete cessation of bleeding or the white discharge, then her prayer and fasting are valid, because she comes under the same ruling as women who are taahir (pure, i.e., not menstruating or bleeding postpartum). What she sees of a few drops of blood at night is not regarded as nifaas and is not described as blood, so it does not come under the ruling on nifaas. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>There is a woman who, after two months of nifaas and after becoming pure, began to find some small drops of blood. Should she stop fasting and stop praying? Or what should she do?</p>\n<p>Answer: If this woman became pure and definitely saw the tuhr indicating that menses or nifaas had ended – by which I mean the emission of the white discharge, which is well known to women – then anything that appears after the tuhr of brownish or yellowish discharge, or spots of blood, or wetness, none of this is menses, so it does not prevent her from praying and it does not prevent her from fasting, and it does not prevent a man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menses. Umm ‘Atiyyah said: We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as not being of any significance. Narrated by al-Bukhaari. Abu Daawood added: …after the tuhr. Its isnad is saheeh.</p>\n<p>Based on that, we say: Anything of that nature that happens after the tuhr has definitely occurred does not matter, and does not prevent the woman from praying or fasting or being intimate with her husband. But she should not rush until she sees the tuhr, because some women, when the bleeding stops, rush to do ghusl before seeing the tuhr. Hence the women of the Sahaabah would send their pieces of cloth – meaning the cotton on which there was blood – to Umm al-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and she would say to them: Do not be hasty, until you see the white discharge.

      "question": "<p>We are businessmen in an Arab country, and we deal with some European countries. In order to buy goods from these countries, we have to buy euros, but the state in which we live does not allow us to leave the country with euros, except for a very small amount that is not enough to pay for our purchase of goods there. This forces us to buy currency there in Europe, meaning that we pay dinars in our country before we leave, then later on we collect the foreign currency over there, in the country to which we travel when we want to buy goods. Other people pay bribes at the checkpoints in the airport in our country so that they will let them take the foreign currency abroad, but sometimes they are arrested, the money they have with them is confiscated and they are forced to pay a huge financial penalty. Is buying foreign currency in this way in order to avoid paying bribes and levies (mukoos) regarded as permissible or not? We do not have any other solution.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Trading in different currencies is called exchange, and in order for it to be permissible it is stipulated that the exchange takes place on the spot, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.” Narrated by Muslim (1587).</p>\n<p>Cash currencies take the place of gold and silver, so when buying one currency with another, that must be done “hand to hand.” This is what the fuqaha’ describe as “exchanging commodities in the same meeting as that in which the deal is done (meaning: on the spot).” In other words, it is not permissible for the seller and purchaser to part before each one receives the amount of currency that has become his through this deal.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Buying and selling currencies is permissible, but it is stipulated that the exchange be done hand-to-hand if the currencies differ. So if someone sells Libyan currency for American or Egyptian or any other currency hand to hand, there is nothing wrong with that, such as if he buys dollars with Libyan currency hand to hand, so he takes [the dollars] from him and hands over [the Libyan currency] on the spot, or he buys Egyptian or British or any other currency with Libyan currency or any other, hand to hand, there is nothing wrong with that. But if the exchange is to be done at a later date, that is not permissible. The same applies if the exchange does not take place in the same meeting – it is not permissible, because what you describe in the question is regarded as a type of riba-based transaction. So it is essential that the exchange be done on the spot, hand to hand, if the currencies are different. But if they are of the same type, then there are two conditions which must be met: the amounts should be equal and the exchange should take place on the spot, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver…”</p>\n<p>The ruling on currencies is the same as the ruling on gold and silver: if they differ, then it is permissible for their amounts to differ, but the exchange must take place on the spot. If they are of the same type, such as dollars for dollars or dinars for dinars, then the exchange must take place on the spot and be of equal amounts. And Allah is the source of strength.\"(<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp; 19/171-174).</p>\n<p>Receipt of payment may take several forms, including: cheques, bank transfers and depositing in the [seller’s] account.</p>\n<p>A statement was issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League during its eleventh session, in which it says:</p>\n<p>After studying and researching, the Council reached consensus on the following:</p>\n<p>1.. Receipt of the cheque takes the place of receipt of the money when the necessary conditions are met regarding exchange of currencies through bank transfers.</p>\n<p>2.. The recording of that in the bank’s records comes under the same ruling as receiving the money for one who wants to exchange one currency for another, whether that is on the basis of cash that the person brings to the bank or money that is already in his account. End quote.</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta were asked:</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on money that is exchanged from one currency to another? For example, I receive my salary in Saudi riyals and I exchange it for Sudanese pounds; please note that one Saudi riyal equals three Sudanese pounds. Is this riba?</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country, even if the two amounts differ, because of the difference in type, as in the example mentioned in the question. But that is subject to the condition that the exchange take place on the spot. Receiving a cheque or a bank transfer note comes under the same ruling as receiving the money on the spot.\"(<em>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah</em>&nbsp; 13/448).</p>\n<p>If you pay the dinars in a bank in your country, and they give you a cheque or a transfer for the equivalent amount in euros, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you give the dinars in your country to someone who will put them in your account overseas at the same time, in the equivalent amount in euros, this is also permissible.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to charge levies on goods, cash or anything else. The individual has the right to try to avoid that by giving some of his money and he should not fall into riba in order to avoid that.</p>\n<p>We have previously discussed the issue of paying bribes in order to avoid injustice or to obtain one’s rights, in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/72268\" target=\"_blank\">72268</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Does Feeling That Something Came Out of the Back Passage Break Wudu?",
      "question": "<p>After I defecate, I feel something coming out of the back passage. Sometimes there is something and sometimes I do not find anything. </p>\n<p>My question is: do I have to check my Wudu for every prayer? What about the prayers I did in the past? Do I have to repeat them? Please note that I do not know how many they are.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">If a person relieves himself, cleans himself, and then does Wudu, he is in a state of ritual purity until he is certain that there is something that has invalidated his Wudu. His Wudu does not become invalidated because of mere doubts, even if the doubt is so strong that he thinks it most likely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Based on this, merely feeling that something has come out of the back passage is not counted as invalidating Wudu. You should also beware of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/148426\" target=\"_blank\">whispers from Satan</a> . So long as you have done <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2137\" target=\"_blank\">Instinja</a> (washing the private parts with water) and cleaned the place properly, you do not have to check before praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The prayers that you have offered do not have to be repeated, because you were in a state of purity and you were not certain that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/212088\" target=\"_blank\">there was anything that would invalidate it</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This principle is indicated by the report narrated by Al-Bukhaari (137) and Muslim (361) from `Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that a man complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he imagined that he felt something when he was praying, and he said: “You should not stop (the prayer), unless you hear a sound or smell something (and odour).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">“This Hadith is one of the basic principles of Islam, and an important principle of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), which is that things remain as they are unless there is certainty that they have changed, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/145752\" target=\"_blank\">doubting what is certain does not affect it</a> . &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Another issue related to this Hadith is that if a person is certain that he purified himself and is uncertain that he has invalidated it, then the ruling is that he is still in a state of purity, and it makes no difference whether this doubt occurs during the prayer or outside the prayer. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars of the earlier and later generations. … Our companions said: With regard to doubt it makes no difference whether the two possibilities with regard to invalidation of purity are equal or not, or if one of them is more likely, or he thinks it most likely. He does not have to do Wudu in any case.” (Sharh Muslim)&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When I urinate and do Wudu then pray, I feel that something is coming out of my penis, and when I check it I find that some urine has come out. What is the solution?&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">“Undoubtedly in His wisdom, Allah has made strong nerves that control urine and faeces so that nothing comes out. But these nerves may be affected by sickness so that they become weak, then urine comes out either continuously or occasionally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A person may himself be the cause of that, because there are some people who, when they finish urinating, squeeze the urethra to the end of the penis, so as to extract the urine, and there are some who keep squeezing until the last drop of urine comes out. This is a mistake, even though some jurists say that it is Sunnah to extract the last drop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This is a weak view, and in fact is innovation, as was stated by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and as is obvious from the Sunnah, because there is no report that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) squeezed the urethra to the end of the penis, or that he squeezed it to extract the urine. But some people do that, either because they are following the opinion of the jurists who said that, or because they imagine that if they do not do that, there will be some urine left in the penis. But this is a mistake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">If a person urinates and washes the tip of the penis only, that is sufficient and there is no need to squeeze it or shake it. Rather he should wash the tip of the penis where the urine has got onto it, and that is the end of the matter, even if the person has gotten used to doing this because of this sickness of which he himself is the cause.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">My advice to him is: if this happens to you, do not pay any attention to it, do not squeeze the penis, rather leave it as it is. When the last drop of urine has come out, you should wash the tip of the penis, and you may feel something in his penis but you do not have to look, because some people, when they feel something in the penis, they pull down their trousers and start squeezing the penis from the end. But if one squeezes it something will inevitably come out. Rather you should leave it and not pay any attention to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Some of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: ‘In this case <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/100268\" target=\"_blank\">if he is affected by these whispers</a> , he should sprinkle some water on his trousers so that if he thinks or doubts, then he can assume it is this water.’&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But we say: there is no need for that, and this is too much. Do not do that, and do not pay any attention to it, and it will go away in sha Allah. If you feel some coolness at the tip of the penis or you feel something in the penis, do not go and look, and just ignore it.\" (Al-Liqa’ Al-Shahri)&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
