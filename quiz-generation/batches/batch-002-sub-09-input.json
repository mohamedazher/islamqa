      "title": "Warding Off Thoughts of Zina",
      "question": "<p>What should you do if you find yourself thinking about zina (fornication/adultery)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Thinking about zinaa may mean one of two things.</p>\n<p>(1)It may be merely thoughts that cross the mind, without becoming a firm resolve. A person cannot be blamed for this, but it is better to rid oneself of these thoughts so that they do not lead to anything else.</p>\n<p>(2)It may be an established thought accompanied by resolve and intention. In this case, the person must hasten to deal with it in a number of ways, including the following:</p>\n<p>1-Seriously thinking of getting married, because this is the shar’i (legal Islamic) and natural protection for the Muslim man and woman.</p>\n<p>2-Fasting if one cannot get married.</p>\n<p>3-Muslim men and women should strive to strengthen their eemaan (faith) by reading Qur’aan, praying naafil (voluntary) prayers and doing other kinds of acts of worship.</p>\n<p>4-Taking care to choose righteous friends.</p>\n<p>5-Keeping away from everything that might provoke desire; one of the most obvious of these is looking at things which are haram (impermissible).</p>\n<p>6-Remembering the punishment for zinaa in this world and in the Hereafter, and that its evil affects far outweigh the immediate pleasure that a person may experience.</p>\n",

      "title": "She wore niqaab during Hajj; is there any sin on her?",
      "question": "<p>A couple of years back i went for the holy pilgrimage of hajj . at the time i performed the hajj wearing a nikab , it has come to my attention that its not permissable for women to cover their faces during the pilgrimage . when i did wear the nikab , i was informed by good sources that it was permissable .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>1 – Covering the face is something good for women. May Allah bestow abundant mercy on the women who cover their faces with niqaab. Perhaps your question is based on keenness for your religion – may Allah increase your keenness – but it is better to heed the commands of the religion, which tells women to remove the niqaab from their faces during prayer and Hajj, but especially during prayer, when it is not permissible to cover the face at all except if there are non-mahram men present. During Hajj it is permissible for women to lower the veil over their faces provided that it does not cling to their faces; this is what is called the burqa’. It is not permissible for the woman in ihram to wear it, but it is permissible for her to lower over her face a cover which comes down from her head over her face. If the burqa’ is not available, and there are men present who should not see the woman’s face, then it is permissible for her to wear the niqaab.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what kind of clothes do you command us to wear during ihram?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not wear a shirt or pants or a turban or a burnous. If one of you does not have any sandals then let him wear the khuffayn (leather slippers) and cut them so that they come below the ankle. Do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or turmeric. Women in ihram should not wear niqaab or gloves.”</p>\n<p>(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1468; Muslim, 1177).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – With regard to lowering a cover over the face other than the niqaab, or for fear of being seen by non-mahram men, it has been reported in saheeh reports that some of the Sahaabiyyaat (women of the Sahaabah) did that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “We used to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when we were in ihram. If we met the riders we would lower our garments over our faces.</p>\n<p>(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman in ihram to cover her face; rather he forbade the niqaab only because it is worn on the face. He differentiated between the niqaab and covering the face. Based on this, if a woman in ihram covers her face, we say there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better for her to uncover it so long as there are no non-mahram men around her, in which case she should cover her face from them. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/153&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – With regard to the past and the Hajj that you did in the manner you describe, there is no sin on you because you were unaware. If a person does something that is not allowed during ihram because he was unaware or he forgot, there is no sin on him, and he does not have to offer any fidyah (ransom).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ya’la ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in al-Ji’raanah and entered ihram for ‘Umrah. The man had dyed his beard and hair with saffron, and he was wearing a jubbah (cloak). He said, “Take off your jubbah and wash off your saffron, and whatever you do in your Hajj, do in your ‘Umrah.”</p>\n<p>(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1697; Muslim, 1180).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similar to forgetting are cases where one is unaware or is forced to do something, i.e., if a person forgets and puts on ordinary clothes when he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he has to take them off and put on the izaar and rida’ (ihram garments). The same applies to perfume; if he puts on perfume, forgetting that he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he must hasten to wash it off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/222</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Ghusul</div>\n<div>I had intercourse with my husband and had my hair done just before that (I have Hijab). Do I have to rinse my hair entirely or can I just wipe it with water from the outside. May God reward you with goodness.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>When performing ghusl because of janaabah (impurity, e.g. after intercourse), both men and women must wash their heads and ensure that the water reaches the roots of the hair; it is not sufficient merely to wipe the head. A woman who wears her hair in braids is excused from having to undo her braids when doing ghusl because of janaabah, due to the difficulty involved in doing them up again. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who wears her hair in braids. Do I have to undo my braids when I make ghusl because of janaabah?’ He said, ‘No, it is enough if you pour water on your head three times, and then over the rest of your body. That will make you clean.’”</p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim, no. 497).</p>\n<p>But in the case of a woman who has ended her period or nifaas (post-natal bleeding), she has to undo her braids when she does ghusl.

      "title": "He was not sure about the number of prostrations, and he omitted the prostration of forgetfulness out of ignorance; what is the ruling on his prayer?",
      "question": "<p>He was not sure about the number of prostrations, so he proceeded on the basis of what was certain, and did another prostration, based on the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz, then he did not do the prostration of forgetfulness after the prayer, thinking that he did not have to do it. Is his prayer valid?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If a person is unsure about the number of prostrations, in the sense that he is not sure whether he prostrated once or twice, then he should proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is the smaller number. So he should assume that he has done one prostration, and do a second prostration; then he should do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam, by way of preference. This view is the one favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to uncertainty in the prayer, he should do another prostration and proceed on the basis of what is certain. If he is not sure whether he prostrated once or twice, he should do another prostration, whether that is in the first rak‘ah or in the second, third or fourth, and he should do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam, but if he does it after the salaam it does not matter, although it is preferable to do it before the salaam.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz (30/11)</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that uncertainty about not having done essential parts of the prayer is like uncertainty concerning the number of rak‘ahs, so one should proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is the smaller number, if one of the two possibilities is not more likely in his view, and in this case he should do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam.</p>\n<p>But if one of the two possibilities is more likely in his view, then he should proceed on that basis, and in that case the prostration of forgetfulness should come after the salaam.</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“If he is not certain about having omitted an essential part of the prayer, then it is as if he did omit it” – this is our view and it is the view of most of our companions, and was stated definitively by some of them. And it was said that he should try to work it out and proceed on the basis of what he thinks most likely to be the case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Insaaf (2/150)</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“If he is not certain about having omitted an essential part of the prayer, then it is as if he did omit it” – that is, if he is not sure whether he did that essential part or omitted it, then the ruling in this case is the same as the ruling on one who did omit it.</p>\n<p>For example, if he got up to do the second rak‘ah, then was not sure whether he had prostrated twice or only once,</p>\n<p>Uncertainty about whether one omitted an essential part of the prayer is like omitting it, because the basic principle is that it was not done. So if he was uncertain as to whether he had done it, but he thinks it most likely that he did do it, then according to the more correct view, which is that one should act upon what one thinks most likely to be the case, then he is deemed to have done it and he does not have to do go back and repeat it, because we stated that if he is uncertain about the number of rak‘ahs, he should proceed on the basis of what he thinks was likely to be the case, but he has to do the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (3/384)</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that whoever omits to do the prostration of forgetfulness because he forgot to do it should make it up so long as it is not been a long time since he finished the prayer. However, if a long time has passed since he finished the prayer, then the prostration of forgetfulness is waived in his case, and his prayer is valid.</p>\n<p>Al-Bahooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If he forgets the prostration (of forgetfulness), and it was preferable to do it before saying the salaam, then he should make it up. If he has started another prayer, then he should make it up when he has said the salaam at the end of that prayer, if only a short time has elapsed and he has not invalidated his wudoo’ or left the mosque. But if a long time has elapsed, according to custom, or he invalidated his wudoo’ or left the mosque, then he should not make up the prostration of forgetfulness, because the time for it has passed, but his prayer is still valid – as in the case of all other obligatory (waajib) duties if a person forgets to do them by mistake.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat (1/235)</p>\n<p>With regard to this matter, the one who is ignorant is like the one who forgot.</p>\n<p>It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol 2 – 6/10):</p>\n<p>If he omitted the prostration of forgetfulness deliberately, his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat it. If he omitted it because he forgot or was ignorant of the ruling, then he does not have to repeat it and his prayer is valid. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>If a person does too many rak‘ahs in the prayer, or omits anything from it, and does not do the prostration of forgetfulness, is the prayer rendered invalid?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>That depends. If he decided to omit this prostration whilst he was praying, if he did that deliberately and was aware of the shar‘i ruling, then his prayer is rendered invalid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he was ignorant of the ruling or forgot, then it is not rendered invalid, and his prayer is still valid.</p>\n<p>End quote from <a href=\"http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/15296\" target=\"_blank\">Fatawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb</a> by Ibn Baz</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer&nbsp;to question&nbsp;no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/95410\" target=\"_blank\">95410</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The prohibition on masturbation is not from a medical point of view only",
      "question": "<p>I have an important question about masturbation. I have read the previous fatwa on it but am curious as to whether it may be changed due to new knowledge. One of the things I read about, why masturbation is haram is because of the ‘negative effects’ of it. However research done by professors has proven that all the old myths about it are false. Scientific research has actually proven the opposite that masturbation has many health benefits. I will name a few, it promotes the release of endorphins, the neurotransmitters associated with happy feelings that can improve the overall mood and fight off depression. It produces a chemical called oxytocin which works as a natural pain and improves pain resistance and tolerance. Masturbation also releases cortisol which improves the immune system. Masturbation has also been proven to help in the prevention of type-2 diabetes and prostate cancer by releasing cancer causing agents. Due to the fact that masturbation is not directly declared haram by Quran or hadith doesn’t the decision rest with whether it benefits of harms a person? With the present facts in mind it is obvious and scientifically proven that there are many effective health benefits of masturbation. And also the old myths and misconceptions about any harm it was thought to cause have been proven false. With the apparent facts wouldn’t the ruling on masturbation be changed as the benefit clearly outweighs any harm it was believed to have caused?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the shar‘i ruling was worked out on the basis of medical information only, and the medical findings changed, then in that case the shar‘i ruling would also change according to new medical findings. That is like the change in the ruling on smoking – over the years – for example. Because medical knowledge when tobacco first appeared and was used for smoking did not indicate that there was any real physical harm from tobacco, the fatwas of many scholars at that time said that it was permissible to deal with tobacco, consume it and buy and sell it. But when medical science advanced and new medical research proved the grievous harm that smoking causes to the human body, the shar‘i ruling changed and it was prohibited. The fatwas of most contemporary scholars state that it is prohibited, because the ruling on smoking is based on medical findings and the harms and benefits that tobacco may cause. It is not something based on specific religious texts.</p>\n<p>The agreed-upon fiqhi principle states that the ruling is connected to the reason for it, and the ruling applies when the reason for it is present, and does not apply when the reason is absent. See Tahqeeq al-Burhaan fi Sha’n ad-Dukhaan by Mar‘i al-Karami (d. 1033 AH), annotated by Mashhoor Hasan Salmaan.</p>\n<p>This in fact is not a change to the shar‘i ruling; rather it is a change in the view of the scholars that is based on the findings on smoking and the harm it causes.</p>\n<p>As for masturbation, or the “secret habit”, the reason for its prohibition as mentioned by the scholars is not physical harm only. Rather it is aimed at preventing physical desires from dominating a person’s thinking, and not allowing any way of fulfilling those desires except through halaal marriage. We may note this idea in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts).</p>\n<p>Except from their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame;</p>\n<p>But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors”&nbsp;[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-7].</p>\n<p>The shar‘i reason for not allowing it is based on the apparent meaning of this verse, which the scholars may understand in various ways and reach a number of conclusions:</p>\n<p>It is aimed at barring the means of fulfilling these overwhelming desires that may go beyond the secret habit to looking for haram means such as watching movies, engaging in unlawful relationships and looking at images.</p>\n<p>It is aimed at protecting man’s power of reasoning and physical energy from being wasted in an inappropriate manner. Or it may be prohibited on the grounds that it is contrary to dignity, and so as to protect the individual from doing base and ignoble actions which serve no purpose, therefore it could be prohibited on moral grounds, as Imam Ahmad ibn Hazm said: We disapprove of it, because it is contrary to noble characteristics and virtuous deeds. End quote from al-Muhalla (12/407).</p>\n<p>Medicine is also one of the reasons that could be understood from the verse. That is because doctors have affirmed the harm of this practice and its addictive nature that could lead to ruining one’s health. So medicine is not the only reason for this shar‘i ruling, such that it might be said that the ruling should change with changes in medical findings.</p>\n<p>We searched the books of the fuqaha’ and we did not find anyone who limited the reasons for the prohibition on masturbation to medical findings on its harm. Rather we found in the words of ash-Shawkaani that which indicates that medical knowledge is just one of the reasons for the prohibition; it is not the only reason. That is when he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Among the reasons they cited is the fact that masturbation is harmful, as was mentioned by physicians. End quote from al-Fath ar-Rabbaani (7/3380).</p>\n<p>We say all of this on the assumption that what is mentioned of health benefits of the secret habit is actually correct. But proving that requires proper scientific studies or the support of specialists whose views are based on definitive academic research, not just quoting some statements (of unknown people) from here and there, because such quotations do not constitute knowledge or a sound view.</p>\n<p>We refer you to what has been written on some medical websites that are supervised by specialists, for you will find some beneficial information there, in sha Allah:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.altibbi.com/definition/masturbation\">http://www.altibbi.com/definition/masturbation</a></p>\n<p>For more information on the ruling on masturbation from our website, please see the following numbers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/329\" target=\"_blank\">329</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20161\" target=\"_blank\">20161</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/101539\" target=\"_blank\">101539</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "At what point should one stand up when hearing the Iqamah?",
      "question": "<p>When to stand in Iqamah?</p>\n<div>Is it immediately after \"Allahu Akbar\"(of Iqamah),in between of Iqamah or after \"la illaha illah\"(of Iqamah).</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the point at which one should stand up to pray. There are several opinions that were mentioned by an-Nawawi in al-Majmoo‘ (3/233), and they are as follows:</p>\n<p>(i)That he should stand up when the muezzin starts to recite the Iqamah. This is the view of ‘Ata’ and az-Zuhri</p>\n<p>(ii)That he should stand up when the muezzin says “hayya ‘ala as-salah (come to prayer)”. This is the view of Abu Haneefah.</p>\n<p>(iii)That he should stand up when the muezzin has completed the Iqamah. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i.</p>\n<p>(iv)That there is no specific point at which one should stand up; rather it is permissible for the worshipper to stand up at the beginning of the Iqamah, during it or at the end of it. This is the view of the Maalikis.</p>\n<p>(v)That it is Sunnah to stand up when the muezzin says “Qad qaamat is-salah (prayer is about to begin)” if the worshipper can see the imam; if he cannot see him, then he should stand up when he does see the imam. This is the view of Imam Ahmad.</p>\n<p>There is no clear evidence from the Sunnah to support any of these opinions; rather this is the ijtihaad worked out by the imams according to what each of them thought was correct.</p>\n<p>Based on that, the matter is broad in scope, so the worshipper may stand up whenever he wants, at the beginning of the Iqamah or during it. But the Sunnah indicates that if the muezzin gives the Iqamah for prayer when the imam has not yet entered the mosque, then the worshippers may not stand up until they see him.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Abu Qataadah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Iqamah for prayer is given, do not stand up until you see me.”. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (637) and Muslim (604). According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Until you see that I have come out.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Rushd al-Maaliki said: … If this is sound – i.e., the hadith of Abu Qataadah quoted above, then it must be followed, otherwise the issue remains as is, and may be overlooked, meaning that there is no prescription concerning it, but whenever a person stands up, it is fine.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/112).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there any mention in the Sunnah of a specific time to stand up for prayer when the Iqamah is recited?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>The Sunnah does not say anything specific about standing up, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not stand up until you see me.” So whether a person stands up at the beginning of the Iqamah, or whilst it is being recited, or when it ends, all of that is permissible. End quote.</p>\n<p>Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (13/8).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not prescribed to give the Iqamah for any but the five daily prayers.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not prescribed to give the Adhan or Iqamah for any but the five [daily prayers], whether they are in fulfiment of a vow or the funeral prayer or a Sunnah prayer, and whether it is prescribed to offer them in congregation, such as the Eid prayers, eclipse prayers and prayer for rain (istisqaa’) or not, such as Duhaa prayer. … This is the view of the majority of scholars of the earlier and later generations.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (3/83).</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9360</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should the equipment in a store be included when calculating zakah?",
      "question": "<p>I want to ask about zakah, I have a store selling stationery and offering services for students. I have read about zakah on trade goods when one year has passed, but there is a question about student services – should photocopying equipment be included when calculating zakah, as it is very costly?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have to pay zakah on all the wealth that you have in the form of cash or products offered for sale in the stationery store after one full (Hijri) year has passed, if their value meets the minimum threshold for zakah (nisab).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/313.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The nisab is twenty mithqaal of gold, i.e., eighty-five grams; or one hundred and forty mithqaal of silver (i.e., 595 grams). The equivalent in Saudi dirhams of silver is fifty-six riyals.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa al-‘Uthaymeen, 18/93.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the value of the goods offered for sale, plus the cash money that you have is equal to one of these two nisabs, gold or silver, then you have to pay zakah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/257.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How zakah is to be calculated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If one year has passed for the threshold, you should calculate how much money you have, and add to that the value of the goods offered for sale in the stationery store, then pay one-quarter of one-tenth (i.e., 2.5%) of the total, which you should give to those who are entitled to it of the groups mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“As-Sadaqaat (here it means zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise”&nbsp;[Al-Tawbah 9:60]</p>\n<p>The value of the goods on sale in the stationery store should be based on the price for which they are sold, not the price for which they were bought. See question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/26236\" target=\"_blank\">26236</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the photographic equipment, there is no zakah on it, unless you have prepared it for sale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no zakah on items that are for use, whether they are tools or other things. The basic principle is that whatever is prepared for sale is that on which zakah is due. Tools or equipment used in the store are not subject to zakah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa Ibn Baz, 14/184.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should he wake his family for Fajr prayer even though they are exhausted and tired?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for me to wake my wife for Fajr prayer knowing that she breastfeeds her small daughter during the night and sometimes she is very exhausted?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Prayer is very important,     and we are commanded to offer prayers at the prescribed times; we are urged     to do that and we are warned against neglecting it. This is well known. For     example, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, As‑Salaah (the     prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’ 4:103]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Guard strictly (five     obligatory) As‑Salawaat (the prayers) especially the middle Salaah (i.e. the     best prayer ‑ ‘Asr). And stand before Allaah with obedience”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:238]</p>\n<p>And the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when he was asked which deed is     most beloved to Allaah: “Prayer offered on time.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari     (527) and Muslim (85).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you should beware of     missing prayer or delaying it until the time for it is over, because Allaah     says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Then, there has     succeeded them a posterity who have given up As‑Salaah (the prayers) [i.e.     made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by     not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed     times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”</p>\n<p>[Maryam 19:59]</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to     delay prayers beyond their appointed time unless that is for a reason that     makes it permissible to join prayers at the time of the earlier or later     prayer. It is well known that Fajr prayer cannot be joined with any prayer     before or after it, so it must be offered on time, no matter how sick or     tired a person is, so long as he is conscious and of sound mind. He should     pray standing, but if he cannot then he may offer it sitting, and if he     cannot do that then he may pray lying down. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sleeper should take     precautions to help him wake up, such as not staying up late, setting an     alarm clock and asking others to help him wake up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The husband is enjoined to     take care of his family and save them from the Fire, as Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Ward     off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and     stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey     not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that     which they are commanded”</p>\n<p>[al-Tahreem 66:6]</p>\n<p>Based on this, you should     be keen to wake up your wife and encourage her and help her to pray; you can     delay waking her up until it is nearly the end of the time for prayer. We     ask Allaah to guide and help us and you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",
