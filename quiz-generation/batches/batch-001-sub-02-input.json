      "title": "Should he pay zakah on shares that were given to him by the company and over which he has no control?",
      "question": "<p>I live in UK. My husband works for a company, which provides raw materials to other companies for making soaps, shampoos, cosmetics etc. For 3 years, he buys some company shares every month. The number of shares is doubled by the company for its employees.<br />\nFew days ago, when I was browsing your website, I came to know that we’ve to pay zakah on shares. We didn’t know that before.<br />\nNow I’ve some questions:<br />\n1. My husband can sell only the shares he bought with his money. The company shares can be sold only after the completion of 5 years (maturity period). Even then only the shares of first month will be mature. More shares will get matured each month. If he sells his shares now, the company shares given with those shares will be taken back from him. So, he doesn’t want to sell them now. My question is, Does he still has to give zakah on these shares?<br />\n2. Second question is, What is the nisaab of shares?<br />\n3. Third, he also has to pay tax and national insurance on these shares when he sells them. Does he have to pay zakah only on profit?<br />\n4. If we don’t have money now, can we pay it next year?<br />\n5. Do we’ve to pay for all 3 years?<br />\n6. The shares are in our joint name but only my husband deals with them, Who has the responsibility to pay zakah?<br />\nI’ll be really grateful, if you can answer me in detail, I am really concerned about the issue. I don’t want any haraam money in my home</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is obligatory to pay zakah on shares if the owner intends to sell them and they reached the nisaab (minimum threshold). He should work out their value each year, i.e., find out their market value, and pay one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) of their value.</p>\n<p>The nisaab is the equivalent of 595 grams of silver or 85 grams of gold. As silver is of lesser value, the nisaab should be worked out on the basis of silver, so as to give the poor their fair share.</p>\n<p>So if a person owns shares the value of which is equal to the value of 595 grams of silver, then he owns the minimum amount.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If a person acquires shares with the intention of benefiting from their dividends and profits, and he does not intend to sell them, then he does not have to pay zakah on the share itself; rather he has to pay zakah on the dividends, if he has taken possession of them and one zakah year has passed; he should pay one quarter of one tenth, or 2.5%, (of the dividend).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If the person does not have complete ownership of the shares, or he is not allowed to dispose of them, like the shares which the company has given to your husband, then he should pay zakah once when selling them or taking back their value, or when obtaining full possession of them by completing five years of work in that company.</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>zakah is obligatory upon the owner; if you have shares then you must pay zakah on them, and you are responsible for that, but the husband may voluntarily pay zakah on behalf of his wife.</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that taxes cannot take the place of zakah; every time one full hijri year passes, you should work out the value of the shares and pay zakah of one quarter of one tenth.</p>\n<p>With regard to the double shares, if your husband will take possession of them after five years and we said that your husband should pay zakah for one year when selling them, then he should pay zakah on what remains of their price after paying taxes and National Insurance, because in fact he does not possess anything other than that.</p>\n<p>Sixthly:</p>\n<p>If a person owns shares and works out their value at the end of the year, but he does not have cash with which to pay, it is permissible for him to delay zakah until he acquires cash or sells the shares, but he has to keep a record of that and write down what he owes of zakah for the first year, the second year and so on. But it is better to hasten to pay zakah and to be quick in doing good, and to make it easy for oneself, because if the amount of zakah accumulates, he may feel reluctant to pay it.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to bless you and to protect you from all harm.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Waswaas and suicide",
      "question": "<p>Although I observe my five daily prayers and I am practising (AlhamduliLAH) I experience serious waswas. This waswas is not normal e.g. shaytan telling me not to pray. At times I am close to commiting suicide just because of this, even though I am content and happy with what ALLAH has given me in this life. Subhan ALLAH my body moves or I am ready to jump on train tracks even though I am aware of the punishment of ALLAH to the one who commits suicide. This becomes very frighting later on when I reflect. Once I was sat on an edge/cliff and I began moving further and further towards the ocean until half my body was on the other side. AlhamduliLAH my brother pulled me and said are you crazy! I do not know what I was doing. Somthing was telling go furhter , go further. How can I overcome this fitna o brother in islam.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    You should understand that man is the one who produces his     waswaas and negative thoughts, and he is the one who causes himself to hear     these voices inside his mind. In most cases it is an echo of what he is     thinking about and the details thereof that preoccupy his mind, or it is a     reflection of the reality he is living, or it is an accumulation of past bad     experiences the effect and traces of which he has not been able to erase and     overcome (and he is still dwelling on them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But persuading yourself that you are helpless in the face of     these insinuating thoughts and that it is something beyond your control is     the most significant part of the dilemma; in fact this is one of the deepest     pits that humans in general fall into with regard to thought, reason and     contemplation. This is the difference between our father Adam (peace be upon     him) and Iblees. Adam (peace be upon him) admitted his sin, declared his     repentance, turned to Allah and was confident that he could overcome this     situation, so he and his wife said: “Our Lord! We     have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your     Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers” [al-A‘raaf 7:23].     In contrast, Iblees, may Allah curse him, blamed his Lord for his disbelief     and stubbornness, and behaved as if he was weak and helpless, unable to save     himself from the situation in which he found himself. He said, addressing     Allah (may He be glorified): “Because You have sent     me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your     Straight Path” [al-A‘raaf 7:16].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The remedy to this problem begins with realising that you are     able to deal with it and that it will be easy once you arm yourself with     resolve, determination and willpower, and follow the example of millions who     have gone through all kinds of problems and troubles, but they remained     steadfast and overcame their troubles, and became a cause of happiness for     those around them and brought development and success to their countries and     communities. You are not less significant than them and your trials are not     greater than theirs; rather it is nothing but a voice echoing inside your     mind. So let your reason be the thing that leads you and energizes you to     turn a deaf ear to these whispers, no matter how loud they are; the passage     of time will help to reduce this voice bit by bit, until it has diminished     completely, by Allah’s leave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Remember the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased     with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be     upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills     himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever.     Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the Fire of     Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have     that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for     ever and ever.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5778; Muslim, 109.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you ponder this hadeeth you will realise the seriousness     of the matter. There is nothing standing between you and this punishment     except the barrier of death, which could come at any moment. On the other     hand, there is nothing standing between you and the promise of paradise and     eternal happiness except the same barrier. So why choose for yourself     punishment and pain; why deprive yourself of eternal bliss? The Prophet     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is closer to one     of you than the strap of his sandal, and Hell is the same.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6488.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Whatever the case, the most beneficial and most powerful     remedy for all destructive psychological problems is the wisdom that Imam     ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) learned from his experience of     life. He used to say: Pay attention to your nafs, for if you do not     preoccupy yourself with the truth it will distract you with falsehood. The     truth with which you can preoccupy yourself requires a great deal of     sacrifice from us and from you. This world is full of different kinds of     good in which you can immerse yourself, so you will hardly have any thoughts     except thoughts about doing good things, and you will not pay attention to     anything but what those good deeds require. So this will be a means of     raising your status before Allah, may He be exalted, whilst also helping you     to overcome your psychological problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Finally, we also advise you to see a doctor or psychologist,     and do not take this matter lightly. Many doctors can reduce the impact of     (negative) ideas and thinking by means of medicines that correct hormonal     imbalances in the body. Many people have benefited from treatment by     trustworthy doctors, in addition to the spiritual and Islamic advice given     above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to grant you a speedy     recovery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Impact of devaluation of a currency on debts and stolen items",
      "question": "<p>If someone stole some money twenty years ago, should he return the same amount of money to the owner now, even though there has been severe devaluation in the value of the currency?<br />\nIs there a difference in the ruling between loans and other kinds of debt?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If it is proven that something must be repaid because of misappropriation, theft, or delay in paying off a debt, then it must be repaid according to its value on the day it was taken, because the one who misappropriated, stole or delayed repayment is a transgressor, so he is fully liable for any harm that resulted from his transgression.</p>\n<p>But if what was stolen was a specific item, then he is liable for any resulting loss in value.</p>\n<p>With regard to other debts, it makes a difference whether the change in the value of the currency is minor or major:</p>\n<p>If the change is minor and amounts to less than one-third of the debt, then the same amount must be returned, regardless of the current value.</p>\n<p>But if the change is major, and amounts to one third or more of the value, then the matter must be rectified by splitting the difference between both parties.</p>\n<p>If the value needs to be worked out, then it should be worked out on the basis of the price of gold at the time of the debt, or according to its purchasing value at that time, then it may be paid off in a currency other than that in which the loan was made.</p>\n<p>We have discussed this matter in detail, quoting the opinions of the scholars, in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/220839/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">220839</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/99642\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">99642</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible for one who is residing in a country where the days are very long to follow the timings of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his fasting and prayers?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for one who is residing in Sweden to fast and pray in Ramadan according to the timings of Saudi, or any Arab country that is close to him, or should he follow the timings of the country where he is living?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The one who is residing in Sweden or similar countries that are located     close to the North Pole comes under one of two headings:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -1-</p>\n<p>He     is residing in a city where night and day follow one another within a     24-hour period. In this case it is not permissible for him to fast or pray     according to the timings of another city; rather he must offer the five     daily prayers at the times stipulated according to Islamic teachings,     because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be     exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Perform As-Salat     (Iqamat-as-Salat) from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e. the Zuhr,     ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’an in the early dawn     (i.e. the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’an in the early     dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the     day and the night)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:78]</p>\n<p>    “When you     have finished As-Salat (the prayer - congregational), remember Allah     standing, sitting down, and lying down on your sides, but when you are free     from danger, perform As-Salat (Iqamatas Salat). Verily, the prayer is     enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”</p>\n<p>    [an-Nisa’ 4:103].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing in the verses or hadiths to differentiate between cases     where the day is long or short, so long as the timings of the prayers can be     distinguished according to the signs defined by the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for the beginning and end of the     times of the prayer. By the same token, it is obligatory for him to fast     during the day in Ramadan in full, whether the day is long or short, and it     is permissible for him to eat, drink and have intercourse during the night     that follows that day, whether the night is long or short, because Allah,     may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “and eat and     drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from     the black thread (darkness of night)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:187]</p>\n<p>    “It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your     wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts)…”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:187].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -2-</p>\n<p>If     a person is residing in a city where night does not follow day within a     24-hour period, such as a city where the day lasts for two days, or a week,     or a month, or more than that, such as the land where the sun does not set     in the summer, and does not rise in the winter, then such people have to     offer the five daily prayers within each 24-hour period, and they have to     work out the timings of them, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah     be upon him) instructed with regard to the day of the Dajjaal that will be     like a year, and his day that will be like a month, and his day that will be     like a week. So they should work out the timings for the prayers and the     fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We     have previously explained that working out those times should be based on     the nearest city in which the timings of the obligatory prayers can be     distinguished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information on the above, please see the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/106527\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">106527</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those who issued a     fatwa stating that those who are living in a city where the day is very long     may fast according to the length of the day in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia     made an obvious mistake and went against the Qur’an and Sunnah. We do not     know of any of the scholars who issued such a fatwa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Yes, with regard to those who live in a city where night and day do not     follow one another within a 24-hour period, such as a city in which the day     lasts for two days, or a week, or a month, or longer than that, the     contemporary scholars differed as to how the time of night and day are to be     worked out in a city in which night and day last longer than twenty-four     hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of them said that they should be regarded as equal, so the night should     be regarded as twelve hours and the day should be regarded as the same,     because this is the length of each in in average terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some said that the length of night and day in Makkah and Madinah should be     followed, because they are the two cities in which the revelation came down,     so the length of night and day should be based on what is known in those     cities, if it is not known how long night and day last in any given city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some said that the length of night and day in the nearest city in which     night and day follow one another within a 24-hour period should be followed.     This view is most likely to be correct, because connecting a city to that     which is geographically closest to it is more appropriate than connecting it     to one that is far away from it, because the closest one is more likely to     resemble it than any other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (19/309)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It     is well-known that the people in those cities experience difficulty in     fasting in the summer, because of the length of the day there, but Allah     will never cause the reward of their good deeds and their patience to be     lost. The reward for acts of worship is greater when there is more     difficulty in doing it, so long as the person does not deliberately make it     difficult for himself It is narrated in a hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be     pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) said to her, when she went out for ‘umrah: “Your reward will be     commensurate with your spending or your effort.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1787) and Muslim (1211).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     a person is unable to complete the fast because the day is too long, it is     permissible for him not to fast, and to make up the days on which he did not     fast on any day of the year in which he is able to make it up, even if that     day is two or three hours, as is the case in some cities.</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If fasting is too     difficult on very long days, and is unbearably difficult, and there is the     fear of physical harm or sickness as a result, then it is permissible to     break the fast in that case, and to make it up on shorter days, because     Allah, may He be exalted, says in the context of fasting (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make     things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number     (of days), and that you must magnify Allah (i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu-Akbar;     Allah is the Most Great) on seeing the crescent of the months of Ramadan and     Shawwal) for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>    “and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship,     it is the religion of your father Ibrahim (Abraham) (Islamic Monotheism). It     is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims both before and in this (the Quran),     that the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) may     be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind! So perform As-Salat     (Iqamat-as-Salat), give Zakat and hold fast to Allah (i.e. have confidence     in Allah, and depend upon Him in all your affairs) He is your Maula (Patron,     Lord, etc.), what an Excellent Maula (Patron, Lord, etc.) and what an     Excellent Helper!”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hajj 22:78]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward     for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil)     which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into     error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those     before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater     than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have     mercy on us. You are our Maula (Patron, Supporter and Protector, etc.) and     give us victory over the disbelieving people’”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:286].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (19/309)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     the times for some of the prayers can be determined and others cannot, then     it is obligatory to offer on time those prayers for which the time can be     determined, and whatever cannot be determined should be worked out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This can be seen in Sweden and neighbouring countries, in the case of ‘Isha’     prayer, as dawn breaks before the disappearance of the red afterglow which     signals the beginning of the time for ‘Isha’ prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The correct scholarly opinion is that they must pray ‘Isha’, and work out     the time for it, in contrast to some of the Hanafi scholars who said that it     is waived because the reason for it, namely the time, is not present. Please     see Maraaqi al-Falaah (p. 73)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In    Haashiyat ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ it says: If the sign for its onset is not     present and cannot be seen, as in Bulgaria, he is still obliged to offer     both of them. So he should work out the time for it, as it will be worked     out during the days of the Dajjaal, because it is proven in Saheeh Muslim     that (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) said: “Work it     out…” as-Sarkhasi and al-Balqaani issued fatwas stating that it will be     waived in their case, but others issued fatwas saying that it is still     obligatory, which is the correct view, by analogy with the days of the     Dajjaal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Haashiyat ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (1/468)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a city     in which the disappearance of the red afterglow, which signals the beginning     of the time for ‘Isha’, is very late, and it is difficult for them to wait     for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He     replied: If the red afterglow does not disappear until dawn breaks, or it     disappears for a length of time that is not enough to pray ‘Isha’ before     dawn breaks, then these people come under the same ruling as those who do     not have a time for ‘Isha’. They should work out a time for it based on the     nearest city to them which does have sufficient time for ‘Isha’. And it was     said that they should work it out according to the time of ‘Isha’ in Makkah,     because it is the Mother of Cities (Umm al-Qura).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     the red afterglow disappears a long time before dawn, allowing enough time     to pray ‘Isha’, then they must wait until it disappears. But if it is too     difficult for them to wait, then in that case it is permissible for them to     put ‘Isha’ together with Maghrib at the time of the earlier prayer, so as to     ward off hardship and difficulty, because Allah, may He be exalted, says     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make     things difficult for you”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>    “and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hajj 22:78].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In    Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be     pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) put Zuhr and ‘Asr together, and he put Maghrib and ‘Isha’ together, in     Madinah, when there was no fear and no rain. They said: What did he intend     by that? He said: He wanted not to cause any hardship for his ummah. In     other words, he did not want to cause them hardship by not putting prayers     together.</p>\n<p>    End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (12/206)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Surah 112, Al-Ikhlas, is recommended along with them, as well as the opening chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatihah. To cure black magic, some have successfully used seven lote-tree leaves. The leaves should be crushed, then mixed with water (enough for taking a bath). The following verses from the Quran are then recited: verse Al-Kursi (2:255), surah Al-Kafirun (109), surah 112, 113, 114; the verses which mention magic, which are: in surah Al-Baqarah (2:102), Al-A’raf (7:117-119), Yunus (10:79-82), and Taha (20:65-69).

      "title": "The imam got up for a third [rak‘ah] in Taraweeh, then added another [rak‘ah] to it, but there was someone behind him who was praying ‘Isha’",
      "question": "<p>I entered the mosque and they were praying qiyaam (Taraweeh), and it was the first rak‘ah. I had missed ‘Isha’ prayer, and I joined them in the first rak‘ah of Taraweeh, with the intention that I would do the first and second rak‘ahs [of ‘Isha’], then make up the remainder of the prayer. But when he finished the second rak‘ah, the imam stood up and did two more rak‘ahs, making a total of 4 rak‘ahs with one tashahhud. After the final tashahhud, he did the two prostrations of forgetfulness. My question is: is my praying ‘Isha’ in this instance a valid prayer? If it is not valid, what should I do?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to offer an obligatory prayer behind an imam who is offering a naafil prayer, and vice versa, according to the more correct scholarly view. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/153386\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">153386</a>.</p>\n<p>If the worshipper is praying ‘Isha’ behind an imam who is praying Taraweeh, then he should stand up after his imam says the tasleem and complete what remains of his prayer.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If a person prays ‘Isha’ behind (an imam who is praying) Taraweeh, that is permissible, then when the imam says the tasleem, he should stand up and complete the remaining two rak‘ahs. End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Majmoo‘ (4/168).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>What is prescribed in qiyaam al-layl (voluntary prayers at night) is to offer the prayers two [rak‘ahs] by two, because the Prophet (blessings and prayers of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayer is two [rak‘ahs] by two.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (993) and Muslim (749).</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad interpreted this hadith as meaning that that is obligatory. Hence he said that the prayer is invalid if the worshipper deliberately gets up for a third rak‘ah when praying qiyaam al-layl. Imam Ahmad said: Whoever gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in qiyaam al-layl, it is like his getting up for a third [rak‘ah] in Fajr.</p>\n<p>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/480).</p>\n<p>The majority of scholars are of the view that it is permissible to pray qiyaam al-layl four [rak‘ahs] by four, and they interpreted this hadith as either referring to what is recommended (mustahabb) and stating that that is preferable, or as meaning that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that because it is easier and lighter for the worshipper, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar stated in Fath al-Baari.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>If the imam prays three [rak‘ahs] in Taraweeh, what should he do?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>If he gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in Taraweeh by mistake, then he should sit down again; even if he has recited al-Faatihah, he should sit back down, and recite the tashahhud and the tasleem, then prostrate twice. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that if a man gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in the night prayer [qiyaam al-layl], it is as if he got up for a third rak‘ah in Fajr prayer, and it is known that if a man gets up for a third rak‘ah in Fajr prayer, he must sit back down, because Fajr cannot be offered with three [rak‘ahs], and similarly the night prayer cannot be more than two [rak‘ahs], because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are two by two.” I have heard that some imams, if they get up to pray a third [rak‘ah] by mistake and are reminded of it, they carry on and pray four [rak‘ahs]. This in fact is ignorance on their part, and is contrary to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The night prayers are two by two.” What should be done is, if a person is reminded in the night prayer or in Taraweeh, even if that is after he has started to recite [Qur’an, in the third rak‘ah], he must sit back down and recite at-tahhiyyaat, and say the tasleem, then do the two prostrations of forgetfulness, and say the tasleem again.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>Jalasaat Ramadaaniyyah.</p>\n<p>Based on that, this imam – when he remembered that this was the third [rak‘ah] – should have sat down, then done the prostration of forgetfulness at the end of his prayer.</p>\n<p>But what this imam did of making the prayer four [rak‘ahs] after getting up for a third [rak‘ah] by mistake is permissible according to some of the scholars.</p>\n<p>The Shaafa‘i scholars stated that one who gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in a naafil prayer by mistake should sit down, then do the prostration of forgetfulness.</p>\n<p>So if he decides that he wants to add something to his prayer after getting up, then the correct view in their opinion is that he should sit down, then stand up for the third [rak‘ah], so that he will have intended to do more before starting to do it.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars regarded it as permissible to form the intention of adding something to the prayer after getting up for it, and said that the worshipper does not have to sit down in that case.</p>\n<p>See: Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (1/271).</p>\n<p>Based on that, what the imam did is permissible according to some of the scholars, and if the imam does something that is permissible according to some of the scholars, based on his own ijtihad or following a scholar or thinking that it is valid, then his prayer is valid, and the one who is praying behind him must follow him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If the imam does something that in the view of the one who is praying behind him is forbidden in prayer, and it is a matter concerning which there are different views, the prayer offered behind him is valid. This is the well-known view narrated from Ahmad. He said: The reports narrated from Ahmad indicate the same thing; however, they appear to suggest that in every situation where it is certain that the imam made a mistake, then the prayer must be repeated, and when that is not certain, it does not have to be repeated. This is what is indicated by the reports and by usool al-fiqh. However, there are other scholarly views concerning this issue.</p>\n<p>Al-Ikhtiyaaraat (p. 70).</p>\n<p>Based on that, the imam’s prayer was valid, and your praying ‘Isha’ behind him was also valid.</p>\n<p>According to the view that adding to the prayer is not right in this situation, if the person praying behind him thought that it was permissible for the imam to do that, or he was unaware of the prohibition on following the imam in the additional rak‘ah, or he did that by mistake, his prayer is still valid.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

I know that we have different vieues on The Holy One who has made us.Yet I am a student of the scriptures, but also student to understanding. I have a daughter who married a muslim. I don't even know if I'm right in ,the case of calling my son-law a musilm. For he is a devoted to the teaching of the Koran. Lately I had a discussion with my daughter. Remember this I do not preach that she has made the wrong mistake, or try to force my oppinion on her.I love her,and my son -inlaw as well. I need to not preach what I believe,but my actions should show love. I thank you and all our brothers ,that we shall know the truth together. Again I hope and pray for peace. Yours in Loving of the Brotherhood</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We thank you very much for expressing these kind feelings. The fact that you have not stood in the way of your daughter and her husband in their following of Islam is indicative of your fair mindedness and respect for the beliefs of others. At the same time, we cannot hide our wish that you could join us and your daughter and her husband in following this religion, the great religion of Islam. We know that the matter may appear difficult, especially for a man who represents and studies another religion, but who knows, maybe this study will be followed by a proper study of Islam which will lead to a new conviction. We wish you well always, and pray that Allah will guide us all to the path of truth and guidance. Thank you once again.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I have been looking for work on the Internet for a very long time. In fact there are a lot of moneymaking websites, but most of them are prohibited because of what they involve of deceit and riba. So I decided to earn money through YouTube, then I realized that I have to connect my channel to Google AdSense, but the ads on AdSense may not all be permissible. So I decided to work with the company called freedom.tm, which belongs to YouTube Partners. What is the ruling on working with it; in other words, is the money that is collected from freedom.tm, which belongs to YouTube Partners, halal or haram?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">Firstly:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">There is nothing wrong with receiving money in return for putting ads on video clips that belong to you, subject to certain conditions:</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:left\">\n<li>That the subscription to the company should be free.</li>\n<li>That the financial return should be known.</li>\n<li>That the ads should be permissible, and should not include any promotion of things that are prohibited. If they do contain anything that is prohibited, it is not permissible to accept them and publish them, because that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [Al-Ma’idah 5:2], and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him in that, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him in it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4831).</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But if you cannot control these ads, and they contain prohibited things, it is not permissible for you to deal with this company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Secondly:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">It is clear from what we have read about this company that it is possible to increase your earnings by inviting people to subscribe, which is what is called referrals. If the new members do not have to pay any subscription fee, then there is nothing wrong with you receiving commission for inviting them and their joining the company, on condition that you make sure that the people whom you choose to invite will not accept unlawful ads.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">For more details, please see the answers to questions no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101806/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">101806</a> and <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/198784/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">198784</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>This question has been asked before, under No. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3402\">3402</a>, where it says: Credit cards are based on conditions of riba: if I delay repayment, they will impose a penalty on me, but in the place where I live in America, I cannot rent a car or a store or use many services without a credit card. If I do not use a credit card I will have a lot of problems and it will be unbearable for me. If I commit to paying it off by a certain time so that I will not pay any interest, is it permissible for me to use this card in the difficult circumstances in which I live? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He answered as follows: If it is certain that not using it is going to cause difficulty and the likelihood of you being late in paying it is remote, then I hope that there is nothing wrong with that. (Answered by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that two conditions are mentioned in the question: not using it should cause difficulty and he should have no other option but to use it; and the second condition is that he should be committed to paying it off without any delay.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If I give the iqaamah for prayer sitting or in another room other than the place where I am going to pray, is that allowed?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      The Sunnah is for the adhaan and iqaamah for prayer is to       be given standing. This is what the people have done from the time of the       Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the present day.       The one who gives the adhaan sitting or gives the iqaamah sitting with no       excuse has done a bad action and has gone against the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a matter on which the scholars are unanimously agreed     that there is no difference of opinion among them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/11):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is mustahabb for     the one who is reciting the iqaamah for prayer to do so standing, and it is     makrooh to do so sitting without an excuse, but if there is an excuse, there     is nothing wrong with it. … It is also makrooh to give the iqaamah whilst     walking or riding when travelling or otherwise without an excuse. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (15/264):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Giving the adhaan or iqaamah whilst sitting:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is makrooh for the     muezzin to give the adhaan whilst sitting except with an excuse, or if he is     giving the adhaan for himself, as the Hanafis and Maalikis say, because the     Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed Bilaal to     stand when he said: “Get up and give the call to prayer.” The muezzins of     the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to     give the adhaan whilst standing. And because standing makes the voice carry     further, and giving the adhaan and iqaamah whilst sitting is contrary to the     practice that has been handed down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Among the Hanbalis, Ibn Haamid said: If he gives the adhaan     whilst sitting, it is invalid. This was the view of Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen,     who said that the adhaan given by one who is sitting down is not acceptable.     And Abu’l-Baqa’ narrated that it should be repeated if he gave the adhaan     whilst sitting down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of one who has an excuse, there is nothing wrong     with him giving the adhaan whilst sitting. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-‘Abdi     said: I saw Abu Zayd, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him), whose legs had been injured (in jihad) for the     sake of Allah, giving the adhaan whilst sitting. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Sunnah is not to walk whilst giving the iqaamah, and to     give the iqaamah in the place where one is going to pray, so that there will     not be an interval between the iqaamah and starting the prayer, and because     the iqaamah is an announcement that the prayer is about to begin. So one     should start to pray immediately after reciting the iqaamah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad said in his Masaa’il     (61/220): I said to my father: Can a man walk whilst saying the iqaamah? He     said: I like him to stay where he is. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ishaaq ibn Raahaywayh said: As for the muezzin, once he     starts to say the iqaamah, if he is the imam, he should not walk during the     iqaamah until he finishes it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Masaa’il al-Imam Ahmad wa Ishaaq,     2/836&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",
