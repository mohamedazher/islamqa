      "title": "Her parents are refusing to have an Islamic celebration; what should she do?",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on an Islamic celebration if the parents do not agree? Do I have the right to object to them or should I agree to what they say and give it up?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by an Islamic celebration is a party that is held in accordance with Islamic guidelines, so that it is free of the evils of mixing and women showing their adornments in front of men, and using music and immoral singing, and other things that Allaah has forbidden. These haraam things, unfortunately, are widespread in many Muslim celebrations nowadays, except for those on whom Allaah has mercy. What is prescribed with regard to wedding parties is to bring joy and happiness to both bride and groom and their families and those who come to congratulate them in ways that do not incur the wrath of Allaah, such as using the duff (a kind of hand drum) among women, and their singing for one another using words that carry beneficial meanings and are free of sin. Al-Bukhaari (5163) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that she presented a woman as a bride to an Ansaari man, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: “O ‘Aa’ishah, did not have any entertainment? For the Ansaar are fond of entertainment.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Majaah (1900) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‘Aa’ishah arranged a marriage for a female relative of hers among the Ansaar, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and said, “Have you taken the girl [to her husband’s house]?” They said, Yes. He said, “Have you sent someone with her to sing?” She said, No. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The Ansaar are people with romantic feelings. Why don’t you send someone with her to say, ‘We have come to you, we have come to you, may Allaah bless you and us’?” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1995).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nasaa’i (3369) and Ibn Majaah (1896) narrated that Muhammad ibn Haatib said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What differentiates between haraam and halaal is (beating) the daff and raising the voices (in song) at the time of marriage.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wedding parties in Islam are parties which combine bringing of joy and happiness to those present with modesty, dignity and avoidance of haraam things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Women should celebrate the wedding separately from men, and do what is appropriate to them to bring happiness to the wife and the people around her, such as providing entertainment, telling jokes and singing to the accompaniment of the duff, and eating and drinking, and doing other things that may vary according to customs and traditions, so long as it is within the circle of permissibility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same applies to the men; they should gather in a separate place and exchange congratulations, and pray for blessing for the couple. It is Sunnah for the husband to offer food to be eaten by those present, without any extravagance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aim behind wedding parties is to announce the marriage and to make it distinct from haraam relationships, and to bring happiness to the couple, their families and friends, whilst attaining true submission to Allaah in all of that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the parents refuse to adhere to shar’i rulings in the wedding party and they insist on including some evils, such as allowing mixing or wanton display (tabarruj), or bringing a female singer or dancer to perform in front of men, then you have to advise them, and explain the shar’i ruling on such evils, and remind them that marriage is a blessing from Allaah for which they should give thanks, and gratitude is to be shown by obedience, not disobedience, and the marriage that begins with sin is unlikely to be blessed. If they respond, then praise be to Allaah, but if they persist in their view, then keep away from the place of evil [?] and announce your dislike and disavowal of it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’ 4:140]</p>\n<p>al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is obligatory to avoid people who commit sin if they do any evil action openly, because the one who does not avoid them is approving of their action. Allaah says “certainly in that case you would be like them”, so everyone who sits in a gathering where sin is committed and does not denounce it will share an equal burden of sin with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should denounce them if they speak of sin or do it; if he is not able to denounce them then he should leave them so that he will not be one of the people mentioned in this verse. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim (49). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11446\">11446</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7577\">7577</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You do not have to agree to the evil, or give up your stance of adhering to the rulings of sharee’ah in weddings and otherwise, in order to be among the victors who are blessed in this world and in the Hereafter. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to guide you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Can he tell lies to his parents in order to increase their good deeds?",
      "question": "<p>When I get some money from my father or mother, I give it in charity and keep a little. When I ask them for money they say, “Where did your money go?” I tell them a lie and say that I bought stuff with it. The reason why I tell this lie is that I want Allaah to increase their good deeds. Is it permissible for me to lie to them or should I tell them the truth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      The basic principle concerning telling lies is that it is       one of the signs of the hypocrites, because the Prophet  (peace and       blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are       three: when he speaks, he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and       when he is entrusted with something he breaks that trust.” Narrated by       al-Bukhaari, 32; Muslim, 89.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But there are some instances in which Islam permits lying, if     that serves a greater purpose or wards off a greater harm:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    These cases include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-When a person is intermediating     in order to bring about reconciliation between two disputing parties.</p>\n<p>    2-When a man speaks to his wife,     or a wife to her husband, concerning matters that will increase the love     between them.</p>\n<p>    3-War.</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from Umm Kulthoom bint ‘Uqbah that she heard     the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     say: “He is not a liar who brings about reconciliation among people, conveys     good words and says good things.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2546; Muslim, 2605&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Asma’ bint Yazeed said: The Messenger of     Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Lies are not     appropriate except in three cases: when a man speaks to his wife to please     her, telling lies at times of war, and lying in order to bring about     reconciliation between people.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Albaani said: it is hasan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What you have mentioned is no excuse for telling lies to your     family. If you are honest with them they will never be deprived of the     reward for spending on you. And you can combine your family’s spending on     you and their giving in charity to the needy by encouraging them to spend     for the sake of Allaah, with no need to tell lies about buying stuff when     you have not done so. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to correct your intention and set your affairs     straight, and to reward you greatly for your desire to benefit your family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "His wife’s family stipulated that he has to become rich before they will send his wife and children back to him",
      "question": "<p>I am suffering from many problems with my wife’s family. I married their daughter thinking that they were religiously committed, then I found out that they adhere to customs and traditions (rather than religion). They took my wife from me by force and I am have no power or status in this world, there is no power and no strength except with Allaah. She gave birth in their house and now they do not want to send my daughter or my wife back to me unless I become very rich. Please note that they have given my wife the choice between going with me and they will be angry with her, or staying with them until I become rich. My wife knows that I am in the right and they are in the wrong, but they are following their ways. What should I do according to Islam?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wife has     no right to go out of her husband’s house without his permission, and her     family have no right to help her or encourage her to do that, because her     leaving and not returning constitute disobedience towards her husband and     rebellion against him which makes her guilty of nashooz (wilful defiance).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their taking     their daughter away is another act of wrongdoing, and their stipulating that     you must become very rich before they will return your wife to you is     wrongdoing upon wrongdoing. They have no right to do any such thing. When     they accepted the marriage and the marriage contract was done and the     husband paid the mahr, they were obliged to hand the wife over to the     husband, so how about when she was with him and had borne him a child!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You do not     say anything about your financial situation, and whether you have enough to     spend on your wife or not. Are you hard up or do you have enough to spend on     yourself and your family? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority     of scholars are of the view that the husband’s inability to spend on his     wife is sufficient grounds for separating them, if the wife requests that.     But if she accepts it and does not ask for separation, then no one has the     right to separate them. See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/254 and     29/58).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should     take the following steps to get your wife back:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-Reconcile between yourself and     Allaah, may He be exalted, so that you can reconcile between yourself and     other people.</p>\n<p>    2-Ask Allaah to divert harm from     you, and to suffice you against the evil of all evildoers.</p>\n<p>    3-Try to reach an understanding     with your wife’s family and find out what their attitude really is. They may     have other reasons apart from the issue of wealth.</p>\n<p>    4-Appoint religiously committed     and righteous people to intervene and advise them, and explain to them the     seriousness of their wrongdoing and aggression.</p>\n<p>    5-Refer the matter to the courts,     to have your wife and daughter returned to you.</p>\n<p>We ask     Allaah to make things easy for you and to help you to do that which He loves     and which pleases Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah     knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Will her deceased husband be punished because his mother delayed giving his wife her due share of the inheritance?",
      "question": "<p>My husband died before the marriage was consummated, and I have an inheritance with his mother, but she is depriving me of it and will not give me the value of that share. Almost one year has passed; am I obliged to give zakaah on it? I do not know how much it is.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, will my husband be punished or kept from being granted bliss in his grave because of the delay in sharing out of the inheritance? In order for him not to be punished, do I have to let him off with regard to my mahr and my inheritance?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Taking possession and gaining ownership of the wealth is one of the       conditions of zakaah being obligatory; there is no zakaah on wealth when       possession and ownership thereof is not established, because when       possession and ownership are not established, the owner of the wealth       cannot dispose of it in his own interests, so it is more appropriate that       no one else should be entitled to any rights over it before possession and       ownership are established.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My     father died – may Allah have mercy on him – and he left behind in his estate     some money that was deposited in bank accounts. Because the division of this     money to the heirs was not completed until after more than two years had     passed since the death of our father for a number of reasons, some of which     were beyond our control and others were due to the fact that some of the     heirs live abroad and were late in appointing someone to attend court, and     it took some time for those banks to decide about division of the estate, no     zakaah has been paid on that money since the death of our father, may Allah     have mercy on him. As a little more than two years have passed since then,     should the zakaah be paid on the shares of all the heirs put together or     should it be paid on each share on its own, and what is the rate of zakaah?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The committee replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     the situation is as described, then no zakaah is due on the wealth of your     father for the two years during which the estate was not divided, because it     was not possible for each of the heirs to take possession of his share, for     reasons that were beyond the control of the heirs, and because some of the     heirs were far away and they were scattered, which was a cause of the delay     in the division of the estate being carried out, as you mentioned. So the     share of each heir comes under the ruling on wealth the ownership of which     is not established, and one of the conditions of zakaah being valid is that     possession and ownership should be established. But when each heir has taken     his share of the estate, if one full year passes and it reaches the minimum     threshold (nisaab), then zakaah becomes due at the rate of one quarter of     one tenth (2.5%). End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, you do not have to pay zakaah on any inheritance which you     have not been able to take possession of or have it at your disposal, or     know the value thereof, because your ownership is not established and you     are not able to dispose of it in your own interests or in the interests of     anyone else. If you do become able to take possession of it or dispose of     it, then you must pay zakaah on it from the time when you become able to     dispose of it, if it reaches the minimum threshold, when one full year has     passed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your husband will not be punished for what his mother does of delaying your     inheritance or depriving you of the inheritance to which you are entitled,     so long as he did not leave instructions to that effect or ask his mother to     deprive you of the inheritance, and he did not approve of that during his     lifetime, because he has no control over this wealth after his death. When     he died, it passed to his heirs and it is now the property of his heirs, and     is not his property. So he will not be accountable for what others do with     his wealth. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):    “On no soul does Allah place a burden greater than it can bear. He gets     reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that     (evil) which he has earned” [al-Baqarah 2:286].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (6442) narrated that Ibn Mas‘ood said: The Prophet (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Which of you loves the wealth of his     heir more than his own wealth?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, there is no     one among us but his own wealth is dearer to him than that of his heir. He     said: “Verily his wealth is that which he has sent on ahead (by spending it     in charity and good causes, so the reward for it is stored up for him), and     the wealth of his heir is that which he has kept back.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    After his death it is described as his heir’s wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Haafiz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Everything that the deceased leaves behind becomes the property of the heir.</p>\n<p>    End quote from Fath al-Baari (11/260)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please see also question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/117209\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">117209</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>This           is the view of some heretics and misguided people, both in the past           and nowadays. In modern times, those who expressed this view include           Saalih Abu Bakr in his book al-Adwaa’           al-Qur’aaniyyah; Husayn Ahmad Ameen in Daleel al-Muslim al-Hazeen; Ahmad Ameen in Fajr           al-Islam; ‘Abd-Allaah al-Na’eem in Nahwa Tatweer al-Tashree’&nbsp;           al-Islaami; Sa’eed al-‘Ashmaawi in Haqqeeqat           al-Hijaab; Saalih al-Wardaani in his misleading book Rihlati           min al-Sunnah ila al-Shee’ah; ‘Abd al-Jawaad Yaaseen in al-Sultah fi’l-Islam; Nasr Abu Zayd in Imaam           al-Shaafa'i; Zakariya ‘Abbaas Dawood in Ta’ammulaat           fi’l-Hadeeth; Hawlat Nahr in Diraasaat           Muhammadiyyah; Maurice Bucaille in&nbsp; Diraasat           al-Kutub al-Muqaddisah; Murtada al-‘Askar in Khamsoon           wa Mi’ah Sahaabi Mukhtalaq; Dr. Mustafa Mahmood in Maqaalaat           ‘an al-Shafaa’ah.</p>\n<p>We           say: it is true that there were fabricators and liars who made up words           and attributed them to the Messenger of Allaah            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but the matter is not quite           so simple as imagined by those doubters who also spread doubts among           others. They are unaware of the facts about how the Muslims took care           of the Sunnah. Alongside the fabricators, there were great numbers of           narrators who were trustworthy and highly skilled, and a large number           of scholars who surrounded the hadeeths of the Messenger of Allaah            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with a strong barrier which           was difficult for the liars to penetrate. By means of their vast knowledge           and deep insight, these muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth) were able           to spot the liars and understand their intentions and motives, and they           were able to detect everything that was falsely attributed to the Messenger           of Allaah  (peace and blessings           of Allaah be upon him). These fabricators were not given free rein to           do as they wished with the ahaadeeth of the Prophet            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they were given no           room to penetrate the ranks of trustworthy narrators of ahaadeeth without           being detected.</p>\n<p>Who           else exposed the lies of these kaafirs, heretics and extreme innovators?</p>\n<p>Who           were the ones who gave us the definition of what is fabricated, the           reasons for fabrication, different types of fabrications and the signs           by which a fabricated report may be recognized?&nbsp; Who wrote so many           books on this issue?</p>\n<p>They           are the guardians of Islam, the vicegerents and troops of Allaah on           His earth. They are the brilliant scholars of whom Haaroon al-Rasheed           spoke when he arrested a heretic and ordered that he be executed. The           heretic said, “Why are you executing me?” Haaroon al-Rasheed said, “To           rid the people of you.” The heretic said: “O Ameer           al-Mu’mineen, what will you do about the thousand ahaadeeth           – according to one report, four thousand ahaadeeth – which I have fabricated           and spread among you, in which I made what is halaal haraam and what           is haraam halaal, of which the Prophet uttered not one letter?” Haaroon           al-Rasheed said to him: “What will you do, O enemy of Allaah, about           Abu Ishaaq al-Fazaari and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak? They will go           through them and sift them letter by letter.” (Tadhkirat           al-Huffaaz by al-Dhahabi, 1/273; Taareekh           al-Khulafaa’ by al-Suyooti, p. 174).</p>\n<p>Professor           Muhammad Asad said: “The existence of fabricated ahaadeeth cannot be           taken to prove that the entire system of hadeeth is not to be trusted,           because these fabricated ahaadeeth never deceived the muhadditheen as           some European critics claimed, oversimplifying the matter, and as was           echoed by some who claim to be Muslims.” (al-Islam ‘ala Muftaraq al-Tareeq, p. 96) </p>\n<p>We will end this           discussion by quoting what was said by Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah:           Imaam Abu’l-Muzaffar al-Sam’aani said: “If they say: there are too many           reports in the hands of the people and they have become confused, we           say: no one is confused except those who are ignorant. Those who have           knowledge of them (the reports) check them as stringently as those who           deal with money check dirhams and dinars. So they single out (and discard)           the false reports and keep the good reports. If there happens to be           a narrator who made a mistake, this will not go unnoticed by the brilliant           scholars of hadeeth. These scholars listed the mistakes made in both           the isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (texts) of&nbsp; reports; so           you can see that for each narrator they made a list of the mistakes           that he had made and the letters that he had mispronounced. If the mistakes           of the narrators – in both the isnaad and the matn – did not go unchecked,           then how could the fabricated ahaadeeth manufactured by the heretics           have slipped past those brilliant scholars?&nbsp; How could people have           narrated ahaadeeth from heretics without the scholars noticing? That           is the view of some heretics, but no one would say such a thing except           one who is ignorant, misguided, an innovator and a liar who wants to           undermine the saheeh ahaadeeth and true reports of the Prophet            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and confuse ignorant people           by means of this lie. There is no evidence for rejecting the reports           of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace           and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that is weaker or more impossible           than this. The one who voices this view deserves to be silenced and           expelled from the Muslim lands.</p>\n",

      "title": "What should a Muslim son do for his kaafir father when he dies?",
      "question": "<p>My father has died and he is a kaafir. What are my responsibilities towards him? Should I bury him and arrange his funeral? Should I wash him and shroud him or not? Are there any rights that my father has over me in this respect?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that Naajiyah ibn Ka’b narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ‘Your old, misguided uncle has died (he was referring to his father Abu Taalib). Who will bury him?’ He said, ‘Go and bury your father.’ [I] said, ‘I will not bury him, for he died as a mushrik.’ He said, ‘Go and bury him, then do not do anything until you come to me.’ So I went and buried him, then I came to him with traces of dust and earth on me. He told me to wash myself, then he made du’aa’ for me in words that were more precious to me than everything on earth.”</p>\n<p>(al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, by al-Albaani, no. 161)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Shaykh said, commenting on this hadeeth:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – It is allowed for the Muslim to take care of the burial of his mushrik relatives. That does not cancel out his hatred of their shirk. Do you not see that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) initially refused to bury his father for that very reason, as he said, “he died as a mushrik.” He thought that if he buried him when this was the case, that this was included in the forbidden kind of friendship as referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allah”</p>\n<p>[al-Mumtahinah 60:13]</p>\n<p>When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) repeated the command to bury his father, he hastened to obey him and he gave up the notion that had initially occurred to him. This is what obedience means: that a person gives up his opinion in response to the command of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It seems to me that a son’s burying his mushrik father or mother is the last act of good companionship that the son can do for his mushrik parent in this world. But after the burial, he cannot make du’aa’ for him or pray for forgiveness for him, because of the unambiguous words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin”</p>\n<p>[al-Tawbah 9:113]</p>\n<p>If this is the case, then how can people pray for mercy and forgiveness in the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the kuffaar, in death announcements for money! Let the one who has any concern for his hereafter fear Allah.</p>\n<p>2 – It is not prescribed for him to wash or shroud a kaafir, or to offer the funeral prayer over him, even if he was a relative, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell ‘Ali to do that. If that were permissible, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have said so, because it is well known that it is not permitted for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to delay explaining something at the time when that information is needed. This is the view of the Hanbalis and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – It is not prescribed for the relatives of a mushrik to follow his funeral, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that in the case of his uncle, although he was the one who was the most kind and compassionate towards him, and he even prayed to Allah to make his punishment the lightest punishment in Hell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all of that there is a lesson for those who are deceived by pride in their lineage and who do not strive for their Hereafter with their Lord. Allah indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another”</p>\n<p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:101]</p>\n<p>al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albaani, p. 94</p>\n",

      "title": "Her father refused to marry her to someone so the judge did the marriage for her",
      "question": "<p>My father is Muslim.  He has wrong thoughts about Islam, such as his situation of hejab and mixing. He says: “will a person be judged if good or bad by his religiousness?”  He says also that none can implement all the commands of Allah, even the prophet (PBUH) himself could not, meaning the issue of polygamy. My sister has rejected Islam and became Christian, and my father did not object to this, he even sees her as better than me. My mother is Christian as well. <br />\n<br />\nA noble but disabled man has proposed to me and I accepted him. But my father refused him because he is disabled and from a simpler standard of living than ours. We are rich family. <br />\n<br />\nAfter I completed my study at university, my family planned to cut my relationship with the good friends of mine, they planned to change my life gradually. So I left home and planned for marriage. Two months later I got married to the Muslim man in a shar’ee court. <br />\n<br />\nThe question: is my marriage islamically valid? What should my situation towards my family be? Shall I continue boycotting the relationship with them?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We     praise Allaah for having enabled you to adhere to the path of guidance and     righteousness and we ask Him, may He be glorified and exalted, to grant you     more of His bounty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The woman should endeavour to marry one who is religiously committed and of     good character, who can protect her and take care of her, and enable and     help her to practise her religion, as well as help her to raise righteous     children in accordance with the principles and morals of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there     comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then     marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do     not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.”     Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1084) from Au Hurayrah; classed as hasan by     al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Marriage is not valid except with a wali (guardian), and a woman has no     right to marry herself, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage without a wali.” Narrated by     Abu Dawood (2085), al-Tirmidhi (1101) and Ibn Maajah (1881) from Abu Moosa     al-Ash’ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman     who gets married without the permission of her wali, her marriage is     invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid… and if there is     any dispute, then the ruler is the wali of the one who has no wali.”     Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi (1102); classed     as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 2709.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the wali refuses to marry the female relative under his care to a     compatible man with whom she is pleased, then he is preventing her from     getting married and guardianship passes from him to the next closest male     relative on the father’s side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by     preventing her marriage is preventing her from marrying a compatible man if     she asks for that and each of them wants to marry the other…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And whether she asked to get married for a mahr (dowry) like that of her     peers or less. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     she wants to marry a specific compatible man, and he wants her to marry some     other compatible man, and refuses to marry her to the one whom she wants,     then he is preventing her marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if she asks to marry someone who is not compatible, then he has the     right to refuse that and he is not regarded as preventing her marriage. End     quote from al-Mughni (9/383).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because guardians usually prevent marriage in such cases, there is nothing     wrong with the woman referring the matter to the shar’i judge, who may then     ask the guardians to do her marriage. If they refuse then he may do her     marriage himself. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) said, as in the hadeeth quoted above: “and if there is any dispute,     then the ruler is the wali of the one who has no wali.”     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this, your marriage contract is valid and it is not permissible to     annull it, because the shar’i judge became your wali after your father     refused to arrange your marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to honour your parents and treat them kindly, and uphold ties of     kinship with them even if it is only by speaking to them on the phone, until     they calm down and you are able to&nbsp; visit them, for parents’ rights are     great. Hence the duty to honour them is mentioned repeatedly in the Qur’aan,     as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his     parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything     (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me     is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do”</p>\n<p>    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his     parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and     hardship, and his weaning is in two years __ give thanks to Me and to your     parents. Unto Me is the final destination.</p>\n<p>    15.&nbsp;But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in     worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them     not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him     who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your     return, and I shall tell you what you used to do”</p>\n<p>    [Luqmaan 31:14, 15]</p>\n<p>    You have no right to cut them off, rather you must strive to calm them down     and put their minds at rest, and soften their hearts with money and gifts to     earn their love, and ask Allaah to guide your family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I got a letter from someone who said in it “By the life of the One who sent down the Qur’aan.” Is it permissible to swear using this phrase?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Swearing by the life of the     One Who sent down the Qur’aan is swearing by one of the attributes of     Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, namely the attribute of life. The     texts of the Prophet’s Sunnah indicate that it is permissible to swear by     the attributes of Allaah. These are saheeh texts which are narrated in the    Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, and the scholars quoted them as     evidence concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bukhaari (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on swearing by the     glory of Allaah and His attributes and words.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be     pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) used to say: “I seek refuge in Your glory.” Abu Hurayrah said that     the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man     will remain between Paradise and Hell and will say: ‘O Lord, turn my face     away from the Fire and by Your glory I will not ask You for anything     else.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be     pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said: “Allaah said: ‘You will have that and ten times as much.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Ayyoob (peace be upon     him) said: “By Your glory, I cannot do without Your blessing.” End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saheeh al-Bukhaari,    Kitaab al-Aymaan wa’l-Nudhoor (Book of Oaths and Vows), chapter no.     12. Although al-Bukhaari quoted these ahaadeeth as mu’allaq reports here, he     recorded their isnaads in full elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bayhaqi also     narrated these ahaadeeth in al-Sunan al-Kubra (10/41), and included     them in a chapter entitled:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on what was     narrated about swearing by the attributes of Allaah, such as His glory,     majesty, power, greatness, words, hearing and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under this title he     narrated a report from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), which     says that he was asked about alcohol and he said, “No, by the hearing of     Allaah, it is not permissible to sell it or to buy it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr     (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Swearing by the attributes     of Allaah is permissible and expiation is required [if the oath is broken],     because they are part of Him, may He be exalted. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Istidhkaar     (5/205)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Rushd (may Allaah have     mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for those who regard it     as impermissible to swear by the attributes and actions of Allaah, this is a     da’eef (weak) view. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bidaayat al-Mujtahid     (1/298).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn     Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that     swearing by His attributes is like swearing by Him, such as if he says “By     the glory of Allaah” or “By the life of Allaah” or “By the Holy Qur’aan”. It     is proven from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     and the Sahaabah that it is permissible to swear by the divine attributes     and the like. And swearing by His attributes is like seeking refuge in them,     and refuge can only be sought with Allaah, as in the words of Allaah, “I     seek refuge in Your countenance” and “I seek refuge in the perfect words of     Allaah” and “I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath” and so on. This     is something that is affirmed by the scholars. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Fataawa al-Kubra     (4/130).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is what has also been     stated by the fuqaha’ of the four madhhabs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Kaasaani al-Hanafi (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person says, “By the     glory of Allaah, by the greatness of Allaah, by His Majesty, by His pride”,     then he is swearing an oath, because customarily and usually when these     attributes are mentioned, what is meant is Allaah Himself. So what the     person who swears such an oath intends is to swear an oath by Allaah.     Similarly, people are used to swearing oaths by these attributes, and there     is no report to suggest that sharee’ah forbids swearing oaths by them. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’     (3/6).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever wants to swear an     oath, let him swear by Allaah” should not be understood as meaning that     permissible oaths are limited to swearing by this name only; rather the     ruling on all the names of Allaah is the same as the ruling on this name. So     if a person swears by al-‘Azeez (the Almighty) or al-‘Aleem (the     All-Knowing) or al-Qaadir (the All-Powerful) or al-Samee’ (the All-Hearing)     or al-Baseer (the All-Seeing), then it is a permissible oath. There is     scholarly consensus on this point. The same ruling applies to an oath sworn     by the attributes of Allaah, such as saying “By the glory of Allaah, by His     knowledge, by His power” and so on. This is a case where the focus is on the     attributes of Allaah. There should be no dispute, because these are oaths     like the first kind. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mufhim lima ashkala     min Talkhees Saheeh Muslim (4/623).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Zakariya     al-Ansaari, the imam of the Shaafa’is of his time (may Allaah have mercy on     him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An oath may be sworn by     saying “By the knowledge of Allaah, or by His power, or by His truth, or by     His greatness, or by His hearing, or by His sight,” and so on. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Asna’l-Mataalib Sharh     Rawd al-Taalib (4/244).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah the imam of     the Hanbalis of his time (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Swearing by the attributes     of Allaah, may He be exalted, is like swearing by His names. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mughni     (9/395).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with     swearing an oath by saying “By the life of Allaah”, because oaths may be     sworn by Allaah, and by any of His names, or by any of His attributes, such     as life, knowledge, glory, power and so on. So it is permissible for one who     is swearing an oath to say: “By the life of Allaah, by the knowledge of     Allaah, by the glory of Allaah, by the power of Allaah” and other attributes     of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.
