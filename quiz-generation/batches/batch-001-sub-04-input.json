      "title": "Are You Allowed to Pray in the Bathroom?",
      "question": "<p>I reverted to Islam a few years ago alhamdulillah. My parents despise it. They will not let me pray and they cause me much grief. They make me cry a lot when they attack me verbally. I try to uphold my family ties. When it is time to pray I try to leave the room and they will not allow it. So sometimes I have had to resort to praying in the bathroom because I fear I will miss it if I don't. I'm aware it is haram but it is the only place they cannot see me doing it. If they catch me praying anywhere else I fear they will hurt me or attack me mentally. What can I do?</p>\n",

Rather the individual should offer the prayer according to his ability, standing or sitting or lying down. He may even offer the prayer by means of gestures whilst walking if he is fleeing from a wild animal or flood. So long as he is of sound mind, the prayer is not waived for him. If it is difficult for him to pray at any time, <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/147381/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it is permissible for him to put Dhuhr and `Asr together</a>, and to put Maghrib and `Isha’ together. This is by the grace and mercy of Allah.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Praying_in_Difficult_Circumstances_Combining_Prayers_for_Ease\">Praying in Difficult Circumstances: Combining Prayers for Ease</span></h3>\n<p>Based on that, <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">if your family’s seeing you pray will result in obvious trouble for you</a>, such as being beaten or thrown out or shunned, then it is permissible for you to put Dhuhr and `Asr together, and to put Maghrib and `Isha’ together, at the time of the earlier or later prayer, according to whatever is easiest for you, because putting prayers together is permissible for many reasons, <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/153665/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including travel</a>, sickness, rain, fear for oneself or one’s property, and to relieve one of hardship and difficulty.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Why_is_Praying_in_Bathrooms_Prohibited_in_Islam\">Why is Praying in Bathrooms Prohibited in Islam</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14506/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As for praying in the bathroom, that is not allowed</a>, whether it is a place that is only for bathing or it is a place for relieving oneself, because it is the abode of the devils and the place where `Awrahs are uncovered.</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (317), Abu Dawud (492) and Ibn Majah narrated from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “All the earth is a place of prayer except graveyards and bathrooms.” The Hadith was classed as authentic by Ibn Hibban and Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Praying_in_Exceptional_and_Extreme_Situations\">Praying in Exceptional and Extreme Situations</span></h3>\n<p>This Hadith indicates that prayers offered in the bathroom are not valid, hence it is not permissible to do that except in the case of necessity, such as if the harm that will befall you from your parents is extreme and you cannot pray anywhere else, even by putting prayers together as mentioned above. In that case, it is permitted for you to pray in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a Christian boy who became Muslim secretly and feared trouble for the sake of his religion if his family found out that he had become Muslim, and he is a young student in school. He does not have a place to pray and he is afraid that if they find out about him, they may send him to a non-Muslim country or try to make him give up his religion, and he is a person who cannot be steadfast because he is still young. Is it permissible for him to pray in the bathroom?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>It seems that there is nothing wrong with it if he cannot find any other place. If he prays in front of them they may find out about him and try to make him give up his religion. If he cannot find any other place then there is nothing wrong with it, but he may find another place, or he may find a place for some of the prayers and not for others. Hence if he can find another place then he has to pray there, because praying in the bathroom is not allowed, as <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140208/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it is forbidden to pray in graveyards and bathrooms</a>. But if he cannot find any other place, he should not omit the prayer. (End quote)</p>\n<p>See also the lecture: Mashakil wal-Hulul by Shaykh Munajjid.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should a traveller offer the prayers in shortened form in his house or pray in congregation in the mosque?",
      "question": "<p>If I stay in a city for a temporary period whilst travelling, is it better to offer the prayers in shortened form in my house or to offer them in complete form in congregation in the mosque?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Prayer in congregation is obligatory and it is not permissible for a Muslim not to do that unless he has an excuse. We have already quoted the evidence for that from the Quran and Sunnah. Please see question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8918\" target=\"_blank\">8918</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, you have to offer the prayers in congregation in the mosque. If the imam is a resident (is not travelling) then you should offer the prayer in full with him, and not shorten it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked: If a person travels to Jeddah, for example, is he allowed to shorten his prayers or does he have to pray with the congregation in the mosque?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the traveller is still en route, it does not matter, but if he has reached his destination then he should not pray on his own, rather he has to pray with the people and offer the prayer in full. But if he is still on the road and is alone and the time for prayer comes, there is nothing wrong with him praying on his own and shortening the prayers whilst travelling, making the four-rakah prayers two rak’ahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’iah li’l-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (12/297).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: when and how should a traveller pray?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The traveller may pray two rak’ahs from when he leaves his city or town, until he returns to it, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the prayer was first enjoined it was two rak’ahs, then the prayer of the traveller remained like that but the prayer of one who is not travelling was increased to four.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1090; Muslim, 685. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Madeenah to Makkah, and we prayed two rak’ahs each time, until we came back to Madeenah. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1081; Muslim, 693.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if a traveller prays with an imam he should pray four rak’ahs, whether he catches up with the prayer from the beginning or he misses part of it, because the general meaning of the Prophet’s words: “When you hear the iqaamah, then walk to the prayer, and you should be tranquil and dignified, and not rush. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 636; Muslim, 602. The general meaning of the phrase “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it” includes travellers who pray behind an imam who is offering a four-rak’ah prayer, and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked why a traveller should pray two-rak’ahs when he is alone and four when he prays behind a resident. He said: “That is the Sunnah.” Narrated by Muslim, 688; Ahmad, 1865. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The obligation to pray in congregation is not waived for the traveller, because Allah has enjoined that even in the case of fighting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salaah (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you…”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:102]</p>\n<p>Based on this, if the traveller is in a city or town other than his own, he has to attend prayers in congregation in the mosque if he hears the call to prayer, unless he is far away or fears that he may miss meeting up with his travelling companions, because of the general meaning of the evidence which indicates that the one who hears the adhaan or iqaamah is obliged to pray in congregation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 15/252.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was also asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I am travelling and I hear the call to prayer, do I have to pray in the mosque? If I pray in the place where I am staying, is there anything wrong with that? If the duration of my trip is more than four consecutive days, should I shorten my prayers or offer them in full?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: If you hear the adhaan when you are in the place where you are staying, then you have to attend the mosque, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who asked him for permission not to pray in congregation: “Can you hear the call?” He said, “Yes.” He said: “Then answer it.” Narrated by Muslim, 6533. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp; “Whoever hears the call and does not come, there is no prayer for him (i.e., his prayer is not valid), except for one who has an excuse.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 217; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no evidence to indicate that this ruling applies only to the traveller, unless your going to the mosque will cause you some problems in your journey, such as if you need to rest and sleep and you want to pray in the place where you are staying so that you can sleep, or you are afraid that if you go to the mosque the imam will delay the prayer, and you want to leave and you are scared that you may miss the train or plane, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 15/422.</p>\n",

He will say, `O Lord, bring me closer to that tree so that I may be in its shade… Then he will enter his house [in Paradise] and his two wives from among <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/257509\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Al-Hur Al-`Iyn</a> will come in and will say to him, `Praise be to Allah who brought you to life for us and brought us to life for you.’ Then he will say, `No one has been given what I have been given.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 275)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Among the blessings that Allah has prepared for His slaves are <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/160958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Al-Hur Al-`Iyn</a> .

And We shall marry them to Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes.” [At-Tur 52:20]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Al-Hur Al-`Iyn are extremely beautiful, such that the marrow of their shins will be visible from beneath their garments. Every man who enters Paradise will have two wives from among Al-hoor Al-`iyn.

Like unto preserved pearls.” [Al-Waqi`ah 56:22-23]</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first group will enter Paradise looking like the moon on the night when it is full, and those who follow them will be like the brightest shining star in the sky. Their hearts will be as one, and there will be no hatred or jealousy among them. Each man will have two wives from among <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Al-Hur Al-`Iyn</a> , the marrow of whose calves can be seen from beneath the bone and flesh.” (Narratedby Al-Bukhari, no. 3014)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: `Going out and coming back for the sake of Allah is better than this world and all that is in it. And a spot the size of the bow of one of you in Paradise – or a spot the size of his whip – is better than this world and all that is in it. If a woman from among the people of Paradise were to look at the people of this earth, she would light up all that is in between them and fill it with fragrance. The veil on her head is better than this world and all that is in it.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2587)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_have_sex_in_Jannah\">Can you have sex in Jannah?</span></h3>\n<p>A man will have intercourse in Paradise with his wives from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn and his wives from among the people of this world, if they enter Paradise with him. A man will be given the strength of a hundred men to eat, drink, feel desire and have sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer in Paradise will be given such and such strength for sexual intercourse.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, will he really be able to do that?” He said, “He will be given the strength of one hundred (men).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2459. He said, it is authentic)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It was narrated from Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man among the people of Paradise will be given the strength of a hundred men for eating, drinking, desire and sexual intercourse. A man among the Jews said, `The one who eats or drinks needs to excrete!’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: `The excretion of any one of them will be in the form of sweat which comes out through his skin, then his stomach will reduce in size again.’” (Narrated by Ahmad, 18509 and Ad-Darimi, 2704)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Quran commentators said concerning the phrase “busy in joyful things” (Ya-Sin 36:55 – interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;`Abdullah ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), and Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Al-A`mash, Sulayman At-Taymi and Al-Awza`i said concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning),</p>\n<p>“Verily, the dwellers of Paradise, that Day, will be busy in joyful things” [Ya-Sin 36:55]</p>\n<p>they said, (it means) they will be busy deflowering virgins. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, according to a report narrated from him, that “busy in joyful things” means listening to stringed instruments. Abu Hatim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he misheard the phrase Iftidad Al-Abkar (deflowering virgins) and thought it was Sama` Al-awtar (listening to stringed instruments). In fact the correct phrase is Iftidaad Al-Abkar (deflowering virgins). (Ibn Kathir, 3/564)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_have_children_in_Jannah\">Can you have children in Jannah?</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to children, the scholars differed as to whether <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">children would be born as a result of this intercourse or not</a> . Some said that there would be children if the man wants them, but the pregnancy and birth would take just one hour.</p>\n<p>Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the believer wants a child in Paradise, the pregnancy and delivery will take only an hour, then the child will be the age that the man wants.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2487; Ad-Darimi, 2712; Ahmad, 11339; Ibn Majah, 4329). And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to admit us to Paradise and to keep us far away from the Fire. May He bless us with the highest Firdaws, for He is the One Who is Able to do that.

      "question": "<p>Among some young people it is common to hang up flags and symbols of some non-Muslim countries, and we see them buying and keeping these things, printing them on shirts, pants, belts, glasses, hats, shoes, rulers, pens, rings and watches, and putting them on car seat covers and window decals. Some of them buy the complete flag and put it on the hood or trunk of the car. What is the ruling on buying and selling, keeping and hanging up these flags?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>One of the aims of Islamic sharia is that the Muslim should be distinct from all disbelievers and evildoers in terms of beliefs, attitudes, behaviour and thinking, and even in outward appearance and language too, and that he should cut off all ties of love, loyalty and support for anyone who disbelieves in Allah and His Messenger. There is a great deal of shar‘i evidence, both in the form of clear texts (of Qur’an and Sunnah) in the form of rulings derived from those texts, to support this basic Islamic principle, that warns lest one go against it or take it lightly by way of aping and imitating those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day, and do not regard as prohibited that which Allah and His Messenger prohibited. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then We have put you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) on a plain way of (Our) commandment (like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islamic Monotheism)). So follow you that (Islamic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not”</p>\n<p>[al-Jaathiyah 45:18]</p>\n<p>“Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) till you follow their religion. Say: \"Verily, the Guidance of Allah (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him) were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Quran), then you would have against Allah neither any Walee (protector or guardian) nor any helper”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:120]</p>\n<p>“and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) far away from some of that which Allah has sent down to you”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:49]</p>\n<p>“Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) to be affected by Allah’s Reminder (this Qur’an), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture (the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) before (i.e. Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened? And many of them were Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)”</p>\n<p>[al-Hadeed 57:16].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The verses that speak of this matter are many and well-known. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when he saw ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas wearing two garments dyed with safflower: “This is the clothing of the disbelievers, so do not wear it.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. It is proven in as-Saheehayn that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went against the way of the People of the Book with regard to leaving the hair loose, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the mushrikeen: let your beards grow and trim your moustaches.” Narrated in as-Saheehayn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadiths and reports from the righteous early generation concerning this matter are many and well-known.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the above it is known that a person cannot be following true Islamic teaching until his outward actions and inward beliefs are in accordance with the command of Allah and His Messenger. So his loyalty should be to Allah, His Messenger and his brothers in faith, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, your Walee (Protector or Helper) is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, - those who perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, and they bow down (submit themselves with obedience to Allah in prayer)” [al-Maa’idah 5:55]. The believers are obliged to disavow disbelief and its people, whether they are Christians, Jews, Magians, atheists or followers of any other path or religion that is contrary to Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to protect the basic principle mentioned above and to protect the Muslim and his Islam from deviation, the Islamic texts prohibit imitation of the disbelievers in matters that are unique to them, be that words, actions, clothes or general appearance, because that poses a danger to the belief of the Muslim, and lest it lead to him thinking well of the disbelief and misguidance that they follow. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been sent ahead of the Hour with the sword, until Allah alone is worshipped with no partner or associate; my provision has been placed beneath the shade of my spear, and humiliation and ignominy have been ordained for those who go against my commands; whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad and others with a jayyid isnaad. And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who imitates others; do not imitate the Jews or the Christians.” A hasan hadith; narrated by at-Tirmidhi and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the Islamic wisdom behind the prohibition on imitating the disbelievers and the obligation to differ from them in outward matters such as dress and the like:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah sent Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with wisdom, namely his Sunnah which is the way and path that He prescribed for him. Part of this wisdom is that He prescribed for him words and deeds that made his way distinct from the way of those who earn His anger and those who go astray, and He enjoined him to differ from them in outward appearance and practices – even if many people cannot see anything wrong with that – for several reasons, including the following:</p>\n<p>·Dressing and acting like them will generate feelings of commonality between those who resemble one another, which may lead to some degree of similarity in attitude and deeds. This is something obvious, because the one who wears the garments of fighting soldiers, for example, will find himself starting to behave like them to some extent, and his attitude will be influenced by that, unless something prevents it.</p>\n<p>·Being different in dress and behaviour will lead to differences and disconnection, which will result in refraining from that which incurs divine wrath and leads to misguidance, and will lead to joining those who are guided and with whom Allah is pleased. Thus the decree of Allah will be fulfilled, that His friends, who are the successful ones, will be allies of one another and His enemies, who are the losers, will likewise be allies of one another.</p>\n<p>The more a person’s heart is filled with living faith and knowledge of true Islam – I do not mean outward pretence or believing in general terms – the more he will feel distant, both outwardly and inwardly, from the Jews and Christians, and the further he will feel from their behaviour and attitudes that even some Muslims may have adopted.</p>\n<p>·Dressing and behaving like them outwardly leads to mixing with them, to the extent that the distinction is no longer there between those who are guided and with whom Allah is pleased, and those with whom Allah is angry and who have gone astray, and other reasons why we should be different.</p>\n<p>This has to do with behaving and dressing like them in ways that would otherwise be permissible, were it not for resembling them. But if it is the matter of behaving like them with regard to that which is part of their disbelief, then it is a branch of disbelief, and going along with them in that implies agreeing with one type of their sins. So this is something that one must be careful about. [End quote]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on the above, there is no doubt that one aspect of being allied with the disbelievers is imitating them and wearing clothes that bear their symbols, such as the cross and the like, being concerned with their pictures, supporting their sports teams, putting their flags on cars, houses and stores, using their names, calling people to love them and befriend them, being proud of belonging to them and to their prominent figures and leaders, and being impressed by their whims and desires that are contrary to Islam. (The Muslims who do that) do not realise that by doing this, they are demolishing one of the basic principles of Islam in their hearts and in the hearts of the Muslims, and they are exacerbating the weakness of the ummah. Verily to Allah we belong and to Him is our return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What all Muslims must do is adhere to the teachings of Islam and the straight path, and beware of deviating from that to the path of those with whom Allah is angry and those who are astray, namely the Jews, Christians and all other polytheists. The Muslims should encourage one another to be righteous and fear Allah, and to do everything that will bring goodness and glory to Islam and the Muslims; they should refrain from everything that may harm the Muslims or help their enemies against them, and they should refrain from propagating and spreading such things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

      "title": "Ruling on delaying zakaah and investing the wealth",
      "question": "<p>The annual zakaah on my wealth is a considerable amount (such as 10,000 Egyptian pounds). Previously I have usually given it to the poor or to build a hospital for the poor, etc, but now I am thinking of keeping the value of this zakaah for three or four years in a separate account that brings a suitable annual return in one of the Islamic banks, with the aim of generating a sum that will be suitable for establishing a non-profit centre for da’wah and education using the most modern methods of research and studying in this field for Muslims who begin to have doubts about their religion when they compare it with other religions. Then my annual zakaah will be given to this centre. This is in addition to donations that we hope will be given by other Muslims.<br />\n<br />\n Is this permissible according to sharee’ah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We would like to thank you for your protective jealousy     concerning your religion and for your concern about the Muslims’ situation,     but what you want to do and are asking about is not in accordance with     sharee’ah, because when zakaah becomes due, after one year has passed, it     must be paid immediately, and it is not permissible to delay it if one is     able to pay it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Zakaah is an act of worship and the Muslim must adhere to the     rulings on the amount on which zakaah is to be paid, when it is to be paid     and the types of wealth on which it must be paid; he does not have the right     to delay paying it once the time comes, unless he has an excuse which allows     that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If zakaah is due in Jumaada al-Oola, can we delay it until     Ramadaan with no excuse?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to delay paying zakaah after one year     has been completed unless there is a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as there     being no poor people around at the time when the year is complete, or not     being able to get it to them, or because the money is not accessible, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for delaying it     because of Ramadaan, that is not permissible unless it is only a short     period away, such as if the end of the year comes in the second half of     Sha’baan; in that case there is nothing wrong with delaying it until     Ramadaan. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’, 9/398&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to do business with zakaah wealth for     one who is obliged to pay zakaah, or for the institution that takes the     zakaah wealth and is entrusted with making sure it reaches the people who     are entitled to it. Rather it is obligatory to give it (in the manner     prescribed), and their investments should be made with wealth other than     zakaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about a     charitable organization that wanted to invest its wealth.&nbsp; They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the money mentioned     in the question comes from zakaah, then it must be given to the people who     are entitled to it according to sharee’ah when it reaches the charitable     organization. But if it is not zakaah, then there is no reason why it should     not be used for trade in the interests of the organization, because that     will increase the benefits that the charity aims to achieve.&nbsp; End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’, 9/403, 404&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They were also asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Can a global Islamic charity invest zakaah money that has     been placed in bank accounts until they are able to distribute it, when     investing it is not going to affect the way it is spent according to     sharee’ah, on condition that the investments be made in such a way that it     may be accessed easily in case of need, and in investments that have been     well studied and are reliable, but we do not say that they are guaranteed so     as to avoid anything haraam or doubtful, and on the basis that the charity     is not a person or persons representing themselves, rather it is a separate     entity, and the people in it are working and doing their best to find out     what is best for Islam and the Muslims?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible     for the charity to invest the zakaah money. What should be done is to spend     it in the ways prescribed in sharee’ah, after ensuring that the people     concerned are entitled to it, because the aim of zakaah is to meet the needs     of the poor and pay off the debts of those who are in debt, whereas     investment may cause these benefits to be lost or may delay them a great     deal for those who are entitled to them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’, 9/454, 455&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to giving zakaah to build a hospital for the poor     or some other charitable projects, we have stated in the answer to question     no. <a href=\"/en/answers/39211\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">39211</a> that zakaah is to be     spent on certain categories as prescribed in sharee’ah. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the     Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen(the poor) and those     employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have     been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in     debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a     holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from     everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tawbah 9:60]</p>\n<p>    So     it is not permissible to give zakaah to any categories other than these.</p>\n<p>    You     have to pay zakaah on time; it is not permissible to delay it when you are     able to pay it, or to invest that money, whether in profitable business     projects or in da’wah projects.</p>\n<p>    With     regard to the da’wah project of which you are thinking, you should try to     persuade whoever you can of the Muslims to finance it without using zakaah     funds.</p>\n<p>    May     Allaah help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.</p>\n<p>    And     Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The merits mentioned in the hadith are not specifically for    men. In fact, they are general for both men and women. If a young woman grows up in the    worship of Allah, she is included among them. Similarly, two women who love each other for    the sake of Allah alone are also included. Again, any woman who is invited to illegal    sexual intercourse by a man of nobility and beauty and she refuses his advances, saying,    \"I fear Allah,\" will be one of those in the shade of Allah.</p>\n<p>Any woman who gives in charity from her legal earnings to the extent that    her left hand does not know what her right hand has given will be included among them. If    a woman remembers Allah when she is alone by herself, she will be included among them like    any man. However, the righteous leader is something specific for men. Similarly,    performing the prayers in congregation in the mosque is something specific for men. The    prayer of the woman in her house is more virtuous as has been stated in the authentic    Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him). </p>\n",
