      "question": "He married her without the knowledge of his first wife, then his secret was found out, and he is still not giving her her rights with regard to his staying overnight with her.",
      "question_full": "I got married four years ago to a man who was already married and had a daughter. He told me that it would remain a secret to his wife and father, until they found out from people and not from him, and I agreed to that. From the day we married, he has not slept at my house except for one week, on the basis that he was travelling. After that he has not slept in my house and I have been living on my own, and he comes every day. I got pregnant from him and gave birth to a daughter, who is now two years old. Until today he has not registered her in his name, for fear that his wife will find out. I have been patient all this time and have said it doesn't matter, because frankly my husband is a man like no other and he loves me, but after 3 1/2 years his wife and his father found out, and she asked him to divorce me, but he refused to divorce me or to divorce her. But until now he is not treating us fairly, and he has never stayed the night with me and my daughter, and he has not registered his daughter in his name, and I do not know why. Even on Fridays it was hard for him to come and visit us; even when my daughter was sick at night, I could not tell him and I was always the one who took her to the hospital. I do not know what I should do. By Allaah, I always ask Allaah to give me patience because I have suffered all these years and I do not know for how long. Please note that my husband fears Allaah and does not miss a prayer, and he always does good. Every time I argue with him he tells me: &ldquo;Everything in its own good time; you have been very patient, can't you be patient for longer?&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope that you can help me because in fact I am not able to put up with this injustice any more.",

What he has to do \r\n    is to teach you and his first wife fairly with regard to spending the night. \r\n    However many nights he spends there, he has to spend the same number of \r\n    nights with you, and you have the right to demand this right which Allaah \r\n    has obliged him to give and that Allaah has given to you. If he persists in \r\n    refusing, then you have the choice: either you can accept your life with him \r\n    and put up with it until Allaah grants you relief -- which is what we \r\n    recommend -- or you can choose to leave him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As the matter has been discovered, we advise you to appoint \r\n    as an intermediary someone who has knowledge and is of good character, who \r\n    can intervene between you to resolve your problem with him and make him do \r\n    that which Allaah has obliged him to do of treating you and his first wife \r\n    fairly, and registering your daughter officially. This is something that is \r\n    essential. How can he accept for his daughter to remain like that, with no \r\n    recorded lineage and with her rights exposed to loss?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now the matter is up to you. Advise him and remind him of \r\n    Allaah, and if he does not respond, then appoint as intermediaries wise \r\n    people from among your family, or from among your family and his, to advise \r\n    him and make him adhere to that which Allaah has enjoined upon him of \r\n    treating his wives fairly and registering his daughter in the official \r\n    records.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ask Allaah to help and guide you and him. We ask Allaah to \r\n    bring you together on the basis of good and to make it easy for you to do \r\n    that which pleases Him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.</p><br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

Also he needs \r\n    to be able to have intercourse with her and be intimate with her at any time \r\n    that suits him, and that is not possible if a third person is present.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Badaa&rsquo;i al-Sanaa&rsquo;i&rsquo;</i>, 4/23.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by fairness in spending and clothing is that he \r\n    should spend on them as much as he can afford.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to fairness in spending and clothing, this is \r\n    also Sunnah, following the example of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him), He used to spend equally on his wives, and also used \r\n    to divide his time equally among them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa</i>, 32/269.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to \r\n    treat them equally as regards staying the night, spending time with them and \r\n    spending on them.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad</i>, 1/151&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to other things, it does not matter if he does \r\n    not treat them equally, such as giving a gift to one of them, or being more \r\n    inclined towards one of them in his heart, or giving her more clothing than \r\n    he is obliged to, or having intercourse with one of them more than another, \r\n    without intending to harm the other. But if he treats them all equally that \r\n    is better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He does not have to treat his wives equally in spending and \r\n    clothing if he does what he is required for each of them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ahmad said &ndash; concerning a man who had two wives &ndash; he has the \r\n    right to give one more than the other with regard to spending, desire and \r\n    clothing, if the other has enough, and he may buy a finer garment for her, \r\n    so long as the other has enough. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is because it is too difficult to treat them equally \r\n    with regard to all these matters, and if it were made obligatory he would \r\n    not be able to do it, except with great difficulty. This is why it is not \r\n    obligatory, such as treating them equally with regard to intercourse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni</i>, 7/232.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he gives each of them her rights with regard to clothing, \r\n    spending and spending time with them, then it does not matter if his heart \r\n    is inclined more towards one or if he gives one a gift&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari</i>, 9/391.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our companions said: If he treats them equally (in the \r\n    matters where that is required), he does not have to treat them equally with \r\n    regard to intercourse, rather he should stay overnight with all of them but \r\n    he does not have to have intercourse with each of them. He may have \r\n    intercourse with some of them when it is their turn for him to stay with \r\n    them and not others. But it is mustahabb for him not to neglect intimacy \r\n    with some of them and to treat them all equally in this matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh Muslim</i>, 10/46.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not know of any dispute among the scholars regarding \r\n    the fact that it is not obligatory to treat one's wives equally as regards \r\n    intercourse, which is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because \r\n    intercourse has to do with desire and inclination, and there is no way to \r\n    treat them equally in this regard. A man's heart may incline more to one of \r\n    them than the other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;You will never be able to do perfect justice between \r\n    wives even if it is your ardent desire&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:129]</i>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Ubaydah al-Salmaani said concerning love and intercourse:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you are able to treat them equally with regard to \r\n    intercourse, that is better, because it is more fair and just&hellip; But it is not \r\n    obligatory to treat them equally with regard to intimacy that is less than \r\n    intercourse, kissing, touching, etc, because if it is not essential to treat \r\n    them equally with regard to intercourse, then that applies even more to the \r\n    things that lead to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni</i>, 7/234, 235.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the husband going out when it is one wife&rsquo;s \r\n    turn, if that is because of some need and he does not intend to hurt her and \r\n    he is not going out to the other wife, there is nothing wrong with that in \r\n    sha Allaah. The basis of equal sharing of time is staying the night: he has \r\n    to spend most of the night with the wife whose turn it is. Allaah has not \r\n    created any hardship in religion, and it does not prevent the husband from \r\n    going out or going shopping or attending classes during the time of one of \r\n    his wives, if he does not intend to hurt her by going out, and he does not \r\n    spend most of the night outside the house of the wife whose turn it is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Dr Ahmad Rayaan said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars have spoken in strict terms about \r\n    fairness in dividing his time, and they say that everyone who goes against \r\n    that is not treating his wives equally. Some of them even say that if he \r\n    comes to the first wife after sunset and to the second after &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, he is \r\n    not treating them equally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What that means is that the husband must finish with all his \r\n    business during the day, before the sun goes down, so that he can control \r\n    the time when he goes to his wives each day, so that he goes at a specific \r\n    hour each day. That may have been possible in the past when life was simpler \r\n    and there were less necessities and people could live with less. But it is \r\n    not possible now. How many men now can regulate their movements in such a \r\n    way as to make sure they enter the house before the sun goes down each day, \r\n    so that their division of time and their spending the night with each wife \r\n    is completely equal?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Rather it is more appropriate to suggest that he must spend \r\n    most of the night in the house, without specifying the time when he should \r\n    come in or go out, because his living circumstances or other people&rsquo;s rights \r\n    or the pursuit of knowledge and other circumstances may require him to go \r\n    home late or leave home early. So what matters is that he should stay with \r\n    the wife whose turn it is for most of the night, because the point of \r\n    staying with his wife is to keep her company and be intimate with her, which \r\n    can be achieved by the husband spending most of the night with her. We have \r\n    seen from the ahaadeeth quoted above the way in which this division of time \r\n    was achieved in the family of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him. The fact that he visited his other wives by night or by \r\n    day, or met with them in the house of the wife whose turn it was did not \r\n    contradict this fair division of time, even though it is well known that \r\n    these visits and meetings might detract somewhat from the rights of the wife \r\n    whose night it was, because it took some of her own time, and she had the \r\n    exclusive right to this time where the others did not. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence I think that what matters with regard to the issue of \r\n    dividing the husband&rsquo;s time among his wives is that he should spend most of \r\n    the night with her whilst stipulating that his coming late should not be \r\n    done with the intention of harming the wife whose night it is, rather it is \r\n    the result of the husband&rsquo;s everyday work. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

If the situation is as you \r\n      describe, there is no blame on you for that in sha Allah, because of the \r\n      report narrated by Jareer ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allah who said: I asked the Messenger \r\n      of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about an accidental \r\n      glance and he told me to avert my gaze.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Muslim, 2159.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant \r\n    by an accidental glance is when his gaze falls upon a non-mahram woman \r\n    accidentally; there is no sin on him for the first glance but he has to \r\n    avert his gaze immediately. If he averts his gaze immediately, there is no \r\n    sin on him, but if he continues to look then he is sinning, because of this \r\n    hadeeth.

      "question": "She was put under pressure and forced to steal from her maternal aunt.",
      "question_full": "I want to tell you about a problem in the hope that you can help me. I am a young woman, twenty years of age, religiously-committed and educated, from a religiously-committed and very conservative family. I live with my mother and sister, as my father died four years ago, and my only brother died three years before that. I fell victim to a friend who betrayed me and managed to take a picture of me without my knowledge, then she took me by surprise when she tinkered with my picture by using a computer programme and put my head on the body of a woman who was in a very immoral situation, and she demanded that I give her 5000 or she would send the picture to my mother. That evil woman knew that my mother suffers from spasms in her chest because of grief, and she said to me literally: &ldquo;If you do not give me the money, I will send the picture to your mother and she will have a heart attack and die like your father and brother.&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI admit that I was na&iuml;ve and I did not handle it well because I was so afraid for my mother and her feelings. She threatened me on the day when we were going to visit my maternal aunt, and I went into my female cousin&rsquo;s room to pray, and I saw her bracelets, necklaces and jewellery, and I thought of stealing as something that came under the heading of necessity that makes forbidden things permissible. I said to myself: I will only take the chain because its value is sufficient for me, even though the jewels were in front of me, and I thought that if I took something from my own house and stole, my mother would find out, so I resorted to stealing from my aunt&rsquo;s house. We have a very good relationship with this aunt and she is the dearest and closest of people to us. The only reason why I stole from my aunt&rsquo;s house was that I could return what I had stolen to my aunt in the form of a gift in the future or some other way. I gave the money to that evil woman and I felt very bad after I had done this, because I had never stretched my hand towards any haraam things before. I am very religiously committed and I am memorizing the Qur&rsquo;aan. After some time, this evil woman asked me for some more money. In the midst of my pain and suffering, my theft from my aunt&rsquo;s house was discovered and my mother was shocked. As soon as she asked me I burst into tears and told her about the whole problem. Praise be to Allaah, my mother is a wise woman and trusts me completely, and she understood the situation, and she regards what happened to me and to her as a test from Allaah, but she criticized me sharply for not turning to her and for committing the sin of stealing. She asked me to pray to Allaah for forgiveness and I calmed down, and she thought that this was the end of the matter.  My mother explained to my aunt what had happened, and returned to her what I had taken from her, but unfortunately my aunt did not believe it. Now the matter has had other consequences that affect my honour and reputation, and when I am with my family and relatives I am one person and when I am away from them I am someone else. When I swore on the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan in my aunt&rsquo;s presence that I was innocent, chaste and righteous, my aunt insisted that what had happened to me was no justification for stealing from her house and that she has lost trust in all young women after what I had done. What made matters worse is that I have a cousin (daughter of my maternal aunt) who always used to say to me: &ldquo;Have you ever loved someone?&rdquo; or whatever, and I would respond by saying that I would never go against sharee&rsquo;ah or religion. When my cousin saw my situation she started to incite her mother against me even more, and there was an argument between my mother who was defending my honour, and my aunt who was accusing me of taking drugs, or that the picture was genuine and was not a fake, and love and affection turned to hatred and resentment.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur shaykh: I am turning to you to judge between us, for I am a victim who has been accused falsely. I admit that I made a mistake because I committed a sin to get out of this crisis. I admit that I made a mistake because I was not frank with my mother from the beginning, because I was so afraid for her and I thought that I could finish with this matter without her knowing.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope that you can judge between us and my aunt so that the love between us may be restored, if only partially, and the relationship may be restored between my mother and my aunt, whom our relatives thought would only ever be parted by death, especially since I am going to give my aunt your answer to read.",

When we read your \r\n    letter, we thought that it would end with your consulting them about what to \r\n    do with this treacherous friend, and we were shocked by the way things \r\n    developed and reached such an extent. Perhaps this is a lesson for everyone \r\n    who finds themselves in such a dilemma to look for a solution with others \r\n    before it gets even worse, because the more problems develop, the more \r\n    complicated they get, specially problems that befall women with regard to \r\n    evil and corrupt people. </span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>What you did with regard to \r\n    your aunt was absolutely necessary. You told her the truth, restored her \r\n    rights and swore to her what the truth of the matter really was. She has to \r\n    believe you and overlook this matter. Remember that being truthful will save \r\n    a person, and Allaah will cause the truth to be known sooner or later. So be \r\n    patient and seek the help of Allaah, and persist in making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, asking \r\n    Allaah to grant you relief and cause justice and truth to prevail.&nbsp; \r\n    </span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>We offer you this advice, which \r\n    you need to discuss with your family and with a lawyer &ndash; if possible &ndash; \r\n    because we do not know anything about the laws in your country: why don&rsquo;t \r\n    you tell the police about your friend who betrayed you with this picture, \r\n    because we think that if she is arrested and her computer is inspected, \r\n    Allaah will suffice you against her evil and the truth will come out in sha \r\n    Allaah.</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The second message is addressed to your friend:</u>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>You have to repent to Allaah \r\n    and seek His forgiveness for what you have done, and you should realize that \r\n    you have committed many sins and caused many bad things to happen. You have \r\n    betrayed your friend and made false accusations against her, you have helped \r\n    to spread evil by means of bad pictures which you have spread after adding \r\n    the picture of your friend to them, you have taken money from her \r\n    unlawfully, and you have caused trouble for her and caused her to break \r\n    family ties.</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>Part of repentance is admitting \r\n    your error to your friend, her mother and her aunt. Allaah will not accept \r\n    your repentance otherwise, because one of the conditions of repentance is \r\n    setting right things that were affected by the sin. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Except those who repent and do righteous deeds, and \r\n    openly declare (the truth which they concealed).

Man&rsquo;s life is short, then he will meet his \r\n    Lord with his deeds, so beware of meeting your Lord with those deeds without \r\n    having repented sincerely from them. </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>Another part of repenting \r\n    properly is returning the wealth that you took unlawfully from your friend.</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>Another part of repenting \r\n    properly is destroying the picture completely, and not committing this sin \r\n    again either with your friend or with someone else.</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>The third message is addressed to your aunt:</u>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>You should understand that \r\n    Allaah is always watching you, He hears what you say and He knows that which \r\n    is hidden and that which is more secret.

It is to a woman like you that people would refer with regard to \r\n    problems, and it is to people like you that those who are astray look for \r\n    guidance. Your daughter and the daughters of your sisters turn to your for \r\n    help, because you are the source of compassion and the merciful heart that \r\n    they know, and our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;The maternal aunt is like the mother.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (2553).</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>We will ask you a single \r\n    question which we hope you will answer to yourself: What if something this &ndash; \r\n    Allaah forbid &ndash; had happened to one of your daughters? What if she had done \r\n    what your sister&rsquo;s daughter did? Would you like her aunt&rsquo;s attitude towards \r\n    her to be like your attitude now? We are sure &ndash; based on our good opinion of \r\n    you &ndash; that you would never want that. So why do you agree to that for \r\n    yourself? Do not think it is unlikely that bad would do things like that, \r\n    and do not think it is unlikely that good people may be falsely accused of \r\n    bad things. </span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We wish you and your sons and daughters well, and we hope \r\n    that you will have an open mind and accept the truth and realize that your \r\n    niece is innocent of the false accusation that her friend made against her. \r\n    We have advised her friend to repent and admit the truth to you. May Allaah \r\n    guide her to admit to you the awful thing she has done. But we also ask you \r\n    to think about this false accusation and understand that it is pure \r\n    fabrication, and your wisdom and compassion dictate that you should do the \r\n    right thing in this case.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>Your Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has enjoined something upon you \r\n    and we do not think that you will do anything but respond to it. This \r\n    command is that if someone swears to you by Allaah, you must believe him and \r\n    accept his oath. You have no certain knowledge that contradicts your niece&rsquo;s \r\n    oath, so you have no choice but to obey the command of your Prophet Muhammad \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever swears by Allaah, let him fulfil his oath, and if an oath is \r\n    sworn for a person by Allaah, let him accept it. Whoever is not content with \r\n    Allaah has nothing to do with Allaah.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2101); \r\n    classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (11/536) and by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb</i> (2951).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Sindi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on\r\n    <i>Sunan Ibn Maajah</i>: &ldquo;if an oath is sworn for a person by Allaah&rdquo; means: \r\n    an oath is sworn for him by Allaah to please him. &ldquo;Has nothing to do with \r\n    Allaah&rdquo; means, will never be close to Him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that that who are close to Allaah believe the \r\n    one who swears an oath, out of veneration towards Allaah. The one who does \r\n    not believe him when he is able to do so is not one of them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the words &ldquo;and if an oath is sworn for a \r\n    person by Allaah, let him accept it. Whoever is not content with Allaah has \r\n    nothing to do with Allaah&rdquo;, if there is no way to settle the matter except \r\n    by asking his opponent to swear an oath and he swears an oath, then \r\n    undoubtedly he must accept it. But if what is happening between the people\r\n    <u>is something on a personal level, where people are trying to justify \r\n    their positions with other and the like</u>, then it is the right of one \r\n    Muslim over another that <u>he should accept what he says when he swears an \r\n    oath absolving himself of blame or declaring his innocence of what he has \r\n    been accused of or justifying his position</u>. Another right that he has \r\n    over him is that he should think well of him if there is no evidence to the \r\n    contrary, as in the report narrated from &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him): &ldquo;Do not think badly of a word that is uttered by a Muslim when there \r\n    is a way of interpreting it positively.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The hadeeth also points to humility, compassion, love and \r\n    other interests that Allaah loves, as is clear to anyone who has any \r\n    understanding. This is a means of uniting hearts in obedience to Allaah, and \r\n    it also comes under the heading of the good attitude which is the heaviest \r\n    thing that may be placed in a person&rsquo;s balance, as it says in the hadeeth, \r\n    and it is one of the noblest of characteristics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Majeed</i> (p. 405).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We hope that you will think about the words of this Shaykh \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him), for they are relevant to your situation. One \r\n    of your niece&rsquo;s rights over you is that you should accept her oath, and one \r\n    of her rights over you is that you should think well of her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Do you know what &lsquo;Eesa (peace be upon him) did when he saw a \r\n    man stealing, and that man swore to him by Allaah that he did not steal? \r\n    Think about it:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Eesa ibn Maryam saw a man stealing and &lsquo;Eesa said to him: \r\n    &lsquo;Did you steal?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;No, by the One besides Whom there is no other \r\n    god.&rsquo; &lsquo;Eesa said: &lsquo;I believe in Allaah and I disbelieve my own eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3260) and Muslim (2368).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The \r\n    Messiah (peace be upon him), because of the great fear of Allaah in his \r\n    heart, thought that this person who swore by the Oneness of Allaah was \r\n    telling the truth, so his belief in Allaah made him believe him and make him \r\n    think that his eyes had deceived him, and shown him something that he did \r\n    not see, so he said: &ldquo;I believe in Allaah and I disbelieve my own eyes.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly one&rsquo;s eyes may be mistaken and see things other \r\n    than they really are, and may imagine things that do not really exist, then \r\n    reason dictates that this is a mistake. The Messiah <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) put his faith before his vision, and \r\n    disbelieved what his eyes had seen, and attributed the mistake to himself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Badaa&rsquo;i&rsquo; al-Fawaa&rsquo;id</i> (3/1159, \r\n    1160).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We hope that what we have mentioned will be sufficient to \r\n    persuade you to accept your niece&rsquo;s oath and lift the accusation from her. \r\n    You cannot afford to go against Islamic teachings by rejecting this ruling, \r\n    We think that you are of a noble character, in sha Allaah. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>We end this message to you by \r\n    saying that if, Allaah forbid, your niece has committed any sin or error &ndash; \r\n    and we would never say that you know that from a third party but we will say \r\n    that you saw it yourself &ndash; then do you know what you should do?

But nevertheless <i>Qoot al-Quloob</i> includes da&rsquo;eef (weak) \r\n    and mawdoo&rsquo; (fabricated) ahaadeeth, and many unacceptable things. With \r\n    regard to what is said in <i>al-Ihya&rsquo;</i> about things that may doom a \r\n    person to Hell, such as pride, self-admiration, showing off, malicious envy, \r\n    etc., most of it is taken from al-Haarith al-Muhaasibi in <i>al-Ri&rsquo;aayah</i>; \r\n    some of it is acceptable and some of it is to be rejected, and some of it is \r\n    controversial. There is a great deal of good in <i>al-Ihya&rsquo;</i> but it also \r\n    contains some blameworthy material and some corrupt material such as the \r\n    words of the philosophers on Tawheed, Prophethood and the Resurrection. When \r\n    he deals with Sufi topics it is like one who has taken an enemy of the \r\n    Muslims and dressed him in Muslim garb. The leaders of Islam denounced Abu \r\n    Haamid for this feature of his books, and they said that he was made sick by\r\n    <i>al-Shifa&rsquo;</i>, meaning <i>Shifa&rsquo; Ibn Seena</i>, which is about \r\n    philosophy. [<i>Shifa&rsquo;</i> literally means &ldquo;healing&rdquo; in Arabic].&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Ihya&rsquo;</i> contains da&rsquo;eef (weak) \r\n    ahaadeeth and reports, and even many mawdoo&rsquo; (fabricated) reports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It contains many of the errors and myths of the Sufis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Nevertheless it also contains some of the words of Sufi \r\n    shaykhs who correctly understand the actions of the heart in accordance with \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and it speaks of acts of worship and etiquette in \r\n    accordance with the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah; such material outweighs the material \r\n    that is to be rejected. This is why people differed and disputed concerning \r\n    it.&rdquo; (<i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa</i>, vol 10, p. 551).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence our advice is that people should not read it, \r\n    especially since there other books in the same field which mean that there \r\n    is no need for it, such as <i>Haadi al-Arwaah</i>, <i>al-Fawaa&rsquo;id</i>, <i>\r\n    Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad</i> by Ibn al-Qayyim; <i>al-&lsquo;Uboodiyyah</i> and <i>al-Eemaan</i> \r\n    by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah; <i>Lataa&rsquo;if al-Ma&rsquo;aarif</i>, and <i>\r\n    Risaalat al-Khushoo&rsquo; fi&rsquo;l-Salaah</i>, by Ibn Rajab. There is also a summary \r\n    of <i>Ihya&rsquo; &lsquo;Uloom al-Deen</i> from which one may benefit, such as <i>\r\n    Mukhtasar Manhaaj al-Qaasideen</i> by Ibn Qudaamah. In the case of a student \r\n    (<i>taalib al-&lsquo;ilm</i>) who has a strong foundation of knowledge, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with him reading it if he is able to distinguish between what \r\n    is saheeh (sound) and what is da&rsquo;eef (weak), what is true and what is false.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;For more information on al-Ghazzaali and his book, please \r\n    see Question no. <span>13473</span>.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;And Allaah knows best.<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"

Hence Allaah mentions His rights and parents&rsquo; rights together in many verses of \r\n    the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan, such as when He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your \r\n    parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in \r\n    terms of honour.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>[al-Isra&rsquo; 17:23]&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Obeying parents is obligatory unless they enjoin sin, in which case they should \r\n    not be obeyed. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no obedience to any created being if it involves \r\n    disobedience towards the Creator.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4340; Muslim, 1840; Ahmad, 1098. Isbaal or letting the lower garment hang below the \r\n    ankles is a major sin, so you should not obey them if they tell you to do that. But you can wear your clothes at the longest permissible length so \r\n    that they do not touch the ankles, then you will not be disobeying your Lord by doing that, and you will not be going against your parents&rsquo; \r\n    wishes, because it is not a condition of shortening the lower garment that it should be at mid-calf length, rather you can obey the rule of \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah by not letting your clothes touch your ankles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If they insist that your clothes should be longer than ankle length, then speak to \r\n    them nicely and try to convince them, but do not disobey Allaah for their sake by letting your clothes hang below the ankles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez Aal al-Shaykh was asked:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What is the ruling on isbaal (letting the clothes hang below the ankles)? Is it \r\n    permissible to obey my father when he wants me to let my clothes hang below the ankles?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Isbaal is haraam, indeed it is one of the major sins. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever allows his garment to trail along the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day \r\n    of Resurrection.&rdquo; And he mentioned the three whom Allaah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection or praise them, and theirs will be a painful \r\n    torment, among whom is the one who allows his garment to hang below his ankles. The one who does this is disobeying Allaah and transgressing His \r\n    sacred limits, so he has to repent to Allaah. He will be punished because Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be \r\n    punished because he is given a warning of Hell fire, which indicates that isbaal is one of the major sins, Moreover there is nothing good in \r\n    isbaal, because it damages the clothes and may make the person stumble, as &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to the young man whom he \r\n    saw allowing his garment to hang below his ankles &ndash; who came to visit &lsquo;Umar in his final sickness &ndash; &ldquo;O young man, lift up your lower garment for \r\n    it will make your garment last longer and is more obedient to your Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to obeying your parents, parents are not to be obeyed if that involves \r\n    disobeying Allaah. If they tell you to let your garment hang below your ankles, then you should disobey them, because isbaal is a major sin and \r\n    there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawah Majallat al-Da&rsquo;wah</i>, issue no. 1741&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

It also includes Farqad al-Subkhi who is da&rsquo;eef al-hadeeth and makes \r\n    a lot of mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To conclude: the isnaads of this hadeeth are all very weak \r\n    (da&rsquo;eef), and are not supported by the fact that there are many of them. So \r\n    it is not permissible to attribute the hadeeth to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The hadeeth was classed as da&rsquo;eef in \r\n    all its isnaads by Shaykh al-Albaani in <i>al-Silsilah al-Saheehah</i> (no. \r\n    309-312).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But there is no need for it because there is a great deal of \r\n    evidence in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah which calls on Muslims to love one \r\n    another and show compassion towards one another, and states that brothers in \r\n    faith must take care of one another. For example, Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic \r\n    religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allaah, \r\n    that you may receive mercy&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hujuraat 49:10]</i>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;&ldquo;The likeness of the believers in their mutual love, mercy and \r\n    compassion is that of the body; when one part of it is in pain, the rest of \r\n    the body joins it in restlessness and fever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6011) and Muslim (2586).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.</p><br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

Our advice to you is to \r\n    check yourself and realize that when Allaah becomes angry with His slave He \r\n    dooms him and removes blessing from his entire life, if he does not repent \r\n    and turn back to his Lord.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to telling your husband about what has happened to you in the past, you do \r\n    not have to do that once you have repented from it. You should cover \r\n    yourself and not speak openly of something that you have done in the past. \r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;All of \r\n    my ummah will be forgiven except those who commit sin blatantly. It is \r\n    committing sin blatantly if a man does something at night, then in the \r\n    morning when Allaah has concealed him, he says, &lsquo;O So and so, I did such and \r\n    such last night,&rsquo; when all night his Lord has concealed him, and he uncovers \r\n    that which Allaah has concealed.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6069; Muslim, \r\n    2990.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Your \r\n    parents&rsquo; marriage is not regarded as null and void, because there is not \r\n    connection between what happened and your parents&rsquo; marriage. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And no \r\n    bearer of burdens shall bear another&rsquo;s burden&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n    <p><i>[Faatir \r\n    35:18]</i>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>So if you \r\n    conceal what you did, and your brother also conceals what he did &ndash; which is \r\n    what you both must do &ndash; then the relationship between your children will be \r\n    very normal and there will be no problems, either from the shar&rsquo;i or social \r\n    point of view.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to repentance from sin and seeking forgiveness for it, there are conditions \r\n    attached, which are discussed in question no.\r\n    [fatin]13990[\\fatin].&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>May Allaah \r\n    help you to do all that is good.<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

But Imam Maalik said: Taking back is achieved \r\n    by touching with desire if the intention is to take the wife back. So long \r\n    as your husband says that he that he did not intend to take you back, then \r\n    he did not take you back by doing that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mughni</i>, 7/404; <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah</i>, \r\n    13/187.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the &lsquo;iddah of a woman divorced by a revocable \r\n    talaaq, it is three menstrual cycles for women who menstruate, so there are \r\n    two cycles left for you as your husband said, then your &lsquo;iddah will be over. \r\n    If he took you back during this time then this divorce is counted as one of \r\n    the three talaaqs, and he has to bring people to witness that he is taking \r\n    you back. So he has one talaaq left, and if he does not take you back during \r\n    the &lsquo;iddah period then you are divorced from him, and it is not permissible \r\n    for him to go back to you except with a new marriage contract and a new \r\n    &lsquo;iddah, and the marriage cannot be completed except with your consent and \r\n    the agreement of your wali (guardian).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.</p><br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

If he stays with his \r\n    mother&rsquo;s husband, should he adopt him and regard him as one of his own \r\n    children with regard to all rights, or will he just be under his care only? \r\n    But if he is attributed to the adulterer, should he regard him as one of his \r\n    real children or keep him with him even though he is still illegitimate? &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>They replied: If a married \r\n    woman commits zina and becomes pregnant, then the child belongs to the \r\n    (owner of the) bed (i.e. the husband), because of the saheeh hadeeth. If the \r\n    owner of the bed wants to deny the child by engaging in li&rsquo;aan then he may \r\n    do that before the shar&rsquo;i judge, and in that case the child does not belong \r\n    to anyone according to the consensus of the Muslims. But adoption is not \r\n    permissible and the adopted child does not truly become the child of the one \r\n    who adopted him.

      "question_full": "I married a girl two years ago, and I agreed to it because she is religiously committed and she had memorized the Qur&rsquo;aan in a short time. But when I saw her on the night of the engagement, I was put off because she is not beautiful. But I forced myself to accept her because of her religious commitment and other good qualities. We got married, but then I found out that she is bad-tempered and moody, which has affected our relationship and has made me keep away from her even more. It has reached a stage  where I think that I do not love her, and I have started to shun her in bed, and she has been harmed by that a great deal, but she loves me, and I am afraid that if I divorce her, she will be greatly affected by that. I deeply regret having married her, and I am very upset, but I cannot stand her and I do not want her to waste her life with someone who does not love her, and I feel confused. I am very worried that my Lord may punish me for having married her even though I did not like her. I heard a lecture from a Shaykh who said: Marry her for her religious commitment even if she is not beautiful. What is the solution? May Allaah bless you.",

So if someone has a wife whose looks are not pleasing to \r\n    him, we say to him: Be content that she is a woman of good character, and \r\n    make this quality a reason for keeping her and being patient with her, for \r\n    that is what is best for your honour and your wealth and is best for your \r\n    children&rsquo;s upbringing.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(ii)</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Allaah has \r\n    decreed that there is a lot of good in this world and in the Hereafter, in \r\n    his being patient and putting up with her. In this world he may have a \r\n    righteous child from her, and in the Hereafter he may be greatly rewarded \r\n    for his patience. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;and live \r\n    with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a \r\n    thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Nisa&rsquo; \r\n    4:19]</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Imam al-Tabari \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;<i>and live \r\n    with them honourably.

Similarly it \r\n    is not permissible for the wife to try to prove she is better than the \r\n    husband. Rather both of them must treat the other kindly. It is well known \r\n    that the husband may dislike the wife, either because she falls short in her \r\n    duties towards him or because of some lack of intelligence and wisdom, and \r\n    so on. How should he deal with this woman? We say: This is mentioned in the \r\n    Qur'aan and in the Sunnah. Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;If you \r\n    dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through \r\n    it a great deal of good&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Nisa&rsquo; \r\n    4:19]</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And this \r\n    happens in fact. A man may dislike his wife for some reason, but he shows \r\n    patience, and Allaah creates a lot of good in this, and the dislike turns to \r\n    love, the lack of interest to delight, and so on .&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No believing \r\n    man should hate a believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics \r\n    he will be pleased with another.&rdquo; Look at this balanced view.&nbsp; Allaah gave \r\n    great wisdom to the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him): &ldquo;If he dislikes one of her characteristics he will be pleased with \r\n    another.&rdquo; Does anyone get everything he wants in this world? No, not at all. \r\n    You will never get everything you want in this world, and even if one thing \r\n    is perfect, something else will be lacking, even days. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;And so are \r\n    the days (good and not so good), that We give to men by turns&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[Aal \r\n    &lsquo;Imraan 3:140]</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Concerning \r\n    that the Jaahili poet said:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>A day against \r\n    us and a day for us, a day when we are sad and a day when we are happy.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Try this and \r\n    you will find that it is true. The world does not stay the same. A well \r\n    known saying is: It is impossible for things to stay the same. So if you \r\n    dislike something about your wife, think instead of what you are pleased \r\n    with, until you are convinced.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Liqaa&rsquo;aat \r\n    al-Baab il-Maftooh</span></i><span> \r\n    (introduction to part 159)&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>2 &ndash; You should \r\n    note that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \r\n    us that beauty is one of the things for which a woman may be married, but he \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us of that which is \r\n    better, which is a wife who is religiously-committed.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It was \r\n    narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their \r\n    beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is \r\n    religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you \r\n    prosper).&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (4802) and Muslim (1466).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Badr al-Deen \r\n    al-&lsquo;Ayni (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He mentioned \r\n    &ldquo;their religious commitment&rdquo; because through that one may attain goodness in \r\n    this world and in the Hereafter. What is befitting for those who are \r\n    religiously committed and of noble character is that religion should be \r\n    their focus in all things, especially in long-term matters. Hence the \r\n    Messenger chose that which is best in the long-term and emphasized its \r\n    importance, so he said choose the one who is religiously-committed, because \r\n    through her you will attain the benefits of both realms (this world and the \r\n    Hereafter) and your hands will be rubbed with dust if you do not do what you \r\n    have been enjoined to do. Al-Karmaani said:&nbsp; Choose (the one who is \r\n    religiously-committed), if you understand, O you who are seeking guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>They differed \r\n    concerning the meaning of the words &ldquo;may your hands be rubbed with dust.&rdquo; It \r\n    was said that it is basically a du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; but the Arabs use it to express \r\n    objection, wonder, veneration and encouragement, and this is what is meant \r\n    here. It is encouragement to seek the company of religiously-committed \r\n    people in all things, because the one who keeps company with them will \r\n    benefit from their attitudes and will be safe from evil on their part.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&lsquo;Umdat \r\n    al-Qaari&rsquo; Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari</span></i><span> \r\n    (20/86)&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>3 &ndash; You should \r\n    note that true beauty is inward, and the worldly beauty in outward form is \r\n    bound to fade, either through sickness or burns, or with age. So the wise \r\n    man looks for beauty that will not fade, but will increase and not decrease. \r\n    The effect of this beauty is seen in a woman&rsquo;s attitude and good treatment \r\n    of her husband, and the good way in which she raises her children.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>4 &ndash; You should \r\n    note that Allaah calls that which exists between husband and wife \r\n    &ldquo;affection&rdquo; and &ldquo;mercy&rdquo;; He does not call it &ldquo;love&rdquo;. He says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;And among \r\n    His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that \r\n    you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. \r\n    Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Room \r\n    30:21]</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This is \r\n    usually how it is among wise and noble people. The one who wants to get \r\n    married hears of a woman who is fit for marriage and he comes to propose to \r\n    her and is impressed by her beauty or religious commitment or modesty, so he \r\n    marries her. We do not say in this case that he has married for love, and \r\n    Allaah does not call that which He creates between them love. This is not to \r\n    reject the word or deny that love exists, rather it is to point out \r\n    something of the greatest importance, which is that marriage is prescribed \r\n    for many purposes, such as keeping oneself chaste, building a Muslim family \r\n    and having children. Hence it was narrated from &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) that a man came to him wanting to divorce his \r\n    wife, and when &lsquo;Umar asked him about the reason for that, he said that he \r\n    did not love her. &lsquo;Umar replied: Are families not built on anything but \r\n    love.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&lsquo;Umar also \r\n    asked a woman whether she felt hatred towards her husband? She said: Yes. \r\n    &lsquo;Umar said to her: One of you should lie (about their feelings) and be \r\n    patient. Not every family is built on love, but on good treatment on the \r\n    basis of lineage and \r\n    Islam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>So think about \r\n    this, and look at the problems experienced by those who marry beautiful \r\n    women who are not religiously-committed, and see how their lives are, full \r\n    of despair, misery, doubts and suspicion. Look at the happiness and harmony \r\n    experienced by those who marry religiously-committed women and how their \r\n    lives are and how their children grow up.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>5 &ndash; You could \r\n    take a second wife, and keep this wife too. You have two choices:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(i)</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Give her her \r\n    rights in full, and give her the same share as the second wife, which is \r\n    treating her kindly as is enjoined upon you, and as we have mentioned at the \r\n    beginning of the answer, and as it is well known that it is haraam to \r\n    mistreat others in general, and especially in the case of co-wives.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(ii)</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>You could come \r\n    to some agreement whereby your wife gives up some of her rights to a share \r\n    of your time, but you keep her as a wife and look after her and see her; you \r\n    can enter upon her and stay with her, and she will raise your child for you, \r\n    and preserve your honour and your wealth. After some time your feelings \r\n    towards her may change, and you may give her a share of your time as you \r\n    give to your second wife. This solution is mentioned in the Book of Allaah, \r\n    in the Sunnah of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) and in the words of the scholars.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It was \r\n    narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) (concerning the \r\n    verse) <i>&ldquo;And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband&rsquo;s part, \r\n    there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; \r\n    and making peace is better.

She said: There is nothing \r\n    wrong with that if they both agree.

This is in \r\n    accordance with the Sunnah and it is the correct way and there is no \r\n    justification for anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Zaad \r\n    al-Ma&rsquo;aad</span></i><span> \r\n    (5/152).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>5 &ndash; If you \r\n    cannot be patient in keeping her and treating her kindly, and you cannot \r\n    take a second wife, or she refuses to reconcile, then you have nothing but \r\n    the final option, which is to divorce her and part from her in a kind \r\n    manner, and give her her rights in full, and perhaps Allaah will choose \r\n    someone better for you than her, and will choose someone better than you for \r\n    her.

But if he comes during the tashahhud or sujood, nobody should move forward or\r\n    move back until they stand up again. There is no dispute that this moving forward or back\r\n    should not occur until after the second person has said the takbeer for starting the\r\n    prayer, as they mentioned. And Allaah knows best.&rdquo;<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"

Hence we say:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is proven in the saheeh Sunnah that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not inveigh against \r\n    time, for Allaah is Time.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is wrongly understood by some people, who think that \r\n    al-dahr (translated as &ldquo;time&rdquo;) is one of the names of Allaah. But that is \r\n    not the case. Rather al-dahr means [the vicissitudes of] time. The people of \r\n    the Jaahiliyyah &ndash; who still have followers in this matter &ndash; used to inveigh \r\n    against time, but none of them intended to inveigh against Allaah. How can \r\n    they have intended to inveigh against Allaah when they used to say &lsquo;Qabbah \r\n    Allaah al-dahr (May Allaah curse time)&rsquo;? Rather inveighing against time was \r\n    forbidden, and time was ascribed to Allaah, because He, may He be exalted, \r\n    is its Creator and controller.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more detailed discussion of this matter, please see:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>The answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]26977[\\fatin], in which it states that al-dahr is not one of the names of Allaah.</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    </span><span>The answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]9571[\\fatin], in which it states the meaning of the saheeh hadeeth, &ldquo;Do not inveigh \r\n    against time, for Allaah is time.&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked about the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him), &ldquo;Do not inveigh against time, for Allaah is time.&rdquo; Does this \r\n    support what the Ittihaadis [pantheists] say? Please explain that to us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Praise be to Allaah. The hadeeth &ldquo;Do not inveigh against \r\n    time, for Allaah is time&rdquo; was narrated in other wordings, such as &ldquo;Allaah \r\n    says: &lsquo;<span>The son of Adam inveighs against Me, he \r\n    inveighs against [the vicissitudes of] Time (al-Dahr), and I am Time, in My \r\n    hand are all affairs, I alternate the night and the day&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span>Do \r\n    not inveigh against time (al-dahr), for Allaah is time, He alternates the \r\n    night and day&rdquo; and &ldquo;The son of Adam says, &lsquo;Woe to time,&rsquo; but I am time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The words &ldquo;in My hand are all \r\n    affairs, I alternate the night and the day&rdquo; indicate that the meaning is not \r\n    &ldquo;I am time [zamaan]&rdquo;, because Allaah states that He alternates night and \r\n    day, and time [zamaan] is night and day. Thus this hadeeth indicates that He \r\n    alternates and controls time, as is indicated in the verse in which He says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;</span>See \r\n    you not that Allaah drives the clouds gently, then joins them together, then \r\n    makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain comes forth from \r\n    between them; and He sends down from the sky hail (like) mountains, (or \r\n    there are in the heaven mountains of hail from where He sends down hail), \r\n    and strikes therewith whom He wills, and averts it from whom He wills. The \r\n    vivid flash of its (clouds) lightning nearly blinds the sight<span>&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Noor 24:43]</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Allaah states that He creates the \r\n    rain and sends it down to the earth; it is the cause of life on earth \r\n    because He has created from water every living thing. Then He says \r\n    <i>&ldquo;</i></span><i>Allaah causes the \r\n    night and the day to succeed each other<span>&rdquo;</span></i><span> \r\n    [v. 44].&nbsp; So He alternates the night and day, and causes the state of the \r\n    earth to change by sending down rain, which is the cause of the creation of \r\n    plants, animals and minerals. This is what causes people&rsquo;s situations to \r\n    change, which leads to some people being raised in status whilst others are \r\n    lowered.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Allaah tells us in more than one \r\n    place that He has created time, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \r\n    &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;</span>and \r\n    originated the darkness and the light<span>&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:1]&nbsp;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;</span>And \r\n    He it is Who has created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, \r\n    each in an orbit floating<span>&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:33]&nbsp;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;</span><span>And \r\n    He it is Who has put the night and the day in succession, for such who \r\n    desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude</span><span>&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Furqaan 25:62]&nbsp;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;</span>Verily, \r\n    in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of \r\n    night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding<span>&rdquo;</span></i></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:190]</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And there are other texts which \r\n    state that He is the Creator of time. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>There is no confusion in this \r\n    hadeeth, even if He did not state that He alternates the night and the day, \r\n    so how about when it says in the same hadeeth that in His hand are all \r\n    affairs, He alternates the night and the day?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The Muslims are unanimously agreed \r\n    on something that is based on common sense and rational thinking:&nbsp; that \r\n    Allaah is not al-dahr in the sense of al-zamaan. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa</span></i><span> \r\n    (2/491-494).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Abu &lsquo;Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Salaam \r\n    al-Harawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The phrase &ldquo;Allaah is time \r\n    (al-dahr)&rdquo; &ndash; no Muslim should be confused about its meaning, because those \r\n    who deny the attributes of Allaah use this hadeeth against the Muslims. I \r\n    have seen one of those who are accused of heresy and who do not believe in \r\n    the hereafter quoting this hadeeth and saying: Do you not see that he says \r\n    &lsquo;Allaah is time&rsquo;? I say: Is there anyone who would inveigh against Allaah in \r\n    any era? Rather its meaning in my opinion &ndash; and Allaah knows best &ndash; is that \r\n    the Arabs (before Islam) used to blame time and inveigh against it when \r\n    calamity such as death, old age, loss of wealth or other things befell them, \r\n    so they regarded time as that which did that, so they inveighed against it \r\n    because of that, and mentioned it in their poetry.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Ghareeb al-hadeeth</span></i><span> \r\n    (2/145).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Secondly:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>When it becomes clear to you that \r\n    al-dahr is not one of the names of Allaah, you will understand that there is \r\n    nothing confusing about the phrase mentioned in the question, which is &ldquo;Let \r\n    us put our hand in the hand of time.&rdquo; Because it does not imply any meaning \r\n    that is contrary to sharee&rsquo;ah, rather it is just a rhetorical style.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It may be criticized from another \r\n    point of view, however. We have seen some people who use this phrase with \r\n    the word &ldquo;zamaan&rdquo; and unfortunately many of them use expressions that \r\n    inveigh against time, and they add more ideas to that, such as the notion \r\n    that time is an oppressor, and some of them apply this wording to Allaah, \r\n    may He be exalted, and some of them mean thereby al-qadar (divine decree). \r\n    So the ways in which people use this phrase vary, but we have not seen this \r\n    phrase in the words of scholars and imams. The ruling thereon depends on how \r\n    it is used in the sentence and what the speaker believes with regard to it.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The meaning of the words mentioned \r\n    in the question may be that a person is going through life with changes in \r\n    reality and time, and he is not going against it. This understanding \r\n    includes both that which is true and that which is false. We cannot judge \r\n    the sentence fully unless we know its context and the intention of the \r\n    speaker.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And Allaah knows best</span>.<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

The following is a summary of that, with additional comments from \r\n    some other scholars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The meaning of circumcision (<i>khitaan</i>):&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Khitaan</i> is a \r\n    noun describing the action of the circumciser (<i>khaatin</i>). It is also used to describe the site of the circumcision, as in the hadeeth, &ldquo;When \r\n    the two circumcised parts (<i>al-khitaanaan</i>) meet, ghusl become obligatory.&rdquo; In the case of a female the word used is <i>khafad</i>. In the \r\n    male it is also called i&rsquo;dhaar. The one who is uncircumcised is called <i>aghlaf</i> or <i>aqlaf</i>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tuhfat al-Mawlood</i>, \r\n    1/152&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Circumcision is the Sunnah of Ibraaheem \r\n    and the Prophets after him:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari (6298) and Muslim (2370) narrated \r\n    that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Ibraaheem \r\n    (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old, and he circumcised himself with an adze.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>An adze (<i>qadoom</i>) is a carpenter&rsquo;s \r\n    tool; it was also said that al-Qadoom is a place is Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is most likely that what is referred to in \r\n    the hadeeth is the tool. Abu Ya&rsquo;laa narrated that &lsquo;Ali ibn Rabaah said: &ldquo;Ibraaheem was commanded to circumcise himself, so he circumcised himself \r\n    with an adze and it was very painful for him. Then Allaah revealed to him saying, &ldquo;You rushed to do it before We told you what tool to use.&rdquo; He \r\n    said, &ldquo;O Lord, I did not want to delay obeying Your command.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Circumcision was one of the things with which \r\n    Allaah tested Ibraaheem, His Close Friend. He did them perfectly so Allaah made him a leader of mankind. It was narrated that he was the first one \r\n    who was circumcised, as mentioned above. What it says in <i>al-Saheeh</i> is that Ibraaheem circumcised himself when he was eighty years old. \r\n    After him, circumcision continued among the Messengers and their followers, even the Messiah. He was circumcised and the Christians affirm that, \r\n    and do not deny that, as they also affirm that he was forbidden the flesh of pigs&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tuhfat al-Mawdood</i>, \r\n    p. 158-159&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    them) differed as to the ruling on circumcision.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The most correct view \r\n    is that it is obligatory in the case of men and Sunnah in the case of women. The difference between them is that in the case of men, it serves an \r\n    interest which has to do with one of the conditions of prayer, namely purity (tahaarah), because if the foreskin remains, when the urine comes out \r\n    of the urethra, some of it will collect there, and this causes burning and infection every time the person moves, and every time the foreskin is \r\n    squeezed, some drops of urine come out, thus causing najaasah (impurity).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the case of women, it serves a useful \r\n    purpose which is to reduce desire. This is seeking perfection, not removing something harmful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;</i>, \r\n    1/133-134&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him). Ibn Quddamah said in <i>al-Mughni</i> (1/115): As for circumcision, it is obligatory for men and it is good in the case of \r\n    woman, but it is not obligatory for them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Abu&rsquo;l-Barakaat said in his book al-Ghaayah: \r\n    In circumcision of a man, the skin at the tip of the penis (the foreskin) is removed; if he only removes most of it, that is permissible. It is \r\n    mustahabb to circumcise females provided that is not done in an extreme manner. It was narrated that &lsquo;Umar said to a woman who circumcised \r\n    females, &ldquo;Leave some of it if you circumcise (a girl).&rdquo; Al-Khallaal said in his <i>Jaami&rsquo;</i>: What is cut when circumcising: Muhammad ibn \r\n    al-Husayn told me that al-Fadl ibn Ziyaad told them: Ahmad was asked, How much should be cut in circumcision? He said, Until the glans (tip of the \r\n    penis) becomes visible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Sabbaagh said in <i>al-Shaamil</i>: \r\n    What is obligatory in the case of a man is to cut the skin on the tip of the penis until the entire glans becomes visible. In the case of a woman, \r\n    it means cutting the skin that looks like the comb of a rooster at the top of the vagina, between the two labia; if it is cut the base of it \r\n    should be left like a date pit. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The well-known correct view is that \r\n    everything covering the glans must be cut.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Majmoo&rsquo;</i>, \r\n    1/351&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Juwayni said: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The hadeeth indicates that not too much of it \r\n    should be removed (in the case of women), because he said, &ldquo;Leave something sticking out and do not go to extremes in cutting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tuhfat al-Mawdood</i>, \r\n    190-192&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The point is that in the case of males, all \r\n    the skin covering the tip of the penis should be cut, but in the case of females only a part of the skin that is like a rooster&rsquo;s comb at the top \r\n    of the vagina should be cut.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The wisdom behind circumcision&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to a man, he cannot be clean from \r\n    urine unless he is circumcised, because drops of urine collect underneath the foreskin and he cannot be sure that they will not drip and make his \r\n    clothes and body impure. Hence &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas was very strict on the issue of circumcision. Imam Ahmad said: Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas was very strict \r\n    on this matter, and it was narrated that there is no Hajj and no prayer for him, i.e., if a person is not circumcised his Hajj and prayer are not \r\n    valid. <i>Al-Mughni</i>, 1/115&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the \r\n    wisdom behind the circumcision of women, it is to regulate their desire so it will be moderate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked about whether women should be circumcised or not. He replied:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Praise be to Allaah. \r\n    Yes, they should be circumcised, i.e., the top of the piece of skin that looks like a rooster&rsquo;s comb should be cut. The Messenger of Allaah (S) \r\n    said to the woman who did circumcisions: &ldquo;Leave something sticking out and do not go to extremes in cutting. That makes her face look brighter and \r\n    is more pleasing to her husband.&rdquo; That is because the purpose of circumcising a man is to make him clean from the impurity that may collect \r\n    beneath the foreskin. But the purpose of circumcising women is to regulate their desire, because if a woman is not circumcised her desire will be \r\n    strong. Hence the words &ldquo;O son of an uncircumcised woman&rdquo; are used as an insult, because the uncircumcised woman has stronger desire. Hence \r\n    immoral actions are more common among the women of the Tatars and the Franks, that are not found among the Muslim women. If the circumcision is \r\n    too severe, the desire is weakened altogether, which is unpleasing for men; but if it is cut without going to extremes in that, the purpose will \r\n    be achieved, which is moderating desire. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa</i>, \r\n    21/114&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; It is permissible to pay money for \r\n    circumcision.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is permissible to \r\n    pay money for circumcision and for medical treatment. We do not know of any difference of opinion on this matter, because it is doing something \r\n    that is needed and which is allowed in sharee&rsquo;ah. So it is permissible to pay money for it, like all other permissible actions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Mughni</i>, 5/314.<br /><br />Source: Islam Q&A"

Then do that throughout the entire prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Both ahaadeeth indicate \r\n    that the one who is ignorant is excused, but in the hadeeth of Mu&rsquo;aawiyah he \r\n    is not commanded to repeat the prayer, whereas in the hadeeth of the one who \r\n    prayed badly, he is not commanded to repeat the prayers he had offered \r\n    before, rather he was commanded to repeat the current prayer only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadeeth of Mu&rsquo;aawiyah: As for the \r\n    words of the ignorant one, it was because he was new in Islam, so they are \r\n    like the words of one who forgets, so they did not invalidate his prayer if \r\n    they were few, because of this hadeeth of Mu&rsquo;aawiyah ibn al-Hakam, which we \r\n    are discussing here, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) did not command him to repeat the prayer. But he taught him \r\n    that it is haraam to talk during prayers for future reference. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>With regard to commanding \r\n    the one who prayed badly to repeat his prayer when he did not command \r\n    Mu&rsquo;aawiyah to do so, that is because there is a difference between doing \r\n    that which is forbidden and not doing that which is enjoined. Omitting what \r\n    is enjoined is not excused because of ignorance or forgetfulness when it is \r\n    possible to make it up, which is unlike doing what is forbidden.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said, in a discussion of things that are forbidden \r\n    whilst in ihraam: The correct view is that all of them may be excused. If a \r\n    person is excused due to ignorance, forgetting or being forced to do \r\n    something , there are no consequences to his actions whatsoever, whether it \r\n    has to do with having intercourse, hunting, clipping the nails, wearing \r\n    tailored garments or anything else. We have mentioned above evidence from \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;aan, Sunnah and rational thought. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>The same applies to all \r\n    other actions that are forbidden during acts of worship; the ruling does not \r\n    apply, if they happen in cases of ignorance forgetfulness or compulsion, \r\n    because of the general meaning of the texts and because the penalty, fidyah \r\n    or kafaarah (expiation) is only prescribed in order to compensate for going \r\n    against the rules or to expiate sins, but the ignorant, forgetful person or \r\n    one who is forced did not deliberately go against the rules, and if he had \r\n    remembered, been aware or had the choice he would not have done it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>If a person drinks by \r\n    mistake in Ramadaan (because he forgets he is fasting), he does not have to \r\n    make it up. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him): &ldquo;Whoever forgets when he is fasting and eats or \r\n    drinks, let him complete his fast, for it is Allaah Who has fed him and \r\n    given him to drink.&rdquo; The one who does not deliberately go against the rule \r\n    is not sinning and does not have to offer any fidyah.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Similarly, when &lsquo;Adiyy ibn \r\n    Haatim wanted to fast, he took a black thread and a white thread, because of \r\n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;and eat \r\n    and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct \r\n    from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) \r\n    till the nightfall&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:187]</i>. They used to take the rulings \r\n    directly from the Qur'aan. But the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said to him: &ldquo;Your pillow must be very wide, if the \r\n    black and white threads are beneath your pillow.&rdquo; But he did not command him \r\n    to repeat the fast because he was ignorant of the ruling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Similarly, Asma&rsquo; bint Abi \r\n    Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that they broke the fast on a \r\n    cloudy day at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him), and he did not command them to make it up &ndash; because \r\n    they were unaware of the fact that the sun had not yet set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>The same applies to prayer. \r\n    The evidence is that Mu&rsquo;aawiyah ibn al-Hakam (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) started to pray with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) and a man sneezed, so he said, &ldquo;<i>Yarhamuk-Allaah</i> (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on you)&rdquo; whilst he was praying. The people glared at him &ndash; i.e., \r\n    they looked at him disapprovingly &ndash; and he (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    said, &ldquo;May my mother be bereft of me!&rdquo;, i.e., he added more words to what he \r\n    had said. So they started to slap their thighs with their hands to make him \r\n    be quiet, and he fell silent. When he had said the salaam, the Messenger \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him. Mu&rsquo;aawiyah \r\n    said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for him; by Allaah I have never \r\n    seen a better teacher or better teachings before or since; he did not rebuke \r\n    me, hit me or revile me &ndash; he said: &ldquo;This prayer is not the right place for \r\n    any of the people&rsquo;s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, takbeer and recitation of \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan.&rdquo; And he did not tell him to repeat it because he was unaware of the \r\n    ruling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>The texts point to this \r\n    principle, which is not blaming people for forgetting, not knowing, or being \r\n    forced to do something. This is what is implied by the words of Allaah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;your Lord has written \r\n    (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in \r\n    ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying \r\n    Allaah), then surely, He is Oft&#8209;Forgiving, Most Merciful&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:54]</i>,&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>And the words of Allaah in \r\n    the hadeeth qudsi: &ldquo;My mercy prevails over My wrath.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Omitting to do that which \r\n    is enjoined, however, is not excused on the basis of forgetting, ignorance \r\n    or being forced, when it is possible to make it up, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever sleeps and misses \r\n    a prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers it.&rdquo; So it is not \r\n    waved in the case of forgetting. And because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not waive the current prayer on the \r\n    grounds of ignorance, as we see in the hadeeth of the one who prayed badly; \r\n    he commanded him to repeat it even though he was ignorant, because he was \r\n    omitting to do something enjoined. &nbsp;</p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, it is possible to \r\n    make up things that are enjoined, but forbidden things are over and done \r\n    with. But if a person is doing something that is forbidden, he should stop \r\n    doing it as soon as he realizes. If someone says that Allaah&rsquo;s words \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or \r\n    fall into error&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:286]</i> are general in meaning and include \r\n    both omitting things that are enjoined and doing things that are forbidden, \r\n    the response is that that is indeed the case; the one who does not do \r\n    something that is enjoined out of ignorance or because he forgets will not \r\n    be punished for not doing it, but not doing it means that he is obliged to \r\n    discharge his duty once the excuse is no longer applicable.
