      "title": "Is it permissible to put the sperm of the husband and the egg from the wife in the womb of the second wife?",
      "question": "<p>“Ahmad” has two wives, the first one cannot have children and the second one can have children, praise be to Allah. In the modern scientific age doctors can, by the grace of Allah, put an egg from the second wife with the husband’s sperm (test-tube baby) and mix them and let them start to grow, then place (the fertilized egg) in the womb of the wife who cannot have children, so that the child can grow until he is born. Is this permissible in the light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah? Some people say that it permissible by analogy with breastfeeding, i.e., just as it is permissible to nourish a child with her milk in her lap, it should also be permissible for her to nourish him with her blood in her womb.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This method of fertilization, which involves placing the egg with the husband’s sperm in the womb of the other wife, is a method that is not acceptable according to sharee’ah, and a large number of scholars are of the view that it is haraam. Statements were issued concerning it by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League. Those who initially said that this method was permissible later retracted their view. There follows some of what was said in those statements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The meeting of the Islamic Fiqh Council held on 8 – 13 Safar 1407 AH (11–16 October 1986).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After examining the subject of artificial fertilization –“test-tube babies” – by studying the research presented and listening to comments of experts and doctors, and after discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The methods of artificial fertilization that are known nowadays are seven:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in his wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>ii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm of a man other than the husband and the wife’s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>iii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, and the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to carry it (surrogate motherhood).</p>\n<p>iv.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of strangers, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>v.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.</p>\n<p>vi.Where sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, and fertilization occurs outside the womb, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>vii.Where sperm is taken from the husband and placed in the wife’s vagina or uterus so that fertilization may take place inside her body.</p>\n<p>It was determined that the first five methods are all haraam according to sharee’ah and are forbidden completely in and of themselves, or because of the results to which they will lead, such as mixing of lineages, loss of motherhood and other things that are forbidden according to sharee’ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the sixth and seventh methods, the committee thinks that there is nothing wrong with resorting to them in cases of need, after emphasizing that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majallat al-Majma’ (3/1/423).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 –Statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>and blessings and peace be upon our Master and Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session held at the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, from Saturday 18 Rabee’ al-Aakhir until Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985), examined the remarks submitted by some of its members concerning what the Council had declared permissible … with regard to artificial fertilization and test-tube babies, which was issued in its seventh session, held between 11-16 Rabee’ al-Aakhir 1404 AH, where it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the couple and, after fertilization in a laboratory vessel, the embryo is implanted in the womb of another wife of the same man, as she volunteers to carry this pregnancy of behalf of her co-wife whose womb has been removed – it seems to the committee that this is permissible in cases of need and subject to the general conditions mentioned previously.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The remarks may be summed up as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other wife in whose womb the embryo from the egg of the first wife is implanted may become pregnant with a second child before the embryo becomes established in her womb, as the result of relations with her husband around the time of the implanting of the embryo, then she may give birth to twins and it may not be known which child resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which resulted from relations with the husband, and it may not be known which wife is the mother of the child who resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which is the mother of the child who resulted from relations with the husband. Similarly, one of the two embryos may die at the ‘alaqah or mudghah stage but not be expelled from the uterus until the other child is born, and it may also not be known whether he is the child that resulted from the (implanted) embryo or from relations with the husband. This means that there is confusion as to who the real mother is and there is mixing of lineages which affects a number of rulings. All of this means that the Council must retract their rulings in the case mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Council has also listened to the opinions presented by doctors and obstetricians who attended the meeting and who pointed to the possibility of the other pregnancy being miscarried as the result of marital relations with the woman who is carrying the embryo, and confusion of lineages as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After a discussion of the matter and an exchange of opinions, the Council decided to retract the view that the third type mentioned is permissible, and in the seventh session, 1404 AH.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Qaraaraat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi (pp. 159-161).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to take the husband’s sperm and the wife’s egg and put the mixture in the womb of another wife of the husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to stipulate that the borrower must pay the difference in value if the currency drops?",
      "question": "<p>I am student in a British university. As a British student, the government here gives me a loan to complete my study. This loan is not interest-based, as it is mentioned in the terms and conditions. It will be also considered cancelled after 25 years of taking it. It must not be paid unless the student starts working with a salary of at least 15 000 pound a year. But it includes what is called inflationary interest, meaning that if the currency price drops by 0.01%, then I will have to pay this difference. <br />\n<br />\nI have asked a lot, many fatwa councils in Europe said that it is permissible loan, as well as many scholars did. But some scholars said it is haram, I do not know what to do?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible for     the one who borrows money from anyone to commit himself to repaying the loan     based on the value of the currency at the time when the loan is repaid,     rather he must repay the loan with the same value as it had at the time he     took it. This is the view of the majority of scholars both classical and     modern, and it is what is stated in fatwas issued by contemporary fiqh     councils. This applies if the currency remains in circulation, even if the     exchange rate changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the currency is     abolished altogether and the people no longer use it, in this case there are     different scholarly opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars say that the     borrower must pay back the value at the time of the loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some say that what counts     is its value at the time the currency is abolished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Others say that what     matters is its value at the time of paying it off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih     al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The view that is most     likely to be correct is the view that what counts is the value at the time     the currency is abolished, because he was responsible to pay ten fuloos [a     kind of currency] until it was abolished, i.e., if he had asked him for ten     fuloos one minute before it was abolished, he would have given him ten     fuloos, and it would have been binding on the lender to accept it. So if     that is the case, we should estimate the value to be paid at the time when     it is abolished. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti’     (9/104).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the ruling in the     case of the currency being abolished and another being used instead. But if     the currency is still valid and people are still using it, then it must be     repaid as it is, even if the rate of exchange is different and even if the     purchasing power has changed, and even if there is inflation. This is stated     in a report by the International Islamic Fiqh Council which belongs to the     Organization of the Islamic Conference, which is sufficient and good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Statement no. 115 (9/12)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Re:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inflation and change in     currency values&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Journal of the     International Islamic Fiqh Council which belongs to the Organization of the     Islamic Conference in its eighteenth session held in Riyadh, in the Kingdom     of Saudi Arabia, 25 Jumaada al-Aakhirah&nbsp; – 1 Rajab 1421 AH (23-28 September     2000 CE).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After studying the closing     statement of the Economic Fiqh Council for the Study of Inflation (in its     three sessions in Jeddah, Kuala Lumpur and al-Manaamah) and its     recommendations and suggestions, and after listening to the discussions on     this topic with the members and experts of the Council and a number of     fuqaha’, the following has been determined:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Affirmation of the     previous decision, no. 42 (4/5) which reads as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What matters with regard     to repayment of undisputed debts in a certain currency is that they should     be paid in the same currency, not the equivalent value, because debts are to     be paid off in the same form as the loan was given. It is not permissible to     connect debts owed, regardless of the nature of the debt, to changes in the     level of prices.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – In the event that     inflation is expected at the time of signing the contract, the contract may     be drawn up based on a currency or form of wealth other than that which is     expected to fall, such as basing the contract on the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (a)Gold or silver</p>\n<p>    (b)A similar product</p>\n<p>    (c)A basket (group) of similar     products</p>\n<p>    (d)Another, more stable currency</p>\n<p>    (e)A basket (group) of currencies</p>\n<p>Payment of the debt in the     examples given above must be in the same form as that on which the loan was     given, because the borrower is not obliged to pay back anything more than     what he actually received.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These cases are different     from the case which is forbidden, whereby the two parties involved in the     transaction do the deal on the basis of giving in one currency on condition     that the debt is paid back in another currency or a basket (group) of     currencies. The prohibition on this type of loan was issued in the Council’s     statement no. 75 (6/8).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – It is not permissible     in sharee’ah to agree when drawing up the contract to connect payment of the     debt to any of the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (a)a mathematical formula</p>\n<p>    (b)the index of living expenses or     any other index</p>\n<p>    (c)gold or silver</p>\n<p>    (d)the price of a specific item</p>\n<p>    (e)the average gross domestic     product</p>\n<p>    (f)another currency</p>\n<p>    (g)the rate of interest</p>\n<p>    (h)the average price of a basket     (group) or products</p>\n<p>That is because this kind     of connection may lead to many types of risk and unknown factors, to such an     extent that neither party knows what is owed or expected to be paid, so the     condition of clarity which is required for contracts to be sound will not be     met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If these things to which     the debt is connected increase in value, that will result in differences     between what is owed and what is expected to be paid, and if the contract is     based on that, it is riba. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This statement by the Fiqh     Council is in accordance with that which was stated in fatwas by the     Standing Committee, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Muhammad ibn     Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee for     Issuing Fatwas said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The borrower must pay the     pounds that he borrowed at the time when the lender asks for them, and the     difference in purchasing power does not affect anything, whether it has     increased or decreased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Lajnah     al-Daa’imah (14/146).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also the answer to     question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/23388\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">23388</a>, as it     deals with a similar question. The two answers complement one another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on handing the remote to<br />\n      your mother/father to put music on t.v?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Turning up the volume of music for one’s parents with    a remote control</p>\n<p>That is not permissible because it involves cooperating in sin, and    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“… but do not help one another in sin and    transgression.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>If you withhold the remote control and they get angry, they have no    right to do so, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:    “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the    Creator.” </p>\n<p>(Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 1041; it is a saheeh hadeeth).    </p>\n<p>The remote control you mention is merely a tool, the    person who is doing the action is you, and the responsibility rests with you. You have to    call your parents to give up evil things, inviting them with wisdom and beautiful    preaching, addressing them kindly and lowering to them the wing of humility. If Allaah    told Moosa and Haaroon to address the kaafir tyrant Pharaoh with kindness, as He said    (interpretation of the meaning), “And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept    admonition or fear (Allâh).” [Ta-Ha 20:44] – then your parents are more    deserving of being addressed mildly and gently. May Allaah guide us all to the path of    those who fear Him.</p>\n",

      "title": "Divorcing (talaaq) three times based on a belief that it is obligatory",
      "question": "<p>Me and my wife have had a rough couple of years. We got divorced when we both had little knowledge of this religion. For the first time she is willing to work out are marriage and I thank Allah that she has been thinking about this. It is imperative that this question be answered for me because it involves a family being united or seperated. When we first got seperated someone told her that you have to give talaq 3 times, so i gave her the first talaq willingly from my heart. After that we tried to work it out, But someone told her that it is obligatory to give the 2nd talaq even if one does not want to after 3 months and a 3rd one is obligatory after 6th months. So I was angry and didnt bother researching and asking about this. So when the 3 months were over i gave the second talaq without really wanting to but i thought i had to. When the 6 month came, i thought it was a sin upon me if i did not give it to her because this is what a view ignorant people told her and myself. So i waited longer then the 6 months sad that i was forced to give her the last one knowing she will not be available to me unless she marries, so out of anger and sadness i gave her the third talaq because i was told it was obligatory on me to do so. After that we were apart for a year since then but i always wanted to work it out. When i started studying fiqh under shayukh and in the masjid they told me to relate to them how i did my talaq. I told 3 or 4 people and they said subhanallah you may still be married if you thought you had to give the third. So now i relate my question to a proper scholar. We both now want to work it out, but this one last steps in the way. We live far apart now and I havent seen my son in 2 years because of no travel money and the only way to see him is to live with her and him again. So I wanted to know if she is still lawful for me because we both want to work it out. No shaykh has answered my question and i need an answer quickly, and i fear i may follow my desires if i do not get a response because i havent found any answer related to my situation.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If you only uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) on the second or third occasion because you believed that it was obligatory, as you had been told, then this talaaq does not count as such according to the more correct opinion, because if a person bases his talaaq on a reason, then finds out that that reason was not valid, his talaaq does not count as such.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have received your letter in which you ask about your divorce (talaaq) of your wife and you said that you heard something about her and you got angry and divorced her three times (threefold talaaq), then after that you found that the news you had heard was false and you became certain that it was not true, and you are asking whether this divorced counts as such or not, because it turned out that she is innocent of what was said about her.</p>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<p>If the situation is as mentioned and you only divorced her based on this false news, then the correct scholarly opinion is that this divorce does not count as such. Based on that, the divorce is invalid and your wife is permissible to you on the basis of the first marriage contract. There is no need to go through the process of taking her back or do a new marriage contract.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, 11/ question no. 3159</p>\n<p>See also question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/36835\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">36835</a></p>\n<p>The one who told you that made a serious mistake and spoke about Allah without knowledge.</p>\n<p>For a woman who menstruates, her ‘iddah is three menstrual cycles, not three months. If her husband gives her a revocable divorce and does not take her back during the ‘iddah, she becomes completely divorced and is not permissible for him except with a new marriage contract.</p>\n<p>As it has become clear that your second and third talaaq do not count as such, but you did not take your wife back during her ‘iddah following the first talaaq, then she has become completely divorced from you and cannot go back to you except with a new marriage contract that fulfils the necessary conditions.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

That excludes the reports that speak of the physical description of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); but this exclusion is only when talking about the Sunnah in the context of it being one of the sources of Shari`ah. In that context, the reports that speak of his description are not part of the Sunnah; rather the Sunnah is only based on his words, deeds and approval.” (Tahrir `Ulum Al-Hadith)</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the names of the saved group, the group that will continue to adhere to the commands of Allah, is “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12761\" target=\"_blank\">Ahl Al-Hadith</a> .” They are also called “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10777\" target=\"_blank\">Ahl As-Sunnah</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The books that deal with the transmission of reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Companions, and the words of the righteous early generations, are called “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/239540\" target=\"_blank\">Kutub Al-Hadith</a> ”; they are also called “Kutub As-Sunnah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Places_where_Hadith_and_Sunnah_mean_different_things\">Places where Hadith and Sunnah mean different things</span></h3>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term Sunnah is applied to the Prophet's (may the peace and blessings of Allah be on him) guidance which is well-established in a general sense in all of his affairs, meaning his path, his methodology and his way. In this context, scholars do not usually use the term “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/197164\" target=\"_blank\">Hadith</a> .” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-`Allamah As-Sayyid Sulayman An-Nadwi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>““Hadith” refers to every incident that is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), even if he only did it once in his life, and even if it was narrated from him by only one person. With regard to the word “Sunnah,” in reality it is used for his actions – I mean how the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) did things – that has been transmitted to us via mutawatir actions, in the sense that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did it, then the Companions did it after him, then the Successors did it after them, and so on. It does not necessarily mean that there is a narration describing that action; rather this refers to the way in which a particular act was performed and was passed down through the generations by means of tawatur (i.e., passed down by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could have all agreed upon a lie).&nbsp; This is what is called “Sunnah,” and this is mentioned alongside the Book (the Quran) in the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “I am leaving among you two things and you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger.” This is what it is not permissible for any Muslim, no matter who he is, to forsake or go against, otherwise he has no share in Islam.” (Majallat Al-Manar, 30/673)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scholars use the word <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/89878\" target=\"_blank\">“Sunnah” to describe adhering to Islam</a> in the manner prescribed, without adding to it or introducing innovations into the religion; they do not call that “Hadith.” For example, `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi Al-Mashhur said: Sufyan Ath-Thawri is an imam (leading scholar) in Hadith, but he is not an imam in Sunnah; al-Awza`i is an imam in Sunnah but he is not an imam in Hadith. Maik ibn Anas is an imam in both. (Tarikh Dimashq by Ibn `Asakir, 35/183)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Abu `Amr ibn As-Salah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of them said of Imam Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that he combined knowledge of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/604\" target=\"_blank\">Sunnah</a> and of Hadith; what is the difference between the Sunnah and Hadith?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah be pleased with him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In this context, Sunnah is the opposite of bid`ah (innovation). A person may be a scholar of Hadith yet also be an innovator. Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) combined both Sunnahs; he was a scholar of the Sunnah, i.e., Hadith, and also believed in the Sunnah, i.e., his way was that of Ahl al-haqq (the people of truth), with no bid `ah (innovation). And Allah knows best.” (Fatawa ibn As-Salah, 1/139-140)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurists use the word “Sunnah” when explaining the ruling on doing a specific action as being mustahabb (liked or encouraged); they do not use the word “Hadith” in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the scholars speak of reports and whether <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/134465\" target=\"_blank\">they are authentic or weak</a> , they only use the word “Hadith”; they do not use the word “Sunnah.” So they say “This is a weak Hadith”; they do not say “This is a weak Sunnah”, because of them the Sunnah is that which is proven in the Hadiths; therefore they sometimes say “This Hadith is contrary to analogy, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on eating cheese if the source of the rennet is not known",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on the presence of rennet in most of the cheeses we buy, when we do not know where it is derived from?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The substance that is put in cheese is rennet; it is a yellowish white substance in a vessel of skin which is extracted from the stomach of a calf or nursing lamb. A little of it is added to the milk, which curdles and becomes cheese.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/155).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ruling on rennet varies according to where it is taken from. If it is taken from an animal that has been slaughtered in accordance with sharee’ah, then it is pure and may be eaten. If it is taken from an animal that died of natural causes or an animal that was not slaughtered in accordance with sharee’ah, then there is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ concerning it. The majority of Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is najis. Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, according to the other report narrated from him, were of the view that it is taahir. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). He said in al-Fataawa (21/102): It is more likely that their cheese -- referring to the Magians -- is halaal and that the rennet from a dead animal (one that died of natural causes) and its milk are taahir. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said (35/154): With regard to cheese that is made with their rennet – i.e., from some of the baatini sects who are regarded as kaafirs – there are two well-known views concerning that among the scholars, as in the case of rennet from dead animals and rennet from animals slaughtered by the Magians and Franks, of whom it is said that they do not slaughter meat properly. The view of Abu Haneefah and of Ahmad according to one of the two reports narrated from him is that this cheese is permissible, because the rennet of dead animals is taahir according to this view, because then it does not die when the animal dies. The view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and of Ahmad according to the other report, is that this cheese is najis because in their view the rennet is najis, because the milk and rennet of the dead animal are najis according to them. If meat slaughtered by a particular person cannot be eaten, then meat slaughtered by him is like dead meat. Those who hold both views quoted as evidence reports that were narrated from the Sahaabah. Those who hold the first view narrate that the Sahaabah ate the cheese of the Magians, and those who hold the second view narrate that they ate what they thought was cheese of the Christians. This issue is subject to ijtihaad and one may follow the view of the Shaykh he asks. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the correct opinion. Whether you know the source of the rennet and that it comes from an animal that was slaughtered properly or otherwise, or you do not know, there is nothing wrong with eating cheese that has been made with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
