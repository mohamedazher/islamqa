      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>The Prophet ordered that all images be destroyed. </div>\n<div>Is it sufficient to erase just the eyes, or the face, or the head ?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The image is the face, which must be erased so that the image disappears, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade striking the “image”. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The meaning is that it is forbidden to strike the face, as was explained in other ahaadeeth. The fact that “image” means the face means that the facial features must be erased. And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Her husband is always busy playing or watching football. Can she get a TV?",
      "question": "<p>A husband of a good religious sister spends most of his time watching or playing football. She does not have a television at her home, Alhamdulillah. So her husband spends most of his time outside home to watch football. She does not have children. <br />\n<br />\nMy question:<br />\n<br />\nShall she just buy a television so that her husband stays with her at home? As she spends the whole day alone while her husband is away.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Playing football (soccer)     may be permissible or it may be haram, depending on whether the player     adheres to shar’i guidelines or goes against them. This has been explained     in the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/3633\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">3633</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/84291\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">84291</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/75644\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">75644</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A wise person should not     keep busy with playing it or watching it, even if it is permissible, because     time is a man’s capital, and undoubtedly the husband’s being busy with that     and staying out of the house because of it, is a shortcoming and negligence,     because time is too precious to waste, so how can he waste it on something     that brings no benefit? It would be better for him to take care of his     family and try to make them happy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for bringing a TV into     the home, we do not advise that, because of its obvious bad effects. Please see     question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/3633\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">3633</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seems that this     husband’s problem is not limited to the lack of a TV. He needs many things     to encourage him to stay home. The wise wife should look for ways to make     her husband want to stay home, such as treating him well, taking care of     him, adorning herself, looking for common interests, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We should also advise this     sister to make good use of her time in things that will benefit her     religious and worldly affairs, such as memorizing Quran, attending     halaqahs and lectures, learning some skills and doing housework. This is     better for her than bringing in a TV which will attract her to things that     Allah has forbidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on using relaxants and sleeping pills to treat anxiety and insomnia",
      "question": "<p><span>I want to know the rulings concerning self-medication in Islam</span>.</p>\n<p> <span>I have been going through a rough time in my marriage. My husband neglects me (i do not know intentionally or unintentionally). He spends all his day on his computer or phone playing games, talking to friends, continuously. We dont have one conversation where his phone doesnt interrupt us. And he hardly spends two hours uninterrupted with me throughout the day</span>.</p>\n<p> <span>We have had many fights about this in the past 2 years but I decided to do sabr and stay silent. However, I feel depressed, rejected, restless, and lonely and I cant sleep. So i turned to muscle relaxants. The kind I use are available without a prescription but I feel that I am dependent on them now. I have alot of hopelessness and anxiety but as soon as I take a relaxant I sleep and wake up feeling calm</span>.</p>\n<p> <span>I wasn't prescribed this by a doctor. I have a history of not being able to sleep properly and I use such medications on and off. Their affect starts 30 to 40 minutes after taking the pill and lasts for 4 to 6 hours - but even after this the pills keep me mentally and physically calm. I know intoxicants are haram in Islam. Will using such pills through self medication also stop my prayer from being accepted for 40 days? Can you tell me about any and all rulings concerning this</span>?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The wife has rights over her husband, namely kind treatment, maintenance, accommodation, and his being able to meet her physical needs in order to maintain her chastity and meet her emotional needs. All these rights are proven in the Quran and Sunnah.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the husband has rights over his wife, namely kind treatment, obedience in that which is right and proper, allowing him to be intimate with her, looking after him, and not going out of the house except with his permission. These rights and duties have been explained previously in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10680\" target=\"_blank\">10680</a> .</p>\n<p>With regard to what you have mentioned about your husband being distracted from you, the remedy for that is communication and looking for activities that you can do together, such as seeking knowledge, memorizing Quran, going on outings during your spare time, reducing use of the phone, and so on.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to use sleeping pills and relaxants except on the advice of a trustworthy doctor, because some of them can contain narcotics, some of them can cause addiction, and some of them do more harm than good.</p>\n<p>So treating yourself with this kind of medicine is prohibited, for the reasons we have mentioned.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on taking sleeping pills or what are called relaxants? Do they come under the heading of narcotics or not? Is that permissible in the case of necessity or if it is advised by a doctor?</p>\n<p>He replied: It is not permissible to use these pills except in the case of necessity, on condition that they be recommended by a knowledgeable doctor, because they are dangerous and have an impact on the function of the brain. If someone uses them, they may bring about relaxation for a short time, but that will be followed by a greater evil. So it is important to note that it is permissible to use them when there is a need for that, on condition that that be done under the supervision of a doctor and on his advice.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb</em> (tape no. 82, side A).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle regarding any medicine that contains any kind of narcotic is that it is probihited, but if they must be used for treatment and there is no permissible alternative, then in that case it is permissible to use them, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>1.. That the patient’s need for that medicine has reached the level of necessity or urgent need.</p>\n<p>2.. That a trustworthy Muslim doctor testifies that this narcotic medicine is indeed beneficial for the patient.</p>\n<p>3.. That use of the medicine is limited to the extent to which it will meet the necessity.</p>\n<p>4.. That this medicine will not cause the patient any harm greater than or equal to the harm for which it is being used.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/192321\" target=\"_blank\">192321</a> .</p>\n<p>Our advice to you is to seek the advice of a female doctor who is specialized in the medicine that you are using; to reduce your use of medicines in general; and to seek help to treat your anxiety and insomnia by means of beneficial kinds of treatment that are prescribed in Islamic teachings, such as reading Quran, remembering Allah and sending blessings upon His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him),&nbsp; for that will bring reassurance to the heart and dispel worries.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah . Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured” [ar-Ra‘d 13:28]</em>.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When two thirds of the night had passed, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and said: “O people, remember Allah, O people, remember Allah, for the first Trumpet blast at which the earth will tremble has come, and it will be followed by the second Trumpet blast. Death has come, with all that it entails, death has come with all that it entails.” Ubayy said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I send a great deal of blessings upon you; how much of my du`a should be sending blessings upon you? He said: “Whatever you wish.” I said: One quarter? He said: “Whatever you wish, and if you do more, that will be better for you.” I said: One half? He said: “Whatever you wish and if you do more, that will be better for you.” I said: Two thirds? He said: “Whatever you wish and if you do more, that will be better for you.” I said: I will make all of my du`a sending blessing upon you. He said: “Then your concerns will be taken care of and your sins will be forgiven.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2457); classed as hasan by al-Albani in <em>Saheeh at-Tirmidhi</em>.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi</em>: “how much of my du`a should be sending blessings upon you?” means: instead of my du`a that I offer for myself? This was stated by al-Qaari.</p>\n<p>Sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the greatest means of attaining reassurance and peace of mind, and relief from worries and distress.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to rectify your husband’s condition and to take away your distress and sorrow.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If someone sneezes and does not say al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allaah) should I remind him?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Saying Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you)     is only prescribed for one who sneezes and praises Allaah. If someone     sneezes and does not praise Allaah, then it is not prescribed to say     Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you to him), or to remind him     to praise Allaah, because of the saheeh report from the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) according to which two men sneezed in     his presence and he said Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on     you) to one of them but not to the other. The man said: O Messenger of     Allaah, you said Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you) to     him but not to me. He said: “He praised Allaah and you did not.” If     reminding the one who sneezes was prescribed, then the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have reminded this man to say     al-hamdu Lillah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

      "question": "<p>What do you say about the following hadiths ?</p>\n<p>1. Sayyiduna al-Lajlaj (radiyallahu’anhu), a companion of Rasulullah (sallallahu’alaihi wasallam), had bequeathed his son that after he leaves this world, he should recite the beginning and end of Surah al-Baqarah at the head side of his grave. Sayyiduna al-Lajlaj (radiyallahu’anhu) then mentioned that he heard this from Rasulullah (sallallahu’alaihi wasallam). (al-Mu’jamul-Kabir of Imam Tabarani; Hafiz Haythami has regarded the narrators of this tradition as reliable – refer Majmu’uz-zawa’id vol.3 pg.44)</p>\n<p>2. This has also been recorded to be the practice of Sayyiduna ‘Abdullah ibn ‘‘Umar (radiyallahu’anhuma) in Sunanul-Kubra of Imam al-Bayhaqi (vol.4 pg.56). This narration has been classified as hasan (sound) by Imam Nawawi and Hafiz ibn Hajar (rahimahumallah). (al-Adhkar pg.212 Hadith493 &amp; al-Futuhatur-Rabbaniyyah vol.3 Sayyiduna Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) relates that he heard the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) say: “When one of you passes away, do not keep his body for long and take him quickly to his grave, and have the opening verses of Surat al-Baqarah recited at his head and the concluding verses of Surat al-Baqarah recited at his feet.” (Recorded by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Iman and he said: The reality is that this is a statement of Abdullah ibn Umar (mawquf). See: Mishkat al-Masabih no: 1717)</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (491) via ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn al-‘Alaa’ ibn al-Lajlaaj, from his father who said: My father said to me: O my son, when I die, then bury me, and when you place me in my lahd (niche in the grave), say: In the name of Allah and in accordance with the religion of the Messenger of Allah. Then fill in the grave, then recite at my head the beginning and end of Soorat al-Baqarah, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say that.</p>\n<p>It was narrated by al-Bayhaqi (7068), by al-Khallaal in al-Amr bi’l-Ma‘roof wa’n-Nahy ‘an al-Munkar (p. 87), and by ad-Daynoori in al-Mujaalasah (757) as follows:</p>\n<p>When I die, then place me in the lahd (niche in the grave) and say: In the name of Allah and in accordance with the religion of the Messenger of Allah. Then fill in the grave, then recite at my head the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah), and the beginning and end of al-Baqarah, for I heard ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar say that.</p>\n<p>The second version is attributed to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, therefore it is mawqoof.</p>\n<p>This is a da‘eef (weak) isnad. ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn al-‘Alaa’ ibn al-Lajlaaj is majhool (unknown). Adh-Dhahabi said in al-Mizaan (2/579):</p>\n<p>No one narrated from him except Mubashshir ibn Ismaa‘eel. End quote.</p>\n<p>Those who accepted this report relied on the fact that Ibn Hibbaan described this ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as being thiqah (trustworthy), but Ibn Hibbaan (may Allah have mercy on him) is known for being too lenient in describing narrators as trustworthy, to the extent that he might include among the trustworthy a narrator of whom he clearly stated that he did not know who he or his father were. Hence al-Haafiz said in his biography of this ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan in at-Taqreeb (p. 348): His reports may be accepted if there are corroborating reports, otherwise his reports are regarded as layyin (a kind of weak hadith), as was stated in al-Muqaddimah.</p>\n<p>The saheeh (sound) report from Ibn ‘Umar is that which was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1046) via Naafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say, when the deceased was placed in the grave: “Bismillah wa billah wa ‘ala millati Rasoolillah ( In the name of Allah, with the help of Allah, and in accordance with the religion of the Messenger of Allah).”</p>\n<p>Following this report, at-Tirmidhi said:</p>\n<p>This hadith is hasan ghareeb with this isnad. This hadith was narrated with another isnad from Ibn ‘Umar, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It was narrated by Abu’s-Siddeeq an-Naaji, from Ibn ‘Umar, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). And it was also narrated from Abu’s-Siddeeq an-Naaji, from Ibn ‘Umar, in a mawqoof report.

Ayyoob ibn Naheek was classed as da‘eef (weak) by Abu Haatim and others. Al-Azdi said: He is matrook (to be rejected).</p>\n<p>Mizaan al-I‘tidaal (1/294).</p>\n<p>Regarding al-Baablutti, Ibn Abi Haatim said: He narrates problematic reports from trustworthy narrators in which he seems to be confused, so the reports of which he is the only narrator are not to be quoted as evidence. Ibn ‘Adiyy said: The impact of weakness on his hadith is obvious.</p>\n<p>Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (11/211).</p>\n<p>Al-Albaani said in ad-Da‘eefah (4140): A very weak (da‘eef jiddan) hadith.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (1/192).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Protecting societies from zina",
      "question": "<p>How can four witnesses be brought against the man and woman who commit zina in the present age? <br />\n<br />\nHow can we advise our Muslim youth against this evil action? May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars have listed the ways of establishing proof of     zina, and there are four ways:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-Testimony of witnesses</p>\n<p>    2-Admission by the parties     concerned</p>\n<p>    3-Pregnancy of a woman who has no     husband or master</p>\n<p>    4-If the husband engages in     li’aan and the wife refuses to take part in li’aan</p>\n<p>    With regard to witnesses to zina, they should be four people     whose testimony is acceptable, and they should state that they have seen the     zina in clear terms, i.e., they should have seen the man’s penis in the     woman’s vagina.&nbsp; If some of them only testify that they saw them naked, or     they describe certain positions or movements, that is not sufficient to     proof that zina took place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in    al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/157):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They should describe zina in clear terms, such as saying: “I     saw his penis in her vagina”. There is no alternative to that. If they say:     “We saw him on top of her and they were naked”, that is not acceptable. Even     if they say “We saw him doing with her what a man does with his wife,” that     is not sufficient as testimony. They must say “We bear witness that his     penis was in her vagina.” And this is very difficult, as the man said who     was testified against at the time of ‘Umar: “If you were among the (four)     thighs you would never be able to give this testimony.” Hence Shaykh     al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah mentioned that at his time no case of zina was proven     by means of testimony from the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) until the time of Ibn Taymiyah. If no case was proven     from that time until the other, then we do not know of any case that was     proven by testimony up till our own times, because it is very difficult. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This strictness with regard to testimony about zina serves     only to achieve the purpose aimed at by sharee’ah, which is to conceal     people and not spread immorality, and to make societies avoid accusations     against people’s honour and aspersions on their lineages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (5/83):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has stated that testimony in a case of zina must be     given by four people, so as to make it hard for those who are testifying to     such a thing, and to conceal people. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer     (1/563): “Why did they not produce four witnesses?” [al-Noor 24:13],     i.e., why did the accusers not bring witnesses to the things they accused     them of? “four witnesses” i.e., of good character. “Since they     (the slanderers) have not produced witnesses! Then with Allaah they are the     liars” – even if they are certain about that in themselves, they are     liars in Allaah’s judgement, because Allaah has forbidden them to speak of     that without four witnesses. Hence Allaah says: “Then with Allaah they     are the liars”, and He did not say “Then they are the liars”. All of     this points to the grave sanctity of the Muslim’s honour, so it is not     permissible to make accusations against it without establishing testimony.     End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answers to questions no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/839\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">839</a> and     <a href=\"/en/answers/6926\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">6926</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to protecting our youth and our societies against     this evil, it is essential that there be a concerted effort on the parts of     nations and societies, on various fronts. It is a communal responsibility,     not an individual one. It is not possible to attain the well being of     societies without integrated efforts to adopt the means that will protect     them against zina and its effects. These means include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – Spreading awareness of the seriousness of the sin of     zina, and that it is one of the major sins which common sense and sharee’ah     agree is abhorrent and haraam; explaining that it is the cause of nations’     downfall and that it brings calamities upon this world, and the punishment     of Hell on the Day of Resurrection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Ahmad said: After murder, there is nothing worse than     zina. Ghadha’ al-Albaab (2/435).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a     Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an     evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah forgives him)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:32]</p>\n<p>    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer     (1/457):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah describes zina and its evil as “a Faahishah (i.e.     anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin” i.e., a sin that is     abhorrent according to sharee’ah, common sense and sound human nature,     because it is a transgression against the rights of Allaah, the rights of     the woman, the rights of her family, and the rights of her husband, and it     is spreading immorality, confusing lineages and other evils. The phrase “and     an evil way” means it is an evil way for the one who dares to commit     this grave sin. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Making the youth aware of the bad effects that result from     the spread of this evil, which threatens the stability of families and     societies, such as the spread of fatal diseases, the prevalence of     illegitimate children, disintegration of the family, children not being     cared for properly and having a bad upbringing, increase in the divorce     rate, spread of crime and so on. These effects are felt by the societies in     which permissiveness in its worst forms is widespread, which could lead to     disintegration of those societies and the downfall of those civilizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – Striving to facilitate the shar’i way to have sexual     relationships, which is through halaal marriage, by encouraging marriage and     explaining that sharee’ah encourages it, and that it is the way of the     Messengers, and that the one who gets married has completed half of     religion, and that he will be rewarded for keeping himself and his wife     chaste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    4 – One of society’s responsibilities in this matter is to     remove the obstacles that cause delays in getting married. So they should     address the poverty that may be an obstacle to marriage, and provide the     material means to young people who do not possess enough to keep themselves     chaste. In his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning):     “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and     the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and     capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants (female slaves). If     they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is     All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knowing (about the state of the     people)” [al-Noor 24:32], al-Qurtubi said: Marry those among you who     have no spouse, for that is the way to achieve chastity. End quote     (12/239).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the book al-Amwaal by Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn     Salaam (251) it says that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez wrote to his governor in     Iraq saying: Seek out every unmarried man who has no wealth and if he wants     to get married, then arrange his marriage and give charity to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Mughni (7/587):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    A man must keep his son chaste if he needs to get married,     and this is the apparent meaning of the view of al-Shaafa’i. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    5 – The least that societies and parents can do with regard     to this important issue is to stop going to extremes with regard to dowries,     or showing off and indulging in excess with regard to the expenses of     marriage, or trying to acquire wealth from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab delivered a speech from the minbar and     said:</p>\n<p>    “Do not go to extremes with regard to the dowries of women,     for if that were a sign of honour and dignity in this world or a sign of     piety before Allaah, then Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) would have done that before you. But he did not give any of his wives,     and none of his daughters were given, more than twelve uqiyah.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Abu Dawood (2106); classed as saheeh by     al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Wise people do not disagree on the point that parents’ going     to extremes with regard to their daughters’ dowries is one of the causes of     the spread of corruption and immorality in their societies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Will Durant said, speaking of the spread of immorality in     some western societies in some era of history in his book Mabaahij     al-Falsafah (The Pleasures of Philosophy) (127-128):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no dispute that this is to some extent due to the     demands for high dowries made by fathers as the price for their chastity at     a time when marriage was, frankly, a commodity to be bought. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    6 – One of the most important means by which societies may     ward off the evil of zina is spreading an atmosphere of love between     spouses, and striving towards the happiness of families by means of love,     respect, sincerity, loyalty, rights and duties, for happy families and     loving couples are a means of protecting society from deviation and falling     into immorality in search of illusionary happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    7 – Finally, it is essential to strive to establish a     conservative and religiously-committed environment which is connected to     Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, in which wanton display and     unveiling are unknown, and in which ‘awrahs are covered, in which alcohol     and music, which are the promoters of zina, are forbidden, because these     things are the fuel for the fire of immorality, so if the society rids     itself of them, it will be safe from that fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You may also benefit from reading the answers to the     following questions on this website: <a href=\"/en/answers/20161\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">20161</a> and     <a href=\"/en/answers/3234\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">3234</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Useful books on this subject include al-Tadaabeer     al-Waaqiyah min al-Zina by Fadl Ilaahi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

My friends are very knowledgeable and practising but they have boyfriends whom they chat to and at time meet. They have not fornicated but they do have a lot of intimacy e.g hugging, kissing etc. I do not know what to tell them, as they are aware it is wrong and regret after they have done such things. Is the ibadah od such a person accepted? Is there salah accepted and will they be rewarded. There excuse is that they are too emotionally attached and that they will be marrying that person. Please advice.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    The people who should be most committed to obeying the     commands of Allaah and heeding His prohibitions are those whom He has     blessed with guidance, knowledge of Islam and following the path of     religious commitment, so how can people like these friends whom you describe     as being religiously committed agree to follow in the footsteps of the     shaytaan by doing that which Allaah has forbidden? Should they not be     grateful for the blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon them by guiding them     to Islam and religious commitment, so they should be the best examples of     righteousness to others?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the fact that these friends of yours know that they     are doing something haraam, that counts for nothing here. Who says that mere     knowledge is what prevents a person from falling into sin? Didn’t Iblees     know that what his Lord enjoined upon him was true? Didn’t the Jews know     that the Prophet was true? And so on and so forth. Allaah, may He be     exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Do they not travel in the land, and see what was the end     of those before them? They were superior to them in strength, and they     tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these (pagans)     have done, and there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs.     Surely, Allaah wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves”</p>\n<p>    [al-Room 30:9]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And they belied them (those Ayaat) wrongfully and     arrogantly, though their ownselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those     (Ayaat) are from Allaah, and Moosa (Moses) is the Messenger of Allaah in     truth, but they disliked to obey Moosa (Moses), and hated to believe in his     Message of Monotheism]. So see what was the end of the Mufsidoon     (disbelievers, and disobedient to Allaah, evildoers liars)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Naml 27:14]</p>\n<p>    But the point here is that the one who knows, and exhorts     others, and speaks, bears a greater responsibility, and his going against     the knowledge that he has is worse and more reprehensible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and     every act of obedience to Allaah) on the people and you forget (to practise     it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture! Have you then no sense?”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:44]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not     do?</p>\n<p>    3.&nbsp;Most hateful it is with Allaah that you say that which     you do not do”</p>\n<p>    [al-Saff 61:2-3]</p>\n<p>    What you must do is remind your friends of their duties, as     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Therefore remind (men) in case the reminder profits     (them).</p>\n<p>    10.&nbsp;The reminder will be received by him who fears     (Allaah)”</p>\n<p>    [al-A’la 87:9-10]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious), when an     evil thought comes to them from Shaytaan (Satan), they remember (Allaah),     and (indeed) they then see (aright)”</p>\n<p>    [al-A’raaf 7:201]</p>\n<p>    Remind them that this is abhorrent for any Muslim, male or     female, so how about if the Muslim woman is one who outwardly makes a     display of commitment to the religion of Allaah, and sets an example for     people, and calls people to Allaah? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (3267) and Saheeh Muslim     (2989) it is narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased with him)     said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) say: “A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown     into the Fire; his intestines will spill forth and he will go around them as     a donkey goes around the millstone. The people of Hell will gather around     him and will say: O So and so, what is the matter with you? Did you not     enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil? He will say: Yes, but I used to     enjoin good and not do it, and I used to forbid evil and do it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of a scholar who teaches good to     the people but forgets about himself is that of a lamp that illuminates the     people but burns itself.” Narrated by al-Khateeb in Iqtida’ al-‘Ilm     (49) and elsewhere; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’     no. 5831.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I have seen sins deaden hearts and persisting in them may     lead to humiliation </p>\n<p>    Forsaking sin brings life to the heart and it is better for     your soul to go against whims and desires</p>\n<p>    Does anything corrupt the religion more than kings and bad     priests and monks</p>\n<p>    Who sell their souls but did not make any gain and did not     sell them for the right price</p>\n<p>    Because they are like one that feeds upon a corpse and every     wise man knows such as one is a loser.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the excuse of emotional attachment towards the     boyfriend, this is the essence of whims and desires which lead one to doom,     Allaah forbid. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires)     as his ilaah (god)? And Allaah knowing (him as such), left him astray, and     sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who then     will guide him after Allaah? Will you not then remember?”</p>\n<p>    [al-Jaathiyah 45:23]</p>\n<p>    Qataadah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: He does not     feel attracted to anything but it will control him, because he does not fear     Allaah. Tafseer al-Tabari (22/76).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah describes chaste believing women as those who avoid     having boyfriends. He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed     free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those (slaves)     whom your right hands possess, and Allaah has full knowledge about your     Faith; you are one from another. Wed them with the permission of their own     folk (guardians, Awliyaa’ or masters) and give them their Mahr according to     what is reasonable; they (the above said slave-girls) should be chaste, not     committing illegal sex, nor taking boyfriends”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:25]</p>\n<p>    Al-musaafihaat (translated here     as “committing illegal sex”) means women who fornicate or commit adultery,     who commit immoral actions. As for taking boyfriends, this refers to women     who make friends with men and take them as close friends, as Ibn ‘Abbaas and     others among the salaf said. [See: Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/261].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    By the same token, Allaah describes the chaste men who seek     what is permissible and good. He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Made lawful to you this day are At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds     of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered     eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food     (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews     and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you     in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those     who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you     have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at     the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock)     not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends.     And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allaah and in     all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allaah’s) Angels, His Holy Books,     His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al‑Qadar (Divine     Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter he will     be among the losers”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:5]</p>\n<p>    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Just as He     stipulated that women should be chaste, He also stipulated the same for men,     which means that men should also be chaste. Hence He says “not committing     illegal sexual intercourse”, which refers to those who commit     fornication or adultery, who would not refrain from any sin and would     indulge in sin whenever the opportunity arises, “nor taking them as     girlfriends,” i.e., mistresses with whom they satisfy their sexual     desires.

      "title": "She thinks that Islam is not suited to the modern woman",
      "question": "<p><span>There is a girl in my locality, who holds following beliefes</span></p>\n<p><span>1. Women are more active and sometimes superior to man. </span></p>\n<p><span>2. Man can't live without woman and want her body. Do, she hates all men. </span></p>\n<p><span>3. She wears hijab and says it empowers her and gives her freedom from against the \"dominance\" of man. </span></p>\n<p><span>4.

She distorts the idea of jihad and says there's no jihad in this age. </span></p>\n<p><span>6. Once she was told how she views cooking, she replied that cooking is for man and it's not the job of woman. </span></p>\n<p><span>7. She says she's proud to be a muslim and says shes struggling to establish \"modern islam\" So, shaykh what advice I can give to her as she's my classmate</span>?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There are some positive aspects to this girl which we must point out. Her pride in Islam is something praiseworthy, as is her keenness to belong to Islam, her admiration of its values, and her commitment to its teachings, such as the hijab for example, whether she calls it modern Islam or some other name. It does not matter what she calls it if she can understand the concept behind that name in a proper manner, far removed from the influence of emotions that young people usually feel, and far away from extreme ideas that result from the crisis that the Muslim ummah is going through in reaction to the domination of modernity.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is a difference in approach between talking to an older woman who has gone through a lot of life experiences, and has read, heard and researched things, until she formed a certain conviction that what she believes is sound and it is very difficult for her to change her views – rather she strives to defend them –</p>\n<p>and talking to a young girl of sixteen, who does not have enough knowledge, education or life experience to her credit; rather she is still at the stage of growth and development, and has not yet reached the age of maturity and her ideas are not yet fully formed, and she has formed whatever ideas she has on the basis of limited experience, or merely listening to one experience of someone else, or imitating a particular person.</p>\n<p>Such ideas and thoughts that accumulate and dominate the mind of a person when he is physically and intellectually immature will quickly change, the more intellectually mature the person becomes and the more he goes through life experiences and increases in knowledge.</p>\n<p>Based on that: it is important to differentiate between the ideas of this young woman, some of which are acceptable and some are to be rejected or, more precisely, between general ideas that have nothing to do with religious principles – rather they are personal impressions that are subject to change as the person gains more experience – and religious concepts or beliefs which could have an impact on the fundamentals of religion.</p>\n<p>Her idea that women are superior in terms of energy and hard work, and her dislike of the idea that there is natural attraction between the sexes, and her suggesting that men should participate in cooking and preparation of food, are all matters that do not reach the level of beliefs or doctrines, as you mentioned at the beginning of your question. That is because they are no more than passing thoughts and personal desires that she chooses for herself and her evaluation of some permissible deeds. There is nothing wrong with her thinking about the women around her as being more active, working harder and serving others in a manner that is superior to what she sees from the men, whether they are other female students who outperform the male students – which is something that happens often – or she sees that among some outstanding women around her. That could very well be the case, and there is no doubt about it, but to be fair, we should note that women surpassing men is something rare, because if we look at men and women together as a whole, we will see that men do surpass women with regard to working hard and being active and energetic. The reality of people’s lives attests to that.</p>\n<p>Look at all nations of the world, advanced or otherwise: how many female presidents are there, how many female prime ministers, how many female ministers, how many female CEOs of large corporations or major companies, and so on?</p>\n<p>You will undoubtedly find some women in such positions, but they are very few when compared with the number of men in such positions.</p>\n<p>This fact is an affirmation that you will find in all peoples in the world, despite the differences in their religions and cultures. This confirms that men are more capable than women of successfully performing in these high positions, and that is the natural disposition that Allah has instilled in people.</p>\n<p>Also look at inventors, explorers, scholars and scientists throughout all of human history, which is not limited to the Muslims alone; what is the ratio of women to men?</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly it is very small, and women in such roles are rare.</p>\n<p>Women who are superior to some men do exist, and that cannot be denied, but their numbers are very few. This idea, in this sense, is not contrary to Islam at all. Some of the scholars have clearly stated that.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If you say: “Men are better than women,” that does not mean that each individual man is superior to each individual woman. Rather what is meant is that this category in general terms is superior to that category, even though there may be individual women who are superior to some men.\"(A<em>l-Usul min ‘Ilm al-Usul</em>&nbsp; p.36).</p>\n<p>Something similar was stated in <em>Fawatih al-Rahamut</em> (p. 1/440).</p>\n<p>Something similar may be said about her idea that men are interested in women’s bodies, and she hates men because of their gender. We do not think that these are “beliefs”, as you called them at the beginning of your question. They are not beliefs or principles of any significance or any religious dimension. Rather they are only feelings or emotions which your friend is expressing without thinking. The cause of that – as appears to be the case – is some painful experiences that she has lived through, or some unpleasant scenes or experiences that she faced or heard about, which led to her forming these impressions and phobias regarding these matters.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps that stems from some inner desire, such as thinking highly of herself or seeking to elevate herself and try to rise above her imagined weaknesses. These are just thoughts and aspirations that many people have, especially at a young age and at the time of adolescence.</p>\n<p>All of this is something that may change, or at least is something that is changeable with the first successful or beneficial experience she goes through. Her situation may easily improve with more education in the wider world beyond her narrow surroundings, so she will see the wisdom behind human integration between the male and female genders, which goes beyond the short-lived sexual dimension to an intangible spiritual dimension based on values that result from this integration between the sexes, as the Lord of Glory, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought}&nbsp;[ar-Rum 30:21].</p>\n<p>This mistaken view, even though it is held by some women, is something that we hope will change soon, before it affects the personal life of this young woman and she causes some harm to herself which she will regret when regret will not benefit her.</p>\n<p>What will help her to change her point of view – in addition to what we have mentioned above – is noting that the majority of women of different cultures and religions do not think in that way – because it is contrary to human nature. The evidence for that is the fact that the number of married women is always greater than the number of unmarried women; moreover, many of these unmarried women – in fact most of them – are not happy with their situation, and each of them wishes that she was a mother or had a family.</p>\n<p>As for her talking about the situation of women in secular countries, the reason for that, in our view, is twofold:</p>\n<p>Firstly, it stems from lack of knowledge (ignorance) of the status of women in Islamic teachings, the high esteem in which woman is held in Islam, the recognition of her rights, how Islam protects her dignity and instructs men to treat women kindly and not to mistreat them. Rather she is looking at some Muslim societies which may go against the teachings of Islam and mistreat and oppress women. Islam has nothing to do with that; rather these are mistakes and the responsibility for them rests with the one who does that and he is the one who will be brought to account for it. Such things should not be attributed to Islam.</p>\n<p>Secondly: it stems from not looking at the real situation in society in the light of official numbers and precise statistics which describe what women are going through in those secular societies, and from being deceived by some apparent freedoms for women that this girl sees here and there. In this regard, it is sufficient to draw this girl’s attention to the international acknowledgement of incidents of sexual harassment, rape and appalling sexual exploitation, news of which has reached everywhere and people everywhere talk about it, to the extent that there are reports that half of British women have faced sexual harassment of different types, according to the BBC.</p>\n<p>If you look, fairly and objectively at the following statistics, you will realize that the matter is more subtle and deeper than may appear at first to be case:</p>\n<p>1.. 10.4 million families in America are headed by single mothers who are the sole providers for their families, according to the US Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>2.. More than one million children are killed by abortion every year in the United States of America, according to the American government Centers for Disease Control.</p>\n<p>3.. 683,000 women annually are subjected to rape in America, at a rate of seventy-eight women per hour, as stated by the American Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>4.. 1320 women are killed annually, meaning that approximately four women are killed every day, by their husbands or boyfriends in America.</p>\n<p>5.. Approximately three million women every year in America are subject to physical abuse from a husband or boyfriend. Source: the official government website of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>6.. 22.1% of women in America are subjected to physical abuse by a husband or boyfriend (current or former), according to the US Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>7.. A report issued by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that most women in the West work in low-wage and low status jobs, and despite the pressure that the government exerts to improve women’s jobs, 97% of higher leadership positions in most companies are occupied by men.</p>\n<p>8.. 78% of women in the armed forces are subjected to sexual harassment from military employees.</p>\n<p>9.. In America, a woman’s body is a commodity that is traded to the extent that women are treated like animals. The aim of that is mere sexual pleasure, to the extent that some widely known restaurants there serve food on the naked bodies of women, and some car washes offer car washing services done by naked women, and waitresses serve coffee in one of the most famous restaurants wearing bikinis, as was published in major American newspapers such as the <em>New York Times</em> (18-4-2007, 24-8-2008, etc).</p>\n<p>10.. Approximately fifty thousand women and girls are trafficked into the United States every year, where they are enslaved and forced into prostitution, according to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n<p>11.. Exploitation of women’s bodies in various permissive ways is an industry that brings in twelve billion dollars annually in America alone, according to a report on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.reuters.com</a></p>\n<p>12.. Half of American women above the age of seventy-five years live alone, as noted by the American Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>13.. Women were not given the right to vote in America until 1920 CE.</p>\n<p>14.. According to a study carried out in fourteen countries, it was shown that 42% of British people admit having illicit relationships with more than one person at the same time, whilst half of Americans have illicit relationships. The rate in Italy is 38% and in France it is 36%, according to the BBC.</p>\n<p>There is an almost endless list of dark, hidden pages which speak of the situation of women in materialistic Western civilisation, all of which have been documented on official Western websites which constitute trustworthy and reliable sources for such statistics.</p>\n<p>Please see the statistics on <a href=\"http://www.alukah.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.alukah.net</a></p>\n<p>With regard to her view on jihad, it is a mistaken view, the source of which is ignorance of the rulings on jihad in Islam and the wisdom behind its prescription.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Goodness is tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection: reward and booty.”</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The booty that is associated with reward is only acquired by means of fighting on horses in jihad.\"(<em>Fath al-Bari</em>&nbsp; 6/56).</p>\n<p>This hadith clearly indicates that jihad will continue until the Day of Resurrection.

      "question": "<p>Is describing a person as boring regarded as coming under the heading of backbiting (gheebah)? Please note that this person was not present when these words were spoken. Is it regarded as backbiting if these words were spoken in a moment of anger? Please advise me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave a clear definition of backbiting. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you know what backbiting is?” They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “When you say about your brother something that he dislikes.” They said: What if what I say about my brother is true? He said: “If it is true then you have backbitten about him and if it is not true then you have told a grave lie about him.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (2589).</p>\n<p>Maalik narrated in al-Muwatta’ (3/150) that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (sa) (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): What is backbiting? He said: “When you say about your brother something that he does not like to hear.” He said: O Messenger of Allah, even if it is true? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you say something untrue, then that is a grave lie.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (1992).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Backbiting only refers to speaking ill of a person in his absence, when he is not present. As for criticising him in his presence, this comes under the heading of insulting and reviling, and is also haraam.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Insulting a Muslim is an evil action and fighting him is disbelief (kufr).”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (48) and Muslim (64).</p>\n<p>And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not envy one another, do not artificially inflate prices, do not hate one another, do not turn away from one another, do not undercut one another. Be, O slaves of Allah, brothers. The Muslim is the brother of his fellow-Muslim. He does not wrong him, let him down or despise him. Piety (taqwa) is here” – and he pointed to his chest three times. “It is sufficient evil for a man to despise his Muslim brother. The whole of a Muslim is sacred to another Muslim, his blood, his wealth and his honour.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (2564).</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Ibn at-Teen said: Backbiting (gheebah) means saying about a man in his absence that which he dislikes. This was also stated by az-Zamakhshari and Abu Nasr al-Qushayri in at-Tafseer, and by Ibn Khamees in a book on this topic, and by al-Mundhiri and more than one of the scholars, one of the last of whom was al-Kirmaani. He said: Backbiting means saying behind a man’s back what he would dislike if he heard it, even if it is true. End quote from Fat-h al-Baari (10/469).</p>\n<p>Al-Jirjaani said: Backbiting means saying bad things about a person in his absence, when they are true; if they are not true, then it is a grave lie, and if it is said to his face, then it is reviling or insulting.</p>\n<p>End quote from at-Ta‘reefaat (p. 163)</p>\n<p>Conclusion: your saying about your Muslim brother that he is boring, meaning that people do not like to sit with him because his character, words and manner are tedious, comes under the heading of backbiting which is haraam, even if it is said in a moment of anger, because anger does not make it permissible to cast aspersions upon your brother who has not wronged you.</p>\n<p>There is a stern warning against backbiting that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so hasten to repent and to apologise to your brother if he has heard about what you said concerning him. If he has not heard about it, then you should seek the forgiveness of Allah, may He be exalted, and pray for your brother.</p>\n<p>See also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/23328\" target=\"_blank\">23328</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/6308\" target=\"_blank\">6308</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
