      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on opening a clinic for ruqyah (Quranic healing) and cupping in return for payment?",
      "options": [
        "It is permissible to receive payment for ruqyah and open a clinic for it, whether at home or in rented premises",
        "It is only permissible if done at home without specializing in it as a profession",
        "It is prohibited because earning money through reciting Quran was not known among the salaf",
        "It is permissible only if the payment goes entirely to charity and not for personal needs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "It is permissible to receive payment for ruqyah and to open a clinic for it, as proven in al-Saheehayn where the Companions performed ruqyah for payment and the Prophet (peace be upon him) approved it, saying 'You did the right thing.' The scholars stated there is no difference whether this is done at home or in a rented place. Shaykh Ibn Baaz and the Standing Committee affirmed that if ruqyah follows the prescribed Islamic methods, the work is permissible and rewarded, and receiving payment is allowed."

      "question": "According to Islamic teachings, what are the conditions for keeping pets?",
      "options": [
        "The animal must not be a dog (except guard or hunting dogs), must not involve blameworthy extravagance, and must be treated kindly with proper food and drink",
        "Only birds are permissible to keep as pets, while all other animals must be kept for farming or work purposes",
        "All animals are permissible to keep as long as they are kept in cages to prevent them from roaming freely",
        "Pets are only permissible for children under the age of ten, and adults must not keep any animals except for work"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The conditions for keeping pets include: (1) The animal must not be a dog, because Islam forbids keeping dogs except guard and hunting dogs, as angels do not enter a house with a dog; (2) Not going to blameworthy extravagance by spending thousands or millions on animals; (3) Treating the animal kindly by providing proper food and drink, not harming it, and not using it for target practice or animal fights. The Prophet (peace be upon him) told of a man who entered Paradise for giving water to a thirsty dog, and a woman who entered Hell for detaining a cat without feeding it."

      "question": "What is the ruling on reading the Quran from the Mushaf while lying down in bed for someone with no health problems?",
      "options": [
        "There is nothing wrong with it, as the Prophet used to lie in Aishah's lap and recite Quran, but one must have wudu to touch the Mushaf",
        "It is prohibited because lying down shows disrespect to the Quran and one must sit upright when reading",
        "It is only permissible if one is reciting from memory, but reading from the Mushaf requires standing or sitting",
        "It is permissible only during the night before sleep, but during the day one must maintain a respectful sitting position"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran from the Mushaf while lying down. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to lie in Aishah's lap and recite Quran, which indicates it is permissible to read Quran when reclining and lying down. Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan stated that a person may recite Quran in any position - standing, sitting, or reclining - and whether with wudu or in minor impurity if reciting from memory. However, if reading from the Mushaf, it is not permissible to touch it without wudu."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on standing for a minute's silence in mourning for someone who has died?",
      "options": [
        "It is a reprehensible innovation not done by the Prophet or Companions, and imitates the customs of disbelievers",
        "It is permissible as long as it is done for Muslim martyrs and not for non-Muslim prominent figures",
        "It is recommended because it shows respect and honor to the deceased and their family",
        "It is obligatory when mourning for scholars and righteous people who served the Muslim community"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Standing in silence for a moment as a salute to martyrs or prominent figures is a reprehensable innovation that was not done at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his Companions, or the righteous earlier generations. It is not in accordance with the etiquette of Tawheed and is done by some Muslims following the invention of disbelievers and imitating their customs. The Prophet forbade imitating them. The Islamic custom is to pray for the dead, give charity on their behalf, and mention their good qualities while refraining from speaking of their bad qualities. The Standing Committee stated this practice is contrary to the principles of Islam."

      "question": "What is the ruling on wiping over medical socks for varicose veins that do not cover the toes?",
      "options": [
        "The socks do not qualify for wiping because they don't cover the required area (toes to ankles); if needed, wear them over proper wudu then put regular socks on top to wipe over",
        "It is permissible to wipe over them as long as they cover at least half of the foot from the ankle upward",
        "Wiping is valid because the medical necessity of wearing them makes them equivalent to plaster casts",
        "It is permissible to wipe over them only if the person intends to keep them on for the entire day without removal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The socks described do not come under the ruling on wiping over the khuffayn because they do not cover the place that must be washed (from the ends of the toes to the ankles). The correct approach is: if the sick person needs to wear them, do wudu before putting them on, then put over them socks that cover properly, and wipe over the covering socks. If taking off the medical sock will cause harm or delay recovery, it comes under the ruling of plaster casts - wipe over the entire thing (top and bottom) and wash the uncovered part of the foot. This is different from khuffayn where only the top is wiped."

      "question": "According to the majority of scholars, what is the ruling on planting trees in the mosque?",
      "options": [
        "It is makrooh or haraam because the mosque was built for remembrance of Allah, not for planting, and trees may damage the mosque and prevent worshippers from praying",
        "It is recommended because trees provide shade for worshippers and beautify the mosque environment",
        "It is permissible only if the trees are fruit-bearing so that the fruits can be sold to benefit the mosque",
        "It is obligatory in hot climates to provide natural cooling and create a peaceful atmosphere for prayer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The majority of fuqaha view it as makrooh to plant trees in the mosque, and some say it is haraam. The reasons include: the mosque was not built for planting but for the remembrance of Allah, prayer, and reading Quran; the tree may damage the mosque and prevent worshippers from praying in that spot; leaves and fruits will fall in the mosque; birds will come and defecate; children may throw stones at it. Some scholars also mentioned it makes the mosque similar to synagogues of the Jews. However, if there were plants on the land before the mosque was built and the mosque is built around it, there is nothing wrong with that."

      "question": "What is the condition for permissibility when buying from a company that sells cars by installments?",
      "options": [
        "The product must be owned by the company and in their possession before they sell it to the customer",
        "The company must charge no more than 5% interest on the installment payments",
        "The customer must pay at least half the price upfront before taking possession of the car",
        "The contract must be signed and registered before the company purchases the car from the original dealer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "There is nothing wrong with buying from installment companies if the product is owned by the company and in their possession. The company can then sell it for a certain price, with payments on the spot or later in installments. However, this must be after the company takes possession of the car. The buyer may describe the kind of car he wants, then the company can buy it and take possession of it, then sell it to him or someone else. The one who wants to buy is not under any obligation until the sale transaction is done after the company has acquired the item in question."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on tethering animals for the purpose of fattening them?",
      "options": [
        "It is permissible to tether animals if they are fed properly, as Muslims have always tethered animals and the Prophet tethered Buraq and instructed hobbling camels",
        "It is prohibited because tethering prevents the animal from moving freely and causes leg swelling",
        "It is only permissible for short periods not exceeding 24 hours, after which the animal must be released to graze",
        "It is forbidden unless the animal is given twice the normal amount of food to compensate for lack of movement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "There is nothing wrong with tethering animals if they are fed, and tethering them is not regarded as torturing them. The Muslims have always tethered their animals to protect them without anyone criticizing them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) tethered Buraq, and instructed hobbling camels. The hadith about the cat shows that if animals are detained AND fed, there is nothing wrong. Tethering does not harm the animal - it can drive away flies with its tail and scratch on walls around it. However, if someone ties the rope too tightly causing harm, he should loosen it to avoid harming the animal."

      "question": "What must parents do if they gave a gift (such as a car) to one of their children but not the others?",
      "options": [
        "They must take back the gift or give similar gifts to the other children, and if they die before doing so, the gift should be returned to the estate unless all heirs agree to it",
        "They may keep the gift with the one child if he was more obedient and dutiful to his parents than the others",
        "They must document the gift in their will so that other children receive equivalent monetary compensation after the parents' death",
        "They should allow the favored child to keep the gift but must publicly explain their reasons to prevent family disputes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Parents must treat their children equally with regard to giving and it is not permissible to favor one over another, even if the favored one is dutiful. If a parent gave a gift to one child, they must take it back during their lifetime or give the others something similar. If they die before that, and the children agree to the gift, it is valid; but if they do not agree, it should be returned to the estate and inherited along with the rest of the wealth. The son who received the car has no choice but to put it with the estate or work out its value, keep it, and deduct its value from his share of the estate."

      "question": "When is it obligatory to say 'Allahumma barik' (O Allah, bless it) upon seeing something you admire?",
      "options": [
        "It is obligatory when you admire something greatly and fear you could harm your brother with the evil eye, to ward off that harm",
        "It is obligatory every single time you see anything beautiful or admirable, whether it belongs to a Muslim or non-Muslim",
        "It is never obligatory but only recommended as a way of showing kindness to fellow Muslims",
        "It is obligatory only when seeing wealth or property, but not when seeing people or natural beauty"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "According to the scholars, there are two scenarios: (1) If the seer admires something greatly to the extent that he fears he could harm his brother with the evil eye, then it is obligatory to pray for barakah because the Muslim is required to ward off evil and harm from his brothers. Ibn al-Qayyim stated that if one fears causing harm by the evil eye, he may ward off its evil by saying 'Allahumma barik alayhi.' Ibn Abd al-Barr stated this is required of everyone who admires a thing. (2) If one is not known to have an evil eye and does not fear causing harm, it is still prescribed to pray for barakah as part of showing kindness, but scholars have not said it is obligatory in this situation."
