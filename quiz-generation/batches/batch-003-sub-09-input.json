There is an element of exaggeration in giving this name to a person.</p>\n<p>2.It is a name which is well known among the Christians, and it is (Arab) Christians who pronounce the word malak as Malaak.

Rather Anas ibn Maalik said: We were with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) – meaning during the Farewell Pilgrimage – and among us were some who recited “Allaahu akbar”, some who recited “Laa ilaaha     ill-Allaah”, and some who recited the Talbiyah. This is what is prescribed for the Muslims: for each person to recite the Talbiyah by himself, and     not to pay attention to what others are reciting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Did the Prophet appoint ‘Ali as khaleefah?",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on people who claim that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) as khaleefah, and say that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) conspired against him?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    This opinion is not known among any of the Muslim groups     apart from the Shi’ah, and it is a false view which has no basis in the     ahaadeeth that have been proven from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him). On the contrary, a great deal of evidence     shows that the khaleefah after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him     and with all the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him)). But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) did not state that clearly and he did not appoint him in any     definitive sense; rather he gave commands which indicated that, when he told     him to lead the people in prayer when he (the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him)) was sick, and when he told him about the     leadership of the Muslim community after his death, saying, “Allaah and the     believers will only accept Abu Bakr.” Hence the Sahaabah (may Allaah be     pleased with them) gave their allegiance (bay’ah) to Abu Bakr and they were     unanimously agreed that Abu Bakr was the best among them. It was reported in     the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Sahaabah     (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to say during the Prophet’s life:     “The best of this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then     ‘Uthmaan,” and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     approved of their saying that. Mutawaatir reports from ‘Ali (may Allaah be     pleased with him) show that he used to say, “The best of this ummah after     its Prophet is Abu Bakr then ‘Umar.” And he (may Allaah be pleased with him)     used to say, “No one is brought to me who prefers me over them, but I will     whip him with the hadd punishment for telling lies.” He never claimed that     he was the best of this ummah, or that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had appointed him as khaleefah. He     never said that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) had wronged     him and taken away his rights. When Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with     her) died he gave a second pledge of allegiance (bay’ah) to Abu Bakr, as     confirmation of his first pledge and to demonstrate to the people that he     was with the jamaa’ah (the main group of Muslims) and that he had no     reservations in his heart against giving his allegiance to Abu Bakr (may     Allaah be pleased with them all). When ‘Umar was stabbed, he appointed six     of those whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     had testified were guaranteed Paradise, for them to appoint one of their     number as ‘Umar’s successor; among these six was ‘Ali, who never denounced     ‘Umar, either whilst he was still alive or after his death. ‘Ali did not say     that he was more entitled than any of them to be khaleefah, so how can     anyone have the right to tell lies about the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and say that he appointed ‘Ali as     khaleefah? ‘Ali himself never made any such claim, and none of the Sahaabah     claimed that for him. Rather they were unanimously agreed that the caliphate     of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan was valid; ‘Ali acknowledged that and he     cooperated with all of them in jihad, shoora (consultation), etc. Moreover,     the Muslims after the Sahaabah were agreed upon that which the Sahaabah had     been agreed on. After all this, it is not permissible for anyone or for any     group, Shi’ah or others, to claim that ‘Ali was the appointed successor, or     that the caliphate before him was false. Similarly, no one has the right to     say that the Sahaabah wronged ‘Ali and took away his rights. Rather this is     the falsest of falsehoods, and it is thinking badly of the Companions of the     Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),     including ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him and with them all).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has protected the ummah of Muhammad  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) and kept it from agreeing on misguidance.     It was narrated in a saheeh report in many ahaadeeth that the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will     continue to adhere to the truth and to prevail.” It is impossible that the     noblest generation of this ummah could agree on falsehood, supposedly the     caliphate of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan. No one says this who believes in     Allaah and the Last Day, and no one says this who has the slightest insight     into the rulings of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Bismillahir rahmaanir raheem, asalaamu<br />\n      'alaykum, please answer, this is very important:<br />Does Allah's day equal to 1,000 human years (Sura 22:47, 32:5) or 50,000<br />\n      human years (Sura 70:4) Jazakallaahu khayr.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti said in his book Daf    Ayhaam al-Idtiraab an Aayaat al-Kitaab (p. 158):</p>\n<p>The aayah (interpretation of the meaning) And,    verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon [al-Hajj    22:47] indicates that the length of a day with Allaah is a thousand years. The same is    indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) He arranges (every) affair    from the heavens to the earth, then it (the affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the    space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning. [al-Sajdah 32:5]. Another    aayah indicates something different (interpretation of the meaning): The angels    and the Rooh [Jibreel] ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand    years [al-Maaarij 70:4].</p>\n<p>There are two ways in which these aayaat may be reconciled:</p>\n<p>The first was reported by Ibn Abi Haatim via Sammaak from Ikrimah    from Ibn Abbaas: the day of a thousand years mentioned in Soorat al-Hajj is one of    the six days in which Allaah created the heavens and the earth; the day of a thousand    years mentioned in Soorat al-Sajdah is the length of time it takes for a matter to go up    to Allaah; and the day of fifty thousand years is the Day of Resurrection.</p>\n<p>The second (way of reconciling the aayaat) is that what is meant by all    of them is the Day of Resurrection, and the difference in the time span depends on whether    a person is a believer or a kaafir. This is indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the    meaning): Truly that Day will be a Hard Day, far from easy for the    disbelievers. [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10]. These two suggestions were mentioned by    the author of al-Itqaan. And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She has committed sin and wants to repent",
      "question": "<p>I am married and my husband treats me very well. I got to know a girl at work and I did not have any other friend apart from her because I live in the West. I got very attached to her to the extent that she led me to engage in lesbianism. I regret it and after every prayer I ask Allah to accept my repentance. Even though my husband satisfies my sexual desire, I grow weak every time and go to her. My husband does not know about this. In order to punish myself I wanted to tell him, but I look at him and I cannot do it. I have not given up prayer, in the hope that my Lord will guide me. I am very aware of my sin and I weep a great deal in hope that my Lord will forgive me. But I return to the sin. I was pregnant and had a miscarriage, and I know that this is because Allah is angry with me. Please help me. I want to resolve not to go back to it. Is there any forgiveness for me? Is there any hadd punishment due on me? Is my prayer acceptable?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We ask Allah to guide you and accept your repentance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We advise you not to tell your husband about this matter and     strive to repent from it and give it up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Always bear in mind that Allah is watching you and can see     what you are doing at all times. This is most likely to make you feel shy     before Him and venerate Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You should always remember death and the Hereafter and the     Reckoning. If a person remembers death a great deal he will inevitably     prepare for it by doing righteous deeds and repenting from sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Cut off all ties with this girl immediately. If you can move     from that job, that is essential. Continuing the relationship between you     means that there is no repentance and that the sin will continue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Rather we tell you: if you can move from that city     altogether, then do that and do not hesitate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no remedy for this disease except keeping away from     that girl altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for your prayer being accepted, that is up to Allah, but     be wary of giving up prayer; rather you should strive to do a great deal of     it and to read Qur'aan, in the hope that this may be a means of Allah     accepting your repentance and guiding you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Listen to lectures and exhortations by well-known scholars     and daa’iyahs who are known for their trustworthiness, religious commitment,     sincerity and knowledge. Think about how Allah is forbearing towards you.     How can He be forbearing when you are persisting in disobeying Him? If He so     willed, He could punish you for this sin and you would have a bad end. Think     about how Allah has concealed your sin. What would you do if your husband     and other people found out what you are doing; it would be a big scandal.     How would your life be after that? So hasten to repent before Allah hastens     your death or punishment, in which case regret would be to no avail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The gate of repentance is open and Allah accepts the     repentant slave and rejoices over him; He forgives him and accepts his     repentance no matter what his sin. The one who repent from sin is like one who did not sin at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah to guide you.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Sponsoring or caring for orphans is a beneficial righteous deed. Concerning the virtues of this action, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be like this in Paradise” – and he gestured with his forefinger and middle finger, holding them apart slightly. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5304) and Muslim (2983).</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: “The one who sponsors an orphan” is the one who takes care of his affairs, spending on him, clothing him, disciplining him, educating him and so on.

Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in Al-Jawab As-Sahih liman baddala Din Al-Masih, 5/200):</p>\n<p>There is no difference of opinion between the Muslims and the People of the Book concerning the fact that Paran is Makkah. But if they say that it is not Makkah, there is nothing strange in that, because they are known for their distortions and fabrications.</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said concerning the region around Mount Hira’ in Makkah:</p>\n<p>That place is called Faran (Paran) to this day. (End quote)</p>\n<p>Abdul Haqq Vidyarthi (d. 1978 CE) stated in his famous book Muhammad in World Scriptures:</p>\n<p>In the Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch (Torah), which was published in 1851 CE, it says that Paran is located in the Hijaz, as follows:</p>\n<p>“And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 21:21).</p>\n<p>This translation remained in circulation for a long time, but when the Muslims alerted the Christian world to this prophecy, and that it constituted testimony to the truth of this Noble Prophet, the translation was changed. End quote</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Old Testament, in Psalms 84:5-6, 10, there is mention of the valley of Baca. This passage, in the King James Version (KJV), reads as follows:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5&nbsp;Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>\n<p>6&nbsp;Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>10&nbsp;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand (elsewhere).</p>\n<p>There is no valley on earth called Baca (or Bakkah) that contains a house of worship and a spring of water (Zamzam), in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, other than Makkah Al-Mukarramah.</p>\n<p>Baca (Bakkah) is one of the names of Makkah. This name is mentioned in the Glorious Quran, where Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning)”</p>\n<p>{Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-`Alamin (the mankind and jinns).} [Al `Imran 3:96]</p>\n<p>But the translators and commentators of the Old Testament distorted the word Baca to buka’ [weeping or crying; the Hebrew cognate denotes the same meaning], even though the meanings of place names should not be translated; rather the name should be transliterated, and even though the meaning of the (original) name has nothing to do with crying or weeping, as a result of their desire to eliminate all references to anything that is proven in the Glorious Quran, such distortions occurred.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we say:</p>\n<p>Even if nothing was mentioned in the Old Testament concerning Ibrahim’s journey to the Hijaz, that does not indicate that this journey did not happen at all.</p>\n<p>The well-known academic principle says that the fact that a thing is not mentioned does not mean that it did not happen. In other words, denying that something happened should take the form of a negative statement.</p>\n<p>The fact that no mention is made of its happening does not necessarily mean that it did not happen; rather the reason why it was not mentioned may be that it was omitted, forgotten, summarized in brief, and the like.</p>\n<p>If you find news of something in one newspaper, then you find that it is not mentioned at all in another newspaper, the fact that it is not mentioned in the latter does not mean that it did not happen. Whoever thinks in such terms is lacking in reason and is making no sense.</p>\n<p>This is also applicable in the case under discussion here.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we were to quote the words of non-Muslims who have investigated the story of the Ka`bah and who really built it, and have determined that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is the one who built it, this article would become far too long. But we will limit ourselves to quoting one of the most famous of contemporary history books, The Story of Civilization, by Will Durant. This book is composed of forty-two volumes in which the author discusses the history of most civilizations, including the history of the Arabian Peninsula, concerning which he says: “It (the Ka`bah) was built the fourth time by Abraham and Ishmael, his son from Hagar.

Allaah says concerning the one           who sits with those who are speaking of kufr and falsehood:&nbsp; </p>\n<p>“then           sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that” </p>\n<p>[al-Nisaa’           4:140 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>al-Tabari           said: this aayah clearly indicates that it is not allowed to sit with           the people of falsehood of any kind, when they are indulging in their           falsehood. “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case           you would be like them” [al-Nisaa’ 4:140 – interpretation of the meaning].           Ibn Katheer said: i.e., you would be like them in sinning.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>According           to a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir, the Prophet                     (pecace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes           in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is           being served.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Adab, 2725; classed           as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2246). The           commentator on the hadeeth said: even if he does not drink with them,           it is as if he is approving of their evil action.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>So it is not permissible to sit with them or to converse           with them, even if one does not drink, because if he does that he is           like a silent shaytaan (devil).</p>\n<p>If you see them, then           you have to denounce them for that, and if they do not respond then           leave them and keep away from them.

But whilst she is still married, custody belongs to both spouses.”</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah&nbsp;(17/301): “Custody of the child belongs to both parents, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/314574\" target=\"_blank\">if they are still married</a> . If they separate, then custody belongs to the mother, according to scholarly consensus.”</p>\n<p>The mother has more right to custody of her children until the age of seven, so long as she has not remarried, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (6707) and Abu Dawud (2276) from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A woman said: O Messenger of Allah, my womb was a vessel for this son of mine, my breast gave him to drink, and my lap was a protection for him. But now his father has divorced me and wants to take him away from me. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You have more right to him so long as you do not remarry.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Abu Dawud.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Who_gets_child_custody_after_a_mother39s_marriage\">Who gets child custody after a mother's marriage?</span></h3>\n<p>If she (the mother) remarries, custody passes to the next in line. However, there was a difference of opinion among the jurists concerning that:</p>\n<p>Some of them are of the opinion that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/171456\" target=\"_blank\">it passes to the mother’s mother</a> . This is the view of the majority in the four Madhhabs.</p>\n<p>Others are of the opinion that it passes to the father. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them). (See:&nbsp;Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah,&nbsp;17/302) and&nbsp;Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti‘,&nbsp;13/535)</p>\n<p>If we say that custody transfers to the child’s father, then if he allows the child to remain with his mother who has remarried, and she is suitable for the responsibility of custody, and her second husband agrees: then there is no objection.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the mother’s mother may give up custody to her daughter who has remarried.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Custody is the right of the one who can take care of the child, but it is not a duty.</p>\n<p>Based on that, if he or she wants to give up custody to the next in line, it is permissible for him or her to do that.\" (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`,&nbsp; 13/536)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Who_gets_child_custody_after_reaching_the_age_of_seven\">Who gets child custody after reaching the age of seven?</span></h3>\n<p>If the woman has not remarried and the child reaches the age of seven years,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the child is male, he is given the choice between his father and his mother, and he will live with the one whom he chooses, because of the report narrated by An-Nasa’i (3496) and Abu Dawud (2277) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard a woman who came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when I was sitting with him and said: O Messenger of Allah, my husband wants to take my son away even though he brings me water from the well of Abu `Inabah and is of benefit to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Draw lots for him.”</p>\n<p>Her husband said: Who is disputing my right to my child?</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said [to the child]: “This is your father and this is your mother; take the hand of whichever of them you wish.”</p>\n<p>And the child took the hand of his mother, and she took him away.<br>This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Abu Dawud.</p>\n<p>This is the view of the Hanbalis and Shafi`is (may Allah have mercy on them).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the child is female, she may also be given the choice, according to Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The mother has more right to her until the girl gets married or begins to menstruate.”</p>\n<p>Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The mother has more right to her until she gets married and the husband consummates the marriage with her.”</p>\n<p>Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The father has more right to her, because the father has more right to ensure her wellbeing.” (See:&nbsp;Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah,&nbsp;17/314-317)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"When_does_child_custody_end\">When does child custody end?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/91862\" target=\"_blank\">Child custody</a> ends when the child reaches puberty and the age of maturity, at which time he may choose whichever he wishes of his parents. The child also has the right to live separately from them if he is male.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: No one is entitled to custody over anyone else except a child or one who has an intellectual disability. As for one who is an adult of mature thinking, there is no need for custody of him, and he has the choice to live with whichever of his parents he wishes.</p>\n<p>If he is a male, then he has the right to live alone, because he has no need of them, but it is recommended for him not to live apart from them so that he will not stop honouring them.</p>\n<p>If the child is female, she cannot live on her own, and her father should prevent her from doing that, because there is no certainty that someone may come to her and corrupt her, thus bringing shame upon her and her family. If she does not have a father, then her guardian and her family should prevent her from doing that.\"(Al-Mughni&nbsp; 8/191).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Who_spends_on_a_child_during_custody\">Who spends on a child during custody?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/264146\" target=\"_blank\">Spending on the children’s maintenance</a> during custody is the duty of the father.</p>\n<p>After the custody ends, when the children reach puberty and become mature, then there is a difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the duty of spending on their maintenance.</p>\n<p>If an adult son is poor, then his rich father is obliged to spend on him. If there is no father, then his rich mother must spend on him, according to the Hanbalis, whether he is healthy or incapacitated.</p>\n<p>According to the Shafi`is, that becomes obligatory if the child is incapacitated due to a chronic condition or illness.</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;Al-Insaf&nbsp;(9/289): “The words “and his children, no matter how far the line of descent reaches” also include adult children who are healthy and strong, if they are poor. This is correct, and it is the view of the Madhhab.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ash-Shafi`i said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There should be a condition that there is something wrong with him, either in terms of discernment or physically.</p>\n<p>Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The father should spend on the boy until he reaches puberty, then if he reaches puberty and is healthy, the duty to spend on him ceases, but the duty to spend on a daughter is not waived until she gets married.”</p>\n<p>Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said something similar, except that he said that spending on daughters should continue until they get married and their husbands consummate the marriage with them, then there is no spending on them even if they get divorced. But if they get divorced before consummation of the marriage, then [the father] should still spend on them.</p>\n<p>We also have the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Hind: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children on a reasonable basis.” He did not exempt the child who is mature and healthy, and because the child is poor, he deserves maintenance from his rich father, just as is the case if the child is chronically ill or blind.\" (Al-Mughni&nbsp; 9/258)</p>\n<p>From this we may learn that so long as the father is alive, the woman does not have to spend on her children after custody ends, whether that is to buy a house or anything else, and that the father is required to spend on his daughter until she gets married.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following category: <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/51/\" target=\"_blank\">Custody</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
