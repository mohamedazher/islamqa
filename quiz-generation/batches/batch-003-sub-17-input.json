      "title": "Is there any saheeh report that says the du‘aa’ of a pregnant woman will be answered?",
      "question": "<p>Is it true that the Duaa of a Pregnant woman is accepted.<br />\nI would really appreciate if this can be clarified. Also, I would like to know if there are any specific good deeds that I can do while I am pregnant.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    After researching the matter, we have not found anything to     indicate that the du‘aa’ of a pregnant woman will be answered, either in the     marfoo‘ hadeeths (those that are attributed to the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him)) or in mawqoof reports (those that are     attributed to the Sahaabah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the Muslim combines positive thinking about Allah, may     He be exalted, and certainty of His generosity with proper humility before     Him, then we hope that Allah will answer his du ‘aa’s and fulfil his hopes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It remains for us to note that the du‘aa’ of the mother for     her child is one of the du‘aa’s that will be answered, because the Prophet     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three du‘aa’s     that will undoubtedly be answered: the du‘aa’ of one who has been wronged,     the du‘aa’ of the traveller and the du‘aa’ of a father&nbsp; for his child.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1905). See also Saheeh al-Adab     al-Mufrad, 372&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “The du‘aa’ of the father for his child” is because he is     truly compassionate towards him and often prefers him to himself. As his     compassion is genuine, then his du‘aa’ will be answered. The mother is not     mentioned even though the emphasis on her rights may indicate that her du‘aa’     is more likely to be answered than that of the father, because this is     something that is well known. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fayd al-Qadeer, 3/301&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a pregnant woman prays for her baby to be righteous, smart     and of good character, then we hope that Allah will answer her prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please see also the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/13506\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">13506</a> for a discussion on the     conditions of du‘aa’ being answered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Rules of `Iddah for Widows",
      "question": "<p>My husband died a short while ago, and I am now in the `Iddah period, adhering to what is required during this time. A few days ago I spoke to the mother of one of my friends, and she said that for them in Turkey, the matter is somewhat different with regard to the woman in `Iddah, and that the only thing she must refrain from is getting married, and nothing else; as for other matters, such as putting on perfume, adorning herself, or going out for necessary purposes, they do not see anything wrong with that. She attributed this to the Hanafi Madhhab that the people in that country follow. Is what she said correct? Is there a difference of opinion among the jurists of the four Madhhabs concerning the `Iddah of a recently-widowed woman? I would like to know these details, not only for myself, but so that I can offer advice to that woman.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What this woman has told you, and attributed it to the Hanafi Madhhab (school of jurisprudence) – that the<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10670\" target=\"_blank\"> recently-widowed woman</a> only has to refrain from remarrying, and that anything other than that, such as adorning herself, is permissible for her and there is no blame on her if she does it – is not correct. The Hanafi jurists have stated that the recently-widowed woman must refrain from adorning herself.</p>\n<p>As-Samarqandi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Fuqaha’ (2/251): “Explanation of mourning: it means avoiding everything that women adorn themselves with, such as putting on perfume, wearing clothing that has been dyed with safflower or saffron, putting kohl on their eyes, using skin creams, combing their hair, wearing jewellery, dyeing their hair, and so on.”</p>\n<p>In Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq (3/34) by Az-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him), it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The recently-widowed woman observes mourning by refraining from adornment, perfume, kohl, skin cream (unless she has a legitimate excuse to use it), henna, and clothes dyed with safflower and saffron, if she is an adult and Muslim. That is because of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for someone who has died, except in the case of a husband, in which case <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/81139\" target=\"_blank\">she should observe mourning for him for four months and ten days</a> ; she should not wear kohl, or wear any dyed garment except `Asb (an unattractive Yemeni garment), or use perfume except when she purifies herself [following menses], a little Qust or Azfar [types of perfume].” &nbsp;(Al-Bukhari and Muslim).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: “The woman whose husband has died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower, or jewellery, or dye her hair, or use kohl.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i)</p>\n<p>The Hanafi jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) regard it as permissible <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/101546\" target=\"_blank\">for the recently-widowed woman to go out during the day if there is a need for her to go out</a> , such as earning a living, seeking medical treatment, and the like, on condition that she go home at night and spend the night at home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq wa Minhat Al-Khaliq (4/166):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/127974\" target=\"_blank\">The recently-widowed woman may go out</a> during the day and part of the night in order to earn a living… But it is not permissible for her to go out to visit other people or for any other purpose, whether by night or by day.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the only reason for which she is allowed to go out is if she has a need to in order to attend to her business or errands; once she does what she needs to, it is not permissible for her after that to spend time outside her house.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Kasaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the recently-widowed woman, she should not go out at night, but there is nothing wrong with her going out during the day to attend to her errands, such as if she needs to go out during the day to earn enough to cover her expenses, because she has no maintenance from her deceased husband; rather she is responsible for her own maintenance, so she needs to go out in order to earn that money. However, she should not go out at night, because there is no need for her to go out at night. This is in contrast to the recently-divorced woman, whose ex-husband is responsible for her maintenance, and thus she has no need to go out.\" (Bada’i` As-Sana’i` fi Tartib Ash-Shara’i`, 3/205)</p>\n<p>With regard to staying in the house and avoiding adornment during the `Iddah period, there is virtual consensus among the four Madhhabs.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Maalikis, Ibn `Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Kafi fi Fiqh Ahl Al-Madinah (2/622): “Mourning is obligatory for the one whose husband has died, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/31\" target=\"_blank\">until her `Iddah is complete</a> , either in terms of the requisite number of months or when her pregnancy ends.</p>\n<p>Mourning means <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/286707\" target=\"_blank\">avoiding everything with which women adorn themselves</a> , such as jewellery, cosmetics, kohl, dyeing the hair, or coloured or white garments worn for the purpose of adornment. ... As for jewellery, rings and so on, it is not permissible for the woman who is in mourning to wear them. The same applies to all kinds of perfume. If she has no choice but to use kohl, she should apply it at night and remove it during the day. She should not use any kind of perfumed oils. As for things that are not used for the purpose of beautification, there is nothing wrong with the woman who is in mourning using them.”</p>\n<p>In the case of the Shafa`is, Abu Ishaq Ash-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Tanbih fil Fiqh Ash-Shafa`i (1/201): “Mourning means avoiding adornment. So she (the woman who is in mourning) should not wear jewellery, put on perfume, dye her hair, style her hair, or use kohl made of antimony. If she needs to use kohl, she should apply it at night and wash it off during the day. She should not wear red or bright blue clothes. She should not go out of her house unnecessarily, and if there is a need for her to go out, it is not permissible to do that at night. It is permissible for the recently-widowed woman to go out to meet her needs during the day.”</p>\n<p>In the case of the Hanbalis, Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in `Umdat Al-Fiqh (1/107): Chapter on Mourning: “It (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13966\" target=\"_blank\">mourning</a> ) is obligatory for the woman whose husband has died, and it means avoiding adornment, perfume, kohl made of antimony, and the wearing of dyed clothes for the purpose of beautification .… She should stay at night in her house in which she is obliged to observe `Iddah and where she is living, if possible.”</p>\n<p>For more details, please see this category: <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/53/\" target=\"_blank\">Waiting Period of Widow or Divorcee</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam: When Can Women Pray and Fast?",
      "question": "<p>My wife gave birth around the 15th of Sha<span>ط</span>ban. Is it permissible for her to pray, fast, do ‘umrah, read Quran and do all other duties prescribed in Islam when the nifas (post-partum bleeding) stops and she is sure of that, or should she wait for 40 days as some people say?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Is_there_a_minimum_length_of_nifas_in_Islam\">Is there a minimum length of nifas in Islam?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Can_women_pray_and_fast_if_blood_stops_before_40_days_of_nifas\">Can women pray and fast if blood stops before 40 days of nifas?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_there_a_minimum_length_of_nifas_in_Islam\">Is there a minimum length of nifas in Islam?</span></h3>\n<p>The majority of scholars, including the four imams, are of the view that there is no minimum limit for nifas. Whenever a woman becomes pure from nifas, she has to do ghusl and pray and fast, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/140621\" target=\"_blank\">even if that is before forty days have passed since the birth</a> . Because no precise definition has been narrated in the Shari`ah with regard to the minimum length of nifas, so the matter should be based on experience, which shows that nifas may be very short or it may be long. (Ibn Qudamah in al-Mughni, 1/428)</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars narrated that there was consensus on this point. Al-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Successors and those who came after them are agreed that a woman in nifas should stop praying for forty days, unless she sees that she has become pure before that, in which case she should do ghusl and pray.” (Al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 2/541)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_women_pray_and_fast_if_blood_stops_before_40_days_of_nifas\"><strong>Can women pray and fast if blood stops before 40 days of nifas?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/195) was asked: is it permissible for a woman in nifas to pray, fast and do Hajj before forty days if she becomes pure (i.e., if the bleeding stops)?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Yes, it is permissible for her to fast, pray and do Hajj and ‘umrah, and it is permissible for her husband <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/43028\" target=\"_blank\">to have intercourse with her within forty days</a> , if she becomes pure. If she becomes pure after twenty days, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82868\" target=\"_blank\">she should do ghusl and pray and fast</a> , and she is permissible for her husband. The report from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-As which says that he regarded that as makruh is to be understood as meaning disliked but not forbidden; this is his ijtihad, but there is no evidence for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The correct view is that there is nothing wrong with that if the woman becomes pure before forty days. If the bleeding resumes within forty days, then the correct view is that she should regard it as nifas within the 40-day period, but her fasts, prayers and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21618\" target=\"_blank\">Hajj</a> at the time when she was pure are still valid and she does not have to repeat any of them, so long as they were done when she was pure.”</p>\n<p>It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (5/458):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If a woman in nifas sees that she has become pure before 40 days are over, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82344\" target=\"_blank\">then she should do ghusl</a> and pray and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/157006\" target=\"_blank\">fast</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36722\" target=\"_blank\">her husband may have intercourse with her</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee (10/155) was asked about a woman who gave birth seven days before Ramadan, then she became pure and fasted Ramadan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If the matter is as described and she fasted Ramadan at a time when she was pure, then her fast is valid and she does not have to make it up.”</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best</p>\n",

I will certainly recognize some of you who meet Allah carrying     a camel that is groaning or a cow that is lowing or a sheep that is     bleating.” Then he raised his hand until the whiteness of his armpit could     be seen and said: “O Allah, have I conveyed (the message)?” [al-Bukhari,     Muslim].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Who has enabled you to repent.

      "question": "<p>A woman started bleeding two days before she had a miscarriage, and that was in Ramadaan. She also bled for two days after the miscarriage. The foetus was two months old – should she make up the fasts or what should she do? Please note that she fasted and did not break her fast.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a woman miscarriages the     foetus when human features such as the head and limbs have not yet appeared,     and the outlines have not even appeared, the bleeding that occurs with that     is irregular vaginal bleeding, and it does not mean that she cannot pray and     fast. But if human features have appeared, then this bleeding is nifaas. The     earliest that the human features appear is eighty-one days (of pregnancy),     as is explained in the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/37784\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">37784</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/45564\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">45564</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the matter is as     described, that the age of the foetus was two months, then the bleeding that     occurred before and after the miscarriage was irregular bleeding, not     nifaas. So the woman’s fasting on those days was valid and she does not have     to make them up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is there any basis in sharee‘ah for turning over upside-down shoes? <br />\n<br />\nI am seeking reward from Allah when I do that <br />\nBecause people say “I am turning this shoe away from the Countenance of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.”<br />\n<br />\nThis is something that I have had the habit of doing since I was small.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    There is no such basis in sharee‘ah for turning over a shoe     that is upside down. Ibn ‘Aqeel al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him)     regarded going to extremes in that regard as the one of the actions of the     ignorant. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Woe to the scholar who does not strive his utmost against the     ignorant …One of them swears by the Mushaf for the sake of a grain, and he     strikes with the sword whomever he meets on the basis of tribal feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And they threaten the one who they see placing a loaf of     bread facedown or leaving an upside-down shoe with its sole pointed towards     the sky. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Adaab al-Shar‘iyyah,     1/268-269&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was     asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some people who say that if a shoe is placed upside     down, the angels will not enter that house or Allah will not look at that     house. What you say about this matter?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We say: That is not correct and I do not know of there being     anything wrong with a shoe being upside down. But this is a very serious     matter for some people. It may be very serious for some people but there is     no basis for it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Noor ‘ala al-Darb, 13/65&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with changing the position of the shoe     because the sole is usually dirty, so it is not good manners to leave it     (the sole) uppermost where people can see it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some old people say that it is not permissible to leave a     shoe upside down because it is facing towards the Face of Allah. Is this     true?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a shoe is left upside down, that is off-putting and     disliked, because its sole is usually in contact with the ground and the one     who wears the shoe steps on the ground with it, and he may step in something     dirty. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah,     26/302-303. </p>\n",

Neither of them are Muslim, although Alhumdulilah, they are accepting of my being<br />\n      Muslim.

      "answer": "<p>It is not obligatory because no report to that effect has been    narrated, so we refer to the principle that all things are permitted except those which    have been expressly forbidden. As far as a mahram ( a relative whom one is permanently    forbidden to marry  this includes the mothers husband) for travelling is    concerned, one of the conditions is that he should be a Muslim.
