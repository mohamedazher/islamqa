      "answer": "<p>This insinuating whisper will not have any effect on him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that the Shaytaan comes to a person and says to him “Who created such and such? Who created such and such?” until he says, “Who created Allah?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us of the best medicine for dealing with that, which is to seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan and to put a stop to that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So if any such thing occurs to you or crosses your mind, say “A’oodhu Billaahi min al-Shaytaan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan)” and give up this thought and ignore it completely. Then it will go away by Allaah’s Leave.&nbsp;</p>\n",

The breeze came and lifted the edge of the curtain, uncovering the “daughters” of `A’ishah, i.e., her dolls. He said: “What is this, O `A’ishah?” She said: “My daughters.” And among them he saw a horse with two wings of cloth. He said: “What is this that I see among them?” She said: “A horse.” He said: “What is this on it?” She said: “Two wings.” He said: “A horse with wings?” She said: “Have you not heard that Sulayman had horses with wings?” She said: \"He smiled so broadly that I could see his eye teeth.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4932; classed as authentic by Al-`Iraqi in Takhrij Al-Ihya’, 2/344 and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)</p>\n<p>Al-Hafidh ibn Hajr said in Fat-h Al-Bari (10/527):</p>\n<p>This Hadith is taken as evidence that it is permissible to have dolls and toys for girls to play with.

It is most likely that they do not come under that ruling.</p>\n<p>If they are not in the form of humans, then there is nothing wrong with watching them, so long as they are not accompanied by anything prohibited such as music and so on, and they do not distract from obligatory duties.\" (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 2/question 333)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Impact_of_Cartoons_on_Childrens_Education\">Impact of Cartoons on Children’s Education</span></h3>\n<p>The issue of animated drawings and cartoons is one of the most serious educational issues, because of the immense effect that these films have on children’s developing characters, and because they have become a primary educational tool in many countries nowadays.</p>\n<p>At this stage, the heart and mind of the child is like a blank page; nothing crosses it but it leaves an imprint.</p>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Mawdud (240):</p>\n<p>One thing that the child desperately needs is for care to be taken with regard to his morals and attitude, for he will grow up with whatever the one who is raising him accustoms him to when he is small, and when he grows older it becomes difficult for him to change what he has got used to; these attitudes and characteristics that have become deeply ingrained in him, even if he tries to suppress them, they will always surface and expose him. (End quote)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Positive_Aspects_of_Cartoons\">Positive Aspects of Cartoons</span></h3>\n<p>These are some of the positive effects of children watching these programs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">They give children a great deal of educational information in an easy and enjoyable manner. Some cartoons focus on particular geographical areas, and others focus on scientific matters, such as the parts of the human body, which gives the child advanced knowledge at an early age.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">They develop the child’s imagination and nourish his abilities, and they develop the imagination in a way which helps the mind to grow and prepare it to be innovative and teach the child new ways of thinking and behaving.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">They teach classical Arabic which children usually do not hear at home or even at school. It is well known that teaching the child correct language is one of the aims of education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Iqtida’ As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim (1/207):</p>\n<p>It should be noted that becoming accustomed to the language has a powerful effect on one's thinking, attitude and religious commitment, and also has the effect of seeking to follow the example of the early generations of this Ummah, the Companions and Successors of the Companions (Tabi`un). Seeking to follow their example increases reasoning, religious commitment and good attitude. Moreover, the Arabic language is part of this religion, and learning it is obligatory and essential. End quote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">They meet some psychological needs and have a beneficial effect, such as compassion, love, honouring one’s parents, competition, striving for success and meeting challenges and many other positive attitudes that can be instilled via cartoons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\"><span id=\"Negative_Aspects_of_Cartoons\">Negative Aspects of Cartoons</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">There are also some <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/112018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negative effects that come from watching these programs</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">The negative consequences of watching TV in general, of which there are many such as: damage to the eyes, getting used to laziness and inactivity, getting used to passive reception and not participating. It also stunts natural development of knowledge, because knowledge is acquired by learning and researching, but television replaces seeking with mere receiving. Watching TV also weakens the bonds of love between family members, when they let watching shows keep them from speaking to one another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing the parent’s responsibilities in raising the child in Tuhfat Al-Mawlud (241):</p>\n<p>He should avoid letting him become lazy and inactive, and should teach him the opposite. He should not let him rest for more than he needs to refresh his body and soul for more work, for laziness and inactivity bring bad consequences and will end in regret, but hard work brings good consequences, either in this world or in the Hereafter or in both. End quote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/192671/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">They present beliefs and ideas that are contrary to Islam</a>, as some movies include mixing and display of charms (Tabarruj) that are prohibited. Some cartoons, such as Tom &amp; Jerry, give distorted ideas about the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell, and the Reckoning. Some cartoons include distortions of the stories of the Prophets and Messengers, and some poke fun at Islam and Muslims, whilst others (such as <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pokemon</a>) include <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the beliefs of eastern and idolatrous religions</a>. And there are many other examples. Even if a film does not outwardly go against Islam, it still carries notions of western culture that are alien to our society and religion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dr. Wahbah Az-Zuhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Qadiyat Al-Ahdath (6):</p>\n<p>With regard to children’s programs and some adults’ programs, they propagate the spirit of western culture and promote western traditions, and they attract people to western-style parties and clubs.</p>\n<p>One of the effects of this culture is the adoption of imaginary examples instead of following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his companions, the scholars and the Mujahidun. So children start to imitate Superman, Batman and Spiderman and other imaginary characters who do not exist, and they lose out in following the real example, as they get confused by so many imaginary examples who have no faith. &nbsp;(Wasa’il Al-I`lam wal-Atfal: Wijhat nadhar Islamiyyah by Abul-Hasan Sadiq and the article entitled Athar Ar-Rusum Al-Mutaharrikah `ala Al-Atfal by Nizar Muhammad `Uthman)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Islamic_Stance_on_Cartoons_a_Balanced_Approach\">The Islamic Stance on Cartoons: a Balanced Approach</span></h3>\n<p>After stating the positive and negative aspects, the Islamic attitude should be clear in sha Allah. The more negative points there are, the closer the ruling is to stating that it is prohibited, and the more it is able to avoid the negative aspects, the closer it is to being permissible. This tells us that it is essential to establish companies that will produce Islamic cartoons by means of which all positive virtues may be instilled and all harmful and evil aspects can be avoided.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling concerning married muslim men who cheat on thier wives(physically or non physically) and what is the ruling concerning muslim women who knowingly have an affair with married men just for fun?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a man to form an illicit relationship with a non-mahram woman is not just cheating on his wife, it is also a sin and an act of disobedience towards his Lord. Allah has forbidden such relationships and has barred the ways that may lead to the greater form of immorality which is zina (unlawful sexual relationships), which is what is referred to in the question.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The forbidden acts which people commit when they have such relationships are many and include being alone with that person (khulwah), shaking hands with them, looking at them, etc. These are sins which are forbidden in the texts in and of themselves, and because of the sin of zina to which they may lead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a Muslim woman to form an illicit relationship with a man who is not her mahram – whether he is married or not – is also a major sin and is worse than what is mentioned in the first part of the question, because it results in mixing of lineages and it makes the husband doubt whether his children are really his or not, which leads to a great deal of mischief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There follow the fatwas of some of the scholars concerning something that is less serious than meetings between the sexes, so what about things that are more serious?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for any person to correspond with a woman who is not his mahram, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in that.&nbsp; The person who is sending these letters may think that there is no fitnah involved, but the Shaytaan will keep at him until he tempts the man by means of the woman and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded those who hear the Dajjaal to keep away from him, and he said that a man may come to him as a believer, but the Dajjaal will keep at him until he tempts him and leads him astray.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of temptation and danger in correspondence between young men and young women, so they must keep away from it, even&nbsp; though the questioner may say that there is no love involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/578&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah al-Jibreen said, when he was asked about corresponding with a non-mahram woman:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This action is not permissible, because it will provoke desire between them and will make them want to meet one another. This kind of correspondence often causes fitnah (temptation) and plants the seeds of zina in the heart, which leads to evil actions. So we advise those who are seeking that which is in their own best interests and who wish to protect themselves to avoid writing to or speaking with non-mahrams, etc., so as to protect their religious commitment and their honour, and Allah is the Source of help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/578, 579</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to put the sperm of the husband and the egg from the wife in the womb of the second wife?",
      "question": "<p>“Ahmad” has two wives, the first one cannot have children and the second one can have children, praise be to Allah. In the modern scientific age doctors can, by the grace of Allah, put an egg from the second wife with the husband’s sperm (test-tube baby) and mix them and let them start to grow, then place (the fertilized egg) in the womb of the wife who cannot have children, so that the child can grow until he is born. Is this permissible in the light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah? Some people say that it permissible by analogy with breastfeeding, i.e., just as it is permissible to nourish a child with her milk in her lap, it should also be permissible for her to nourish him with her blood in her womb.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This method of fertilization, which involves placing the egg with the husband’s sperm in the womb of the other wife, is a method that is not acceptable according to sharee’ah, and a large number of scholars are of the view that it is haraam. Statements were issued concerning it by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League. Those who initially said that this method was permissible later retracted their view. There follows some of what was said in those statements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The meeting of the Islamic Fiqh Council held on 8 – 13 Safar 1407 AH (11–16 October 1986).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After examining the subject of artificial fertilization –“test-tube babies” – by studying the research presented and listening to comments of experts and doctors, and after discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The methods of artificial fertilization that are known nowadays are seven:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in his wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>ii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm of a man other than the husband and the wife’s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>iii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, and the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to carry it (surrogate motherhood).</p>\n<p>iv.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of strangers, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>v.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.</p>\n<p>vi.Where sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, and fertilization occurs outside the womb, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>vii.Where sperm is taken from the husband and placed in the wife’s vagina or uterus so that fertilization may take place inside her body.</p>\n<p>It was determined that the first five methods are all haraam according to sharee’ah and are forbidden completely in and of themselves, or because of the results to which they will lead, such as mixing of lineages, loss of motherhood and other things that are forbidden according to sharee’ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the sixth and seventh methods, the committee thinks that there is nothing wrong with resorting to them in cases of need, after emphasizing that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majallat al-Majma’ (3/1/423).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 –Statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>and blessings and peace be upon our Master and Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session held at the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, from Saturday 18 Rabee’ al-Aakhir until Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985), examined the remarks submitted by some of its members concerning what the Council had declared permissible … with regard to artificial fertilization and test-tube babies, which was issued in its seventh session, held between 11-16 Rabee’ al-Aakhir 1404 AH, where it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the couple and, after fertilization in a laboratory vessel, the embryo is implanted in the womb of another wife of the same man, as she volunteers to carry this pregnancy of behalf of her co-wife whose womb has been removed – it seems to the committee that this is permissible in cases of need and subject to the general conditions mentioned previously.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The remarks may be summed up as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other wife in whose womb the embryo from the egg of the first wife is implanted may become pregnant with a second child before the embryo becomes established in her womb, as the result of relations with her husband around the time of the implanting of the embryo, then she may give birth to twins and it may not be known which child resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which resulted from relations with the husband, and it may not be known which wife is the mother of the child who resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which is the mother of the child who resulted from relations with the husband. Similarly, one of the two embryos may die at the ‘alaqah or mudghah stage but not be expelled from the uterus until the other child is born, and it may also not be known whether he is the child that resulted from the (implanted) embryo or from relations with the husband. This means that there is confusion as to who the real mother is and there is mixing of lineages which affects a number of rulings. All of this means that the Council must retract their rulings in the case mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Council has also listened to the opinions presented by doctors and obstetricians who attended the meeting and who pointed to the possibility of the other pregnancy being miscarried as the result of marital relations with the woman who is carrying the embryo, and confusion of lineages as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After a discussion of the matter and an exchange of opinions, the Council decided to retract the view that the third type mentioned is permissible, and in the seventh session, 1404 AH.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Qaraaraat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi (pp. 159-161).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to take the husband’s sperm and the wife’s egg and put the mixture in the womb of another wife of the husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I am wearing hejab for 1 year naw and my<br />\n      husband wants me to take it off and i think it will cause me problems with my husband if i<br />\n      dont what should i do</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>You have to persevere in obeying the command of Allaah and   not remove your hijaab, because there is no obedience to any created being if   it involves disobedience to the Creator. You should advise him and deal with   him kindly and gently, and seek the support of righteous people among your family   and his, if it comes to that. We also recommend you read the book \"Wasaail   Thabat\" (Ways to Steadfast Faith) published under the heading   Books on this web site. We ask Allaah to help you to be steadfast, and to guide   him (your husband).</p>\n",

      "title": "Is Life Insurance Halal in Islam?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to take out life insurance so as to ensure that my family will be provided for after I die? Please provide the evidence for your response.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about life insurance, and he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Insurance of one’s life or possessions is haram and is not permitted, because it involves gharar (buying/selling something where it is not known whether what is being bought/sold will actually be achieved/delivered, or in what specific quantity, thus putting one’s money at undue risk to being lost) and riba (usury, interest).</p>\n<p>Allah has forbidden all transactions that are based on riba, and all transactions which involve deceit, as a mercy to this ummah, and to protect them from that which may harm them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><strong>“…whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba”</strong> [al-Baqarah 2:275]</p>\n<p>And it was narrated in a sahih report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade deceit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more about life insurance issues, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/285340\" target=\"_blank\">285340</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69\" target=\"_blank\">69</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/285242\" target=\"_blank\">285242</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/294684\" target=\"_blank\">294684</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/184222\" target=\"_blank\">184222</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should a woman wear hijab in halaqas (study circles) so that the angels do not see her without hijab?",
      "question": "<p>It has become a common practice among women in study circles to wear hijab, on the grounds that the angels can see them, and that they should be modest in the presence of the angels. Is this view correct? What is the ruling on such views?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, when a woman attends women’s gatherings, she should be modest in her dress and polite in her speech, especially if it is a study circle, or it is in a school for teaching Qur’an and Islamic knowledge and the like.</p>\n<p>But it is not prescribed for women to observe hijab on the grounds that the angels can see them, and that the angels are to be regarded in the same manner as non-mahram men, or for them to do that by way of respect and modesty.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence to support this action or to support introducing any rules into the religion of Allah for which Allah has not given permission. If that were correct, then women should wear hijab at home too, because the angels could see her there too.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>Is it true that the angels will not attend women’s halaqahs if the women uncover their hair (i.e., they do not wear their hijab during the study circle)?</p>\n<p>He replied: I do not know of any basis for that. They may recite Qur’an and remember Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, even if they are bare-headed, so long as there is no non-mahram man present. That does not prevent the angels from entering.\" (<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp; 24/85).</p>\n<p>With regard to the Muslim woman sitting in study circles and Qur’an circles wearing modest clothing, being well-mannered in her speech and dignified in her actions, this is something praiseworthy and it is what she should adhere to, because being well mannered and paying attention to modesty in study circles and Qur’an circles is something that is prescribed and is encouraged.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is recommended for the one who recites Qur’an outside of prayer to face towards the qiblah and sit in a humble, calm and dignified manner, with his head lowered, and he should pay attention to proper etiquette in his manner of sitting, as he would when sitting before his teacher. This is the most perfect option, but if he recites standing or lying down on his bed, or in any other posture, that is permissible.\"&nbsp;(<em>Mukhtasar at-Tibyaan&nbsp;</em>p. 17).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
