      "question": "What is the proper way to erase forbidden images according to Islamic rulings?",
      "options": [
        "The facial features must be erased to make the image disappear",
        "Only the eyes need to be erased from the image",
        "The entire body must be erased, not just the face",
        "Any part of the image can be erased as long as something is removed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The image is the face, which must be erased so that the image disappears. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade striking the 'image,' and other ahadith clarified this means the face. Therefore, the facial features must be erased to properly remove a forbidden image."

      "question": "A wife's husband spends most of his time outside watching football, leaving her alone all day. What should she do according to Islamic guidance?",
      "options": [
        "She should not bring a TV due to its obvious bad effects, and instead find ways to make her husband want to stay home through kind treatment and common interests",
        "She should buy a TV so her husband stays home with her",
        "She should allow her husband to keep watching football outside since it may be permissible",
        "She should spend her free time watching TV herself since she is alone all day"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The answer advises against bringing a TV into the home because of its obvious bad effects. Instead, the wise wife should look for ways to make her husband want to stay home, such as treating him well, taking care of him, adorning herself, and looking for common interests. She should also make good use of her time in things that benefit her, such as memorizing Quran and attending halaqahs."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on using sleeping pills and relaxants to treat anxiety and insomnia?",
      "options": [
        "It is not permissible to use sleeping pills and relaxants except on the advice of a trustworthy doctor",
        "Self-medication with relaxants is permissible as long as they are available without prescription",
        "Using such medications will stop prayer from being accepted for 40 days",
        "Muscle relaxants are permissible to use regularly since they help with sleep and calmness"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "It is not permissible to use sleeping pills and relaxants except on the advice of a trustworthy doctor, because some of them can contain narcotics, some can cause addiction, and some do more harm than good. Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen stated it is not permissible to use these pills except in cases of necessity, on condition that they be recommended by a knowledgeable doctor, as they are dangerous and have an impact on brain function."

      "question": "What should you do when someone sneezes but does not say 'al-hamdu lillah' (praise be to Allah)?",
      "options": [
        "It is not prescribed to say 'Yarhamuk Allah' to him, nor to remind him to praise Allah",
        "You should remind him to say 'al-hamdu lillah' before responding with 'Yarhamuk Allah'",
        "You should say 'Yarhamuk Allah' even if he didn't praise Allah, then remind him afterward",
        "The Prophet would always remind those who sneezed but forgot to praise Allah"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "If someone sneezes and does not praise Allah, it is not prescribed to say 'Yarhamuk Allah' to him or to remind him to praise Allah. This is based on the authentic hadith where the Prophet said 'Yarhamuk Allah' to one of two men who sneezed but not to the other, explaining that one praised Allah and the other did not. If reminding was prescribed, the Prophet would have reminded the man who didn't praise Allah."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on reciting the beginning and end of Soorat al-Baqarah at the grave after burying the deceased?",
      "options": [
        "The hadith about reciting the beginning and end of Soorat al-Baqarah at the grave is very weak (da'eef jiddan) and not to be practiced",
        "This practice is confirmed as sunnah from the Prophet and should be done at every burial",
        "The saheeh practice is to recite al-Faatihah and the beginning and end of Soorat al-Baqarah at the head of the grave",
        "Ibn Hibbaan's authentication of the narrator makes this hadith reliable for practice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The hadith about reciting the beginning and end of Soorat al-Baqarah at the grave is very weak (da'eef jiddan) according to al-Albaani. The isnad includes unknown narrators like 'Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn al-'Alaa' ibn al-Lajlaaj. The saheeh report from Ibn 'Umar is about saying 'Bismillah wa billah wa 'ala millati Rasoolillah' when the deceased is placed in the grave."

      "question": "What testimony is required from the four witnesses to establish the crime of zina (adultery/fornication)?",
      "options": [
        "The four witnesses must testify that they saw the man's penis in the woman's vagina in clear terms",
        "Witnesses seeing the man and woman naked together or in compromising positions is sufficient to establish zina",
        "High dowries and expensive weddings help protect society from the spread of zina and immorality",
        "The hadd punishment for zina was commonly applied through witness testimony throughout Islamic history"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The four witnesses to zina must describe it in clear terms, such as saying 'I saw his penis in her vagina.' There is no alternative to that explicit testimony. If they only say they saw them naked or in certain positions, that is not sufficient. Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen mentioned that no case of zina was proven by testimony from the Prophet's time until the time of Ibn Taymiyah because it is very difficult to meet this strict requirement."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on playing cards without gambling?",
      "options": [
        "Playing cards is prohibited even without gambling because it wastes time, resembles dice playing, includes pictures of souls (Jack and Queen), and promotes cheating and deception",
        "Playing cards is permissible as long as there is no gambling or betting involved",
        "Cards are only prohibited if they cause you to miss prayer times",
        "The Jack and Queen pictures can be removed from the deck to make card-playing permissible"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Playing cards is prohibited for multiple reasons: (1) wasting time with no benefit, (2) based on gambling and resembles dice which is clearly prohibited, (3) includes pictures of creations with souls (Jack and Queen), (4) causes rancor and enmity between players, (5) promotes cheating and deception, and (6) distracts from worship of Allah. The Prophet said whoever plays with dice resembles one who has tainted his hand with the flesh and blood of a pig."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on religiously committed women having boyfriends with whom they engage in intimacy like hugging and kissing, intending to marry them later?",
      "options": [
        "Having a boyfriend with intimacy like hugging and kissing is haraam and abhorrent, not excused by emotional attachment or intention to marry",
        "Their worship and prayers are still accepted since they regret their actions and plan to marry these men",
        "This relationship is permissible since they have not committed fornication and intend to marry in the future",
        "Their knowledge of Islamic rulings excuses them from the sin since they are religiously committed and aware it is wrong"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Having boyfriends with intimacy is haraam and abhorrent. Allah describes chaste believing women as those who avoid 'taking boyfriends.' The excuse of emotional attachment is the essence of following whims and desires which lead to doom. The one who knows bears greater responsibility, and going against knowledge is worse and more reprehensible. Knowledge alone does not prevent sin, as shown by the example of Iblees and the Jews who knew the truth but rejected it."

      "question": "What does Islam teach about women's capabilities compared to men in terms of leadership, scholarship, and achievement?",
      "options": [
        "Individual women may be superior to some men, but this is rare when comparing men and women as a whole across leadership positions, inventions, and scholarship throughout history",
        "Women are generally more active and superior to men in most fields of work and leadership roles",
        "Secular societies provide better rights and protection for women than Islamic societies do",
        "Jihad is not applicable in this modern age and was only prescribed for the early Islamic period"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "While some women may be superior to some men, this is rare overall. Looking at all nations, the vast majority of presidents, prime ministers, ministers, CEOs, inventors, explorers, and scholars throughout human history have been men, confirming men's general superiority in these roles. Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen stated that saying 'men are better than women' doesn't mean each individual man is superior to each individual woman, but that the category in general is superior, though individual women may be superior to some men."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on describing someone as boring when speaking about them in their absence?",
      "options": [
        "Describing someone as boring in his absence is backbiting (gheebah), even if said in anger, and requires repentance",
        "Criticizing someone in his presence is backbiting, while criticizing in his absence is reviling",
        "Speaking ill of someone in anger is not considered backbiting since it was said in an emotional moment",
        "Backbiting only applies if what you say is untrue; if it's true then it's permissible to say"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Prophet defined backbiting as saying about your brother in his absence something that he dislikes, even if it is true. If it's untrue, then it's a grave lie. Saying someone is boring in his absence constitutes backbiting even if said in anger, because anger does not make it permissible. Backbiting refers to speaking ill in absence; criticizing in presence is insulting/reviling which is also haraam. One should repent and apologize if the person heard, or seek forgiveness and pray for him if he didn't."
