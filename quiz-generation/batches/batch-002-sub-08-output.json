      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on a lawyer defending clients in legal cases?",
      "correctAnswer": "A lawyer should only defend clients who are in the right and must not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves or try to prevent hadd punishments from being carried out",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "A lawyer can defend any client regardless of whether their case is true or false, as long as they are paid a fee for their representation services",
        "A lawyer must refuse all cases involving criminal matters because the Prophet forbade Muslims from representing others in disputes",
        "A lawyer can defend clients in wrongdoing as long as they privately advise them to fear Allah, even if they publicly argue the false case in court"
      ],
      "explanation": "The practice of law is permissible when defending those in the right, but forbidden when defending falsehood. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned that whoever argues for a false case knowingly will remain subject to Allah's wrath, and anyone whose intercession prevents a hadd punishment has opposed Allah. A Muslim lawyer must fear Allah and not defend wrongdoing."

      "question": "What should the owner of a café do if men and women are mixing in his establishment?",
      "correctAnswer": "The café owner should prevent the mixing, restrict the café to men only, or seek other permissible work, as allowing mixing is a sin even though he has refused to sell forbidden items",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "The café owner has fulfilled all Islamic requirements by refusing to sell cigarettes and forbidding things against Islamic etiquette, so the mixing is now permissible",
        "The café owner can continue allowing mixing as long as he privately feels uneasy about it and fears Allah in his heart without taking action",
        "The café owner should designate separate doors for men and women to enter the café, which will make the mixing permissible like in the mosque"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Quran and Sunnah indicate that mixing is haraam. Allah says to ask the Prophet's wives from behind a screen as it is purer for hearts. The Prophet separated men and women in mosques and designated a door specifically for women. If these precautions apply in the pure place of worship, they are even more important elsewhere. The café owner must prevent mixing, restrict to men only, or find other work."

      "question": "What should a woman who committed adultery and is now contemplating suicide do?",
      "correctAnswer": "She must verify that both her divorce and current marriage contract are valid according to sharia, repent sincerely, do good deeds, and never consider suicide as it is a grievous major sin that leads to eternal punishment",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "She should immediately separate from her current husband because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery can never become valid even after sincere repentance",
        "She has committed such a grave sin that Allah's mercy cannot reach her, so she should focus only on doing good deeds for the rest of her life",
        "She should confess her adultery publicly to the Islamic authorities so they can carry out the hadd punishment, as this is the only way to expiate her sin"
      ],
      "explanation": "A marriage between two people guilty of adultery is not valid unless they have repented, so the contracts must be verified and repeated if necessary. Allah will forgive all sins if she is sincere in repentance and determined never to repeat it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned that whoever kills himself will be doing that same action in the Fire of Hell for all eternity, making suicide one of the most grievous major sins."

      "question": "Who was the first Caliph after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and what was the significance of Ghadeer Khum?",
      "correctAnswer": "Abu Bakr was the first Caliph by consensus of the Sahabah, and the Prophet's advice at Ghadeer Khum was to honor his household, not to give them preference over more virtuous companions like Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "Ali was the first Caliph as designated by the Prophet at Ghadeer Khum, but the Sahabah rejected this designation and chose Abu Bakr instead, causing the initial dispute",
        "The initial dispute between the Muhaajireen and Ansaar was about whether to give bay'ah to Ali or Abu Bakr, and they eventually compromised by choosing Abu Bakr first",
        "The people of the Prophet's household mentioned at Ghadeer Khum are to be given preference in positions of leadership over other Sahabah like Abu Bakr and Umar"
      ],
      "explanation": "Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq was the first Caliph according to the consensus of scholars and the unanimous bay'ah of the Sahabah. None of the Sahabah asked to give bay'ah to Ali after Abu Bakr or after Umar. At Ghadeer Khum, the Prophet reminded people about his household (family of Ali, Aqeel, Ja'far, and Abbas), which means honoring and respecting them, but not giving them preference over those known to be more virtuous."

      "question": "What is the ruling on disturbing graves found on one's land?",
      "correctAnswer": "It is not permissible to disturb the graves by digging up the remains, walking over them, or any form of disrespect, and a fence should be erected to preserve their dignity as the sanctity of the dead is like the sanctity of the living",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "The graves can be moved to another location as long as the remains are handled respectfully and reburied in a proper graveyard with proper Islamic burial rites",
        "The landowner has the right to remove the graves if he owns the land title, but he must notify the families of the deceased first to give them time to relocate the remains",
        "Walking over the graves is permissible as long as no damage is done to the grave markers or tombstones, but digging up the remains is absolutely forbidden"
      ],
      "explanation": "Those buried own the land by virtue of being buried there, and it is not permissible to disturb them whether by digging up remains, walking over graves, or any other form of disrespect. A fence should be put up around the graves to prevent disrespect and preserve their dignity, because the sanctity of the dead among the Muslims is like the sanctity of the living."

      "question": "What is the ruling on praying on a prayer mat?",
      "correctAnswer": "Praying on a mat is permissible in principle, but becomes problematic if the mat contains images of animate beings, has distracting decorations, or if one insists on using it thinking it's essential when this was not the way of the salaf",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "Praying on a mat is always recommended because it protects the worshipper from impurity on the ground and helps maintain proper focus and humility in prayer",
        "The Prophet always used a prayer mat and never prayed directly on the ground, so Muslims should follow this sunnah by always using a mat for their prayers",
        "Having a special mat for the imam in the mosque is recommended because it helps distinguish him from other worshippers and shows proper respect for his leadership position"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed on mats, carpets, and animal pelts, showing it is permissible. However, it becomes impermissible if the mat has images of animate beings, makruh if it has distracting decorations, and problematic if one insists it's essential. The Prophet prostrated in mud and water showing humility. At the time of the salaf, none had a rug just for prayer; Imam Malik even said spreading a rug in the mosque is bid'ah."

      "question": "Can a lender accept repayment from an interest-based bank when the debtor transferred the debt to that bank?",
      "correctAnswer": "The lender may take his money from the bank because he is not a party to the interest-based transaction between the bank and the debtor, though he should try to advise both parties about the prohibition of interest",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "The lender must refuse to take the money from the bank because any involvement with an interest-based institution makes the money haram for him to accept",
        "The lender can take the money only if he donates an equivalent amount to charity to purify it from the interest contamination before using it",
        "The lender must first investigate how much interest the bank charged the debtor and subtract that amount before accepting the payment to avoid benefiting from riba"
      ],
      "explanation": "It may be permissible for the lender to take what he is owed from the bank because he is not a party to the interest-based transaction that occurred between the bank and the debtor. However, he should try to advise both parties about the prohibition of interest in Islam."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on professional boxing?",
      "correctAnswer": "Boxing is haram because it involves attacking the face which the Prophet forbade, causes irreparable harm including brain and nerve damage, wastes time and money, and involves uncovering the awrah of both fighters and spectators",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "Boxing is permissible if done only against non-Muslims and with the intention to prepare for jihad, as this makes it a legitimate form of training for defending Islam",
        "Boxing is permissible as long as the boxer uses the money earned for charity and speaks about Islam to encourage the youth to follow the right path",
        "Boxing is permissible if the fighter covers his awrah properly from navel to knee and makes an effort to avoid hitting the opponent's face directly during matches"
      ],
      "explanation": "Boxing is the worst of sports because: (1) it involves attacking the face which the Prophet specifically forbade; (2) it wastes time that Allah will question us about; (3) it causes irreparable damage including permanent brain and nerve injuries; (4) it involves uncovering the awrah from navel to knee; (5) it wastes money. The Prophet said 'avoid the face' and 'there should be no harm.' For jihad preparation, one can strengthen the body with other sports that are not haram."

      "question": "How should a woman determine whether bleeding caused by abortion pills requires her to stop praying?",
      "correctAnswer": "If the bleeding has menstrual characteristics (deep red, thick, characteristic smell) it is menses and she cannot pray or fast, but if it's light red with no smell it is istihaadah and she should wash, do wudoo', and pray while wearing sanitary pads",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "All bleeding caused by abortion pills is considered istihaadah regardless of its color or smell, so the woman must continue praying and fasting in all cases",
        "All bleeding caused by abortion pills is considered menstrual blood regardless of its characteristics, so the woman must stop praying and fasting until the bleeding completely stops",
        "The woman should wait fifteen days to see if the bleeding continues, and only then determine if it is menses or istihaadah based on the duration rather than the blood characteristics"
      ],
      "explanation": "Scholars favor examining the blood: if it has menstrual characteristics (deep red, thick, with characteristic smell), it is menstrual blood and she cannot pray, fast, or have intercourse. If it is light red with no smell, it is istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding) and she should wash, do wudoo', pray, and wear sanitary pads. The same ruling applies to bleeding after surgery. Any bleeding beyond 15 days is istihaadah according to the majority."

      "question": "What is the ruling when a husband resorts to masturbation because his wife frequently refuses intimacy?",
      "correctAnswer": "The wife is obliged to respond to her husband unless she has a valid excuse like menstruation, sickness, or observing an obligatory fast; masturbation by the husband's own hand is prohibited, but the wife can use her hand to satisfy him as this is permissible enjoyment",
      "wrongAnswers": [
        "The husband has the right to masturbate by his own hand if his wife refuses him for any reason, as this is better than falling into the greater sin of adultery",
        "The wife can refuse her husband's call to bed whenever she feels tired or lazy to make ghusl, as forcing herself to comply would harm her and Islam prohibits harm",
        "If the wife refuses without a valid excuse, the husband should immediately refer the matter to a judge rather than trying to communicate with her about their Islamic rights and duties"
      ],
      "explanation": "The wife is obliged to obey when her husband calls her to bed, and if she refuses the angels curse her until morning. However, she is not sinning if she has a valid excuse (menstruating, sick and likely harmed, or observing obligatory fast). Masturbation by one's own hand is prohibited, but there is no sin if the wife uses her hand to satisfy him, as the verse permits enjoying one's wife. Both spouses should communicate frankly about rights and duties in a kind, loving manner."
