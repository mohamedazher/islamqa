      "title": "The meaning of enslavement in Islam",
      "question": "<p>Can you please clarify the subject of Slaves in Islam. In The Koran, there are many mentions of this term in particular the instance where man is the slave to his Master Allah, which I fully understand and agree. But in many instances the Koran cites where one man/woman is the slave of another man/woman. In what context has Allah made this permissible, if it is permissible. Your clarification on this subject would be most grateful.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The enslavement of the Muslim to Allaah, may He be glorified, is what He had commanded in His Book and is the Message with which He sent the Messengers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah)” [al-Nahl 16:36].</p>\n<p>The word ‘Uboodiyyah (enslavement) in Arabic comes from the word Ta’beed (enthrallment, subjugation). The phrase ‘abbadtu’l-tareeq means “I made the way smooth and easy to walk on.” The enslavement of the slave to Allaah has two meanings, one general and one specific. If by “slave” I mean al-mu’abbad, i.e., one who is subjugated, this is the general meaning which includes every created thing in the both the higher and the lower realms, sentient and otherwise, animate and inanimate, moving and stationary, kaafir and mu’min, righteous and immoral, for every creature is subjugated by Allaah and is subject to His control, and for each of them there is a limit at which it stops.</p>\n<p>If by “slave” I mean al-‘aabid, one who worships Allaah and obeys His commands, this meaning applies specifically to the believers to the exclusion of the kaafireen, because the believers are the true slaves of Allaah who attribute Lordship and Divinity to Him Alone and recognize Him by His Names and Attributes, and do not associate anything with Him. As Allaah says in the story of Iblees (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“[Iblees (Satan)] said: ‘O my Lord! Because You misled me, I shall indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I shall mislead them all. Except Your chosen, (guided) slaves among them.’&nbsp;(Allaah) said: ‘This is the Way which will lead straight to Me. Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the Ghaawoon (Mushrikoon and those who go astray, criminals, polytheists, and evildoers).’” [al-Hijr 15:39-42]</p>\n<p>With regard to the ‘ibaadah (worship) which Allaah enjoins upon us, this is a word which includes everything that Allaah loves and is pleased with of words and deeds, both open and hidden, and excludes anything that may cancel that out. This definition includes the Shahaadatayn, Salaah, Hajj, fasting, jihaad for the sake of Allaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and believing in Allaah, the angels, the Messengers and the Last Day. The basis for this worship is purity of intention, so that the aim of the worshipper is to seek the Face of Allaah, may He be glorified, and the Home of the Hereafter. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And Al-Muttaqûn (the pious) will be far removed from it (Hell). He who spends his wealth for increase in self-purification, And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back, Except to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High. He surely, will be pleased (when he will enter Paradise).” [al-Layl 92:17-21]</p>\n<p>So purity of intention is essential, as is sincerity, so that the believer strives to follow what Allaah has commanded and to avoid what He has forbidden, prepares himself for the Meeting with Allaah (may He be exalted), gives up feeling helpless and lazy, and refrains from following his own desires, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).” [al-Tawbah 9:119]</p>\n<p>It is also essential to follow the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so the worshipper should worship Allaah in accordance with what He has prescribed and not in accordance with what created beings desire or innovate. This is the aim of following the Prophet who was sent from Allaah, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Purity of intention, sincerity and following the Messenger are all essential. Once these matters are understood, then it will be clear to us that everything that goes against these essentials is in fact enslavement to people. So showing off is a form of enslavement to people; Shirk is a form of enslavement to people; neglecting Allaah’s commands and angering the Lord in order to earn people’s approval is a form of enslavement to people. Everyone who puts following his own desires before obeying his Lord has gone beyond the bounds of ‘Uboodiyyah (enslavement to Allaah) and has deviated from the Straight Path. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Doomed is the slave of the dinar, doomed is the slave of the dirham, doomed is the slave of fine cloth and doomed is the slave of velvet. If he is given something he is pleased and if he is denied, he is angry. Doomed is he! If he is pierced by a thorn, may he never be able to remove it.”</p>\n<p>Enslavement to Allaah includes and implies love, fear and hope. The slave loves his Lord, fears His punishment and hopes for His Mercy and reward. These are the three essential pillars of ‘Uboodiyyah or enslavement.</p>\n<p>Enslavement to Allaah is an honour, not a cause of humiliation, as the poet said:</p>\n<p>“What increases me in honour and pride, so that my feet nearly stepped on the Pleiades, is that I am included in Your words ‘O My slaves,’ and that You made Ahmad my Prophet.”</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to make us among His righteous slaves. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to curse those who commit sin?",
      "question": "<p>Among us, if one man curses another and the curse receives no response because he does not deserve that, does it come back on the first man or not? Is it permissible to curse a woman on the grounds that she is not wearing hijab?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Cursing is not one of the attributes of the believer who has     attained perfect faith. It was narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad     and Imam al-Tirmidhi in his Jaami’ from ‘Alqamah that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn     Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer is not a     slanderer, one who curses a great deal, one who indulges in obscenity or who     in engages in foul talk.” Al-Tirmidhi said: It is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth.     And it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from Thaabit ibn al-Dahhaak that     the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursing     a believer is like killing him.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this, it is not permissible for a believer to curse     anyone among his Muslim brothers except those whom Allaah cursed in His Book     or whom the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     cursed. It is not permissible to curse one who commits a sin because of his     or her sin, such as a woman who is not wearing hijab and the like. Rather     the Muslim should advise her and encourage her to wear hijab using kind and     gentle methods. If anyone curses someone who does not deserve to be cursed,     there is a stern warning that the curse will come back on the one who utters     it if it is not justified. This is indicated by the report narrated by     Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of     Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a person     curses something, the curse ascends to heaven, and the gates of heaven are     closed to it. Then it comes back down to earth and the gates of earth are     closed to it. Then it looks right and left, and if it does not find anywhere     to go, it goes to the one who was cursed, and if he deserves it (it befalls     him), otherwise it goes back to the one who uttered it.” Narrated by Abu     Dawood in his Sunan. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send     blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.     End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "If a person is wearing two layers of khufoof or socks, which one should he wipe over?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to wipe over two layers of socks worn one over another? If that is permissible and a person wipes over them, then takes off one layer and then breaks his wudoo’, is it permissible for him to wipe over the other or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is permissible for a person to wear two layers of khufoof     or socks. If he wipes over one – in cases where it is permissible to do so,     as we shall see below – then he takes one off, and breaks his wudoo’, it is     permissible for him to wipe over the other, according to the opinion of some     of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) a number     of scenarios in which a person wears two layers of khufoof or socks, as     follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – If a person put on socks or khufoof then broke his     wudoo’, then put on another pair before doing wudoo’, the ruling applies to     the first layer, i.e., if he wants to wipe over them after that, he has to     wipe over the first layer, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over     the second layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – If he puts on socks or khufoof, then he breaks his wudoo’     and wipes over them, then he puts on a second layer, then he may wipe over     the second layer according to the sound view. It says in al-Furoo’:     That is permissible according to Maalik. End quote. Al-Nawawi said: This is     the best view, because he put them on in a state of purity (tahaarah), and     their view that it is a lesser kind of purity is not acceptable. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If we accept that, then the period of wiping starts from the     first time he wiped over the first layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In this case he may also wipe over the first layer, without a     doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – If he puts khufoof on over khufoof or socks, and he wipes     the outer layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the     remainder of the period? I did not see any clear statement on this, but     al-Nawawi stated that Abu’l-‘Abbaas ibn Surayj said that if he puts     overshoes over the khufoof then one of three scenarios must apply: one of     which is that they become like a single khuff, with the upper layer visible     and the second layer like a lining, therefore he may wipe over the lower     layer until the period for wiping ends from the time he wiped over the upper     layer, which is like the case when the outer surface of the khuff becomes     worn or scratched – it is permissible to wipe over the lining.” End quote     from Fataawa al-Tahaarah, p. 192&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The “overshoe” (jurmooq) is something that is worn over the     regular khufoof, especially in cold countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 1/130&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/211&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on installing an awning that bothers the neighbours",
      "question": "<p>Is installing an awning regarded as annoying one’s neighbours? We set up an awning over our windows so as to protect ourselves from the water that drips from our upstairs neighbours’ laundry, and because of what the children throw of food onto our air-conditioner. But the upstairs neighbours complained about two things: firstly, that they cannot see the street that is directly below the awning, and secondly, that they cannot lower what is called “as-sabt” [a bucket that is lowered to buy something from street vendors].</p>\n<p>Please note: 1. There is no complaint about any difficulty in hanging out laundry, because the distance between balconies is good for them to hang laundry. 2. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the awning is always open and cannot be closed. 3. It is very difficult for me to remove the awning, especially in the place where I hang my laundry, because their children often stand on the balcony and at the window and throw many things down. I also feel very upset if any water drips onto my laundry. I hope that you can advise me as soon as possible, because I am worried that this may come under the heading of bothering neighbours, but my Lord knows that it is not deliberate.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The ruling on putting up an awning is similar to what the jurists have discussed about putting up a balcony. They stated that it is not permissible to put up a balcony if it will harm or bother passers-by or neighbours.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Fatawa wa Rasa’il Samahat ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Shaykh</em>, 7/245: It is not allowed to build a balcony that protrudes from the building on wooden beams, whether it is small or large.</p>\n<p>The three imams [Malik, Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafa`i] favoured the view that it is permissible to do that, so long as it will not cause any harm to passers-by or neighbours, and this is more appropriate. Similar to wood are the long metal beams on which wood is placed. In fact this refers to a balcony and other similar things that could block the air of the street. End quote.</p>\n<p>In <em>al-Bayan fi Madhhab al-Imam ash-Shafa`i</em>, 6/252, it says: If a balcony protrudes into an open ended street (that is, not a cul-de-sac), we think that if it does not bother the Muslims, it is permissible and should not be prevented. This was stated by Malik, al-Awza`i, Ahmad, Is-haq, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on them). End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his ruling: The correct view is that there is nothing wrong with attaching something ordinary to a building that does not bother people, with the permission of the authorities. But if it is something that does bother people, then it is not permissible, even if the authorities in the city, such as the mayor, gave permission for that.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>ash-Sharh al-Mumti` ‘ala Zad al-Mustaqni`</em>, 9/254.</p>\n<p>People usually install awnings for protection from the sun and rain, to conceal the occupants of the house, and to ward off annoyance that can come from upper floors – as mentioned in the question. So what appears to be the case is that it is permissible to install this awning, but you should adjust it when installing it so that there will be room for the neighbours to lower their buckets, because they are clearly bothered by that. But at the same time, they should put a stop to the harm that is coming from their side. If they do not do that, there is nothing wrong with you leaving the awning, because you did not install it for the purpose of annoying and harming your neighbours; rather you did it so as to ward off the annoyance caused by them.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "If they agree on khula’, does the husband have the right to change his mind?",
      "question": "<p>If a man agrees to grant his wife a divorce by khula’, on the basis that she will return the mahr to him, then before she gives him the mahr the husband wants to change his mind, does he have the right to do that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If he has indeed divorced her by khula’, in the sense that     the marriage has been annulled and there is nothing left to be done except     handing over the compensation (i.e., the mahr), then he has no choice in the     matter, even if he has not yet taken back the mahr. But if they have agreed     to khula’ without yet having the marriage annulled, rather they have agreed     that he will let her go when she hands over the mahr, then this does not     mean that the marriage has been annulled, rather it is promise to annul it.     So if it has not yet been annulled, then he has the right to change his mind     and not do that which he had intended. If he had said, “If you give me the     mahr you will be free (I will give you khula’),” then according to the     Hanbali madhhab he does not have the right to change his mind. But according     to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, if he has not yet taken back the mahr then     he has the right to change his mind. In order to be on the safe side, if the     latter scenario has taken place and they want to get back together, they     should make a new marriage contract so as to put themselves beyond any area     of scholarly dispute.</p>\n",

      "title": "How to Remember Allah’s Blessings and Give Thanks for Them",
      "question": "<p>Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, enjoins us in the Holy Quran to remember the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us, numerous blessings, such as when He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning]:</p>\n<p>“O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when armies came to [attack] you and We sent upon them a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see. And ever is Allah , of what you do, Seeing.” [Al-Ahzab 33:9]</p>\n<p>My question is: how can we remember blessings as enjoined by our Lord? Is it what is meant by mentioning them before people and speaking of them, or is what is meant simply calling them to mind, or what? May Allah reward you with all good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The command mentioned in the verse quoted by the questioner is a command to the Companions and the believers to remember the blessings of Allah and His grace towards them, and His kindness to them in causing the defeat of their enemies and frustrating their enemies’ plots.</p>\n<p>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“Here Allah, may He be Exalted, is speaking of His blessings, grace and kindness to His believing slaves when He averted their enemies and inflicted defeat upon them in the year when they came together and formed an alliance against them, which was the year of Al-Khandaq [the Trench].\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir,&nbsp; 6/383)</p>\n<p>When there is a command in the Quran to remember Allah’s blessing, what is meant is to remember it in one’s heart, by calling to mind Allah’s grace and favour in bestowing it upon His slaves; remembering it in one’s words, by speaking of it; and remembering it in one’s physical actions, by not using that blessing in ways that incur the wrath of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.</p>\n<p>Remembering the blessing is <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/125984\" target=\"_blank\">giving thanks for it</a> , and may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words or in one’s actions; each of them confirms the others, unless the gratitude is false.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And remember the favour of Allah upon you.” [Al-Baqarah 2:231]:</p>\n<p>“Remembering may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions. Remembering it in one’s words means saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it]” [Ad-Duha 93:11]. So you should praise Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, for it by saying: O Allah, to You be praise for what you have blessed me with of wealth, or a wife, or children, and so on.</p>\n<p>Remembering it in one’s heart is by calling it to mind and acknowledging that it is a blessing from Allah.</p>\n<p>Remembering it in one’s actions is by striving to obey Allah, and by showing the effects of His blessing on you.\" (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah&nbsp; 3/132)</p>\n<p>Al-Harawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96807\" target=\"_blank\">What is meant by gratitude</a> is three things: acknowledging the blessing, then appreciating the blessing, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/263376\" target=\"_blank\">then giving praise for it</a> .”</p>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the words of Al-Harawi:</p>\n<p>“As for acknowledging it, that means calling it to mind, realising its significance and recognising it as a blessing in and of itself.</p>\n<p>So acknowledging it is done in the mind.</p>\n<p>Appreciating it means showing humility when receiving it from the Bestower, by expressing one’s need for it and acknowledging that it came to him without him deserving it and without him paying any price; rather he sees himself as being completely dependent upon Allah. This attitude shows true appreciation.</p>\n<p>“then giving praise for it”: praise for the Bestower in connection with the blessing is of two types: general and specific.</p>\n<p>The general type is ascribing to Him the attributes of generosity, kindness, munificence and so on.</p>\n<p>The specific type is speaking of His blessing, and stating that it came to him from Him, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it].” [Ad-Duha 93:11]</p>\n<p>Regarding this reporting or speaking of the blessing that is enjoined, there are two views:</p>\n<p><strong>The first</strong> is that it means mentioning the blessing and speaking of it, by saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such. Muqatil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Give thanks for what Allah has mentioned of blessings to you in this surah, such as helping orphans, granting guidance after misguidance, and granting self-sufficiency after poverty.</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/217369\" target=\"_blank\">Speaking of the blessings of Allah is gratitude</a> , as in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whoever has a favour done for him, let him reciprocate, and if he cannot reciprocate, then let him praise [the person who did him the favour], for if he praises him, then he has thanked him, but if he conceals it, then he has been ungrateful towards him. And whoever pretends to have what he has not been given is like one who wears two garments of falsehood.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 215; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>This Hadith mentions three types of people: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/146025\" target=\"_blank\">one who is grateful for the blessing</a> and gives praise for it; one who denies it and conceals it; and one who pretends to be one of those who were given it when that is not the case, so he pretends to have something that he was not given. In another report it says: “Whoever does not give thanks for a little will not give thanks for a great deal, and whoever does not show gratitude to people has not shown gratitude to Allah. Speaking of the blessing of Allah is gratitude, and not speaking of it is ingratitude. Unity is a mercy and division is a punishment.” [Narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad in Zawa’id Al-Musnad, 18449; classed as sound by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>The second view is that speaking of the blessing that is enjoined in this verse [at the end of Surah Ad-Duha, quoted above] means calling people to Allah, conveying His message and teaching the Ummah. Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to Prophethood. Az-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It means: Convey that with which you [O Prophet] have been sent, and speak of the Prophethood that Allah has bestowed upon you. Al-Kalbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to the Quran, which Allah commanded him to recite.</p>\n<p>The correct view is that it includes both types, because each of them is a blessing for which it is enjoined to give thanks and speak of it. Manifesting it is part of being grateful for it.\" (Madarij As-Salikin 2/237)</p>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding gratitude:</p>\n<p>“It is based on three pillars: acknowledging it inwardly, speaking of it outwardly, and using it to earn the pleasure of the One Who granted it and bestowed it.\" (Al-Wabil As-Sayyib, p. 5)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>We know that killing is happening on a wide scale today in the land of Palestine, and Muslims in the rest of the world are torn between sorrow and being unable to help. My question is: is it permissible for the Muslims not to celebrate Eid because of what is happening of tragedies in Palestine, especially if the Muslim feels grief and sorrow because of that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Eids of the Muslims have not been prescribed only for the purpose of joy, fun and visiting one another; rather they are among the symbols and acts of worship of the religion, so the Sunnah on these occasions is for the Muslims to celebrate them openly and proclaim them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Eids are among the most specific distinguishing features of different religions, and among the most obvious of their rituals.</p>\n<p>End quote from Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem (1/528)</p>\n<p>Hence you will find that every religion has its own festivals that its followers care about and celebrate openly, because they are an important part of their religion.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Expressing joy on the occasion of the Eids is one of the symbols of the religion.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fath al-Baari (2/443)</p>\n<p>So expressing joy on Eid is one of the acts of worship by which the Muslim draws closer to Allah.</p>\n<p>Ahmad (24334) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said on that day – i.e., the day on which the Ethiopians played in the mosque: “Let the Jews know that in our religion there is lenience. Verily I have been sent with an easygoing religion.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (3219).</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is no contradiction between expressing joy on Eid and feeling sorrow for what has befallen the Muslims and grieving for their situation. The Muslim expresses his joy on Eid in order to show his religious commitment openly and to show his support for his religion and at the same time he shares the sorrows of the Muslims.</p>\n<p>So the Muslim should combine both matters: he should practice the rituals and acts of worship of Islam openly, such as the Eid prayer, and he should express some measure of joy and happiness. And at the same time he should feel sorrow for what has befallen his brethren, and he should feel their pain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the more the Muslim feels the pain and anguish of his Muslim brothers, the less he will indulge in permissible kinds of entertainment and play, even if he allows himself expressions of joy on Eid and gratitude for the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21284\">21284</a> for more information on what we must do with regard to the slaughter of Muslims around the world.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7837\">7837</a> for information on how to console our brethren who are stricken by calamity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>If these drinks are not     mixed with alcohol – which is what appears to be the case – then there is no     reason why one should not buy them and consume them, because in this case     they are pure (taahir) and may be used. The fact that the company produces     haraam things such as alcohol does not mean that the sale is not valid.

He said: If any one of you is concerned about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: <em>Allahumma inni astakheeruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa asaluka min fadlika, fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa anta ‘allam al-ghuyoob. Allahumma fa in kunta ta'lamu hadhal-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) khayran li fi ‘ajil amri wa ajilihi (or: fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri) faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li thumma barik li fihi. Allahumma wa in kunta ta'lamu annahu sharrun li fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri</em> (or: <em>fi ‘ajili amri wa ajilihi</em>) <em>fasrifni ‘anhu [wasrifhu ‘anni] waqdur li al-khayr haythu kana thumma raddini bihi</em> (O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112151\" target=\"_blank\">my affairs</a> ), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it.</p>\n<p>(Reported by al-Bukhari, 6841; similar reports are also recorded by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Ahmad)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Commentary_on_the_hadith_of_istikharah\">Commentary on the hadith of <em>istikharah</em></span></h3>\n<p>Ibn Hajr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadith:</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112094\" target=\"_blank\">Istikharah</a> is a word which means asking Allah to help one make a choice, meaning choosing the best of two things where one needs to choose one of them.</p>\n<p>Concerning the phrase The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to make istikharah in all things, Ibn Abi Jamrah said: It is a general phrase which refers to something specific. With regard to matters that are wajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (liked or encouraged), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to do them, and with regard to matters that are haram (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to avoid them. The issue of istikharah is confined to matters that are mubah (allowed), or in mustahabb matters when there is a decision to be made as to which one should be given priority. I say: it refers to both great and small matters, and probably an insignificant issue could form the groundwork for a big issue.</p>\n<p>The phrase If any one of you is concerned appears in the version narrated by Ibn Mas’ud as: if any one of you wants to do something</p>\n<p>Let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer. This is mentioned to make it clear that it does not mean Fajr prayer, for example. Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar: He can pray istikarah after two rak’ahs of regular sunnah prayer done at zhuhr for example, or after two rak’ahs of any nafl prayers whether they are regularly performed or not It seems to be the case that if he made the intention to pray istikharah at the same time as intending to pray that particular prayer, this is fine, but not if he did not have this intention.</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The wisdom behind putting the salat before the du’a is that istikharah is intended to combine the goodness of this world with the goodness of the next. A person needs to knock at the door of the King (Allah), and there is nothing more effective for this than prayer, because it contains glorification and praise of Allah, and expresses one's need for Him at all times.</p>\n<p>The phrase then let him say would seem to imply that the du’a should be said after finishing the prayer, and the word thumma (then) probably means after reciting all the words of the salat and before saying salam.</p>\n<p>The phrase O Allah, I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your knowledge is explaining because You know best. Similarly, by virtue of Your power most likely means seeking Your help. I seek ability (astaqdiruka) means I ask You to give me the power or ability (qudrah) to do whatever is being asked for, or it probably means I ask You to decree (tuqaddir) this for me. So it may mean making it easy.</p>\n<p>I ask You of Your great bounty refers to the fact that Allah gives out of His great generosity, but no one has the right to His blessings. This is the opinion of Ahl al-Sunnah.</p>\n<p>You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not refers to the fact that power and knowledge belong to Allah alone, and the slave has no share of them except what Allah decrees for him.</p>\n<p>O Allah, if in Your knowledge this matter, according to one report, he should mention it by name. It is apparent from the context that he should state it, but it is probably sufficient to be thinking of the matter whilst making this du’a.</p>\n<p>Then ordain it for me means make it happen for me or it may mean make it easy for me.</p>\n<p>Then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it means so that my heart will no longer feel attached to it after it has been turned away.</p>\n<p>Make me pleased with it means make me content with it, so that I will never regret asking for it or be sorry that it happened, because I do not know how it will turn out, even if at the time of asking I am pleased with it.</p>\n<p>The secret is that one’s heart should not be attached to the matter in question, because that will result in a person becoming restless. Being pleased with something means that one’s heart is content with the decree of Allah.” (Summarized from the commentary of al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) on the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Da’wat and Kitab al-Tawheed.)</p>\n<p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.</p>\n<p>(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?</p>\n<p>His Eminence replied as follows:</p>\n<p>If the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah is the Source of strength.</p>\n",
