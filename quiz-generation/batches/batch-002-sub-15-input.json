      "title": "Isnaad of the hadeeth about the Angel of Death asking the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission to take his soul",
      "question": "<p>How sound is this hadeeth? “The angel Jibreel entered upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ‘The Angel of Death is at the door, and he is asking permission to enter upon you. He has never asked permission from anyone before you.’ He said, ‘Let him in, O Jibreel.’ The Angel of Death entered and said: ‘Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allaah. Allaah has sent me to give you the choice between staying in this world and meeting Allaah.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Rather the Higher Companion, rather the Higher Companion.’ So the Angel of Death stood at the head of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as he will stand at the head of each of us, and said: ‘O good soul, the soul of Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, come out to the good pleasure of Allaah and a Lord Who is pleased and is not angry.’”.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There are many ahaadeeth about the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Many such reports have been narrated, but the saheeh ones are mixed with the false ones, and many people are careless about quoting reports which have no basis or which have been narrated via unsound isnaads. The one who is seeking sound reports on this subject should refer to the saheeh ahaadeeth, which are sufficient and in which he will information about the incidents surrounding the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and in which there are important lessons to be learned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (5/256):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Waaqidi and others narrated many reports concerning the death (of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) in which there are many strange things. We have refrained from mentioning many of them because of their weak isnaads and dubious content, especially those narrated by many storytellers, later writers and others. Many of them are undoubtedly fabricated. In the saheeh and hasan ahaadeeth which are narrated in the well known books there is sufficient information and we have no need of lies and reports whose isnaads are unknown. And Allaah knows best. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After researching the reports about the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), we could not find the hadeeth mentioned by the questioner in this version, but there are ahaadeeth about the Angel of Death asking the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission, in wording similar to that mentioned by the questioner. But these are weak (da’eef) ahaadeeth which the scholars judged to be false and fabricated. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a hadeeth narrated by ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn from his father, telling a long story in which the Angel of Death asks for permission to enter upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and speaks with him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This story was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer (3/129) and in Kitaab al-Du’aa’ (1/367).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (9/35): Its isnaad includes ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Maymoon al-Qaddaah, whose reports are worthless.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was also judged as such by al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (4/560); al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Ajwabah Ba’d Talaameedhatihi (1/87) and Ibn Katheer in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (5/290). Al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (5384): it is mawdoo’ (fabricated).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is another hadeeth which was narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which it mentions the Angel of death seeking permission to enter upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during his final illness. This was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer (12/141).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al_Zawaa’id (9/36): its isnaad includes al-Mukhtaar ibn Naafi’, who is da’eef (weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-‘Iraaqi said in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (4/560): It isnaad includes al-Mukhtaari ibn Naafi’, whose hadeeth is rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) being given the choice between death and staying in this world, and his saying, “Rather the Higher Companion,” this is proven in al-Saheehayn in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), which is quoted in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45841\">45841</a>, q.v.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the story of the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): it is mentioned in some books of history that the Angel of Death came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the form of a Bedouin and asked for permission to enter upon him. How true is this?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is not correct. The Angel of Death did not come to him or ask permission to enter upon him, rather the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delivered a speech at the end of his life in which he said: “Allaah has given a slave the choice between immortality in this world for as long as Allaah wills, or meeting his Lord, and he has chosen to meet his Lord.” This is what he said at the end of his life. Abu Bakr wept, and the people were surprised that Abu Bakr wept at these words. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the one who was given the choice, and Abu Bakr knew the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) better than any of the people. This is what has been narrated. As for the idea that the Angel of Death came to him and asked him for permission, this is not correct. End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab il-Maftooh (2/340)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to read more saheeh ahaadeeth about the story of the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may refer to the book al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer (5/248), the chapter of the last days and death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); and Saheeh al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah by Ibraheem al-‘Ali, chapter 6: The illness and death of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Working out the ‘iddah following the death of the husband according to the Hijri date",
      "question": "<p>I want to find out when my mother’s ‘iddah will end. My father (may Allah have mercy on him – I hope that you will pray for mercy and forgiveness for him) died on Friday 6/4/2012.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to have mercy on your father and forgive him, and to have mercy on all the deceased Muslims, for He is All-Hearing, All-Responsive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman’s husband dies, if she is pregnant her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens)” [at-Talaaq 65:4].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If she is not pregnant, then her ‘iddah is four months and ten days, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days” [al-Baqarah 2:234].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The woman whose husband has died must observe ‘iddah following the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar, because the Islamic rulings are based on lunar months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Months are to be counted by new moons if the husband died at the beginning of the month. If some months are thirty days and others are twenty-nine days, then the counting is still correct and the woman in ‘iddah does not have to make up any of the days from the months that were twenty-nine days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (29/315-316): Counting the months of the ‘iddah in the event of divorce, annulment or death of the husband, is to be based on the lunar, not solar, calendar. If the divorce or death occurred at the beginning of the month, then the months are to be counted by the new moons, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: “They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage” [al-Baqarah 2:189], even if that falls short by a few days, because Allah has commanded us to observe ‘iddah by the months. He, may He be glorified, says: “their Iddah (prescribed period) is three months” [at-Talaaq 65:4] and&nbsp; “four months and ten days” [al-Baqarah 2:234]. So attention must be paid to the months, whether they are thirty days or less. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he died during the month – as in the case mentioned in the question – then she should observe ‘iddah for the remainder of the first months and for three months thereafter, with their new moons, whether they are twenty-nine or thirty days, plus ten days, then she should add whatever she missed of the first month. There are two ways to work out what she missed of the first month&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.She may regard the first month as thirty days, whether the month in which the event occurred was thirty or twenty-nine days, and if she observed ‘iddah for twenty days of that month, she should complete ten more days in the fifth month, and so on.</p>\n<p>2.She may observe ‘iddah in the fifth month for a number of days equal to what she missed of the first month, whether the month was thirty days or twenty-nine days.</p>\n<p>See: al-Mughni, 8/85; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘, 5/418; al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 29/315&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on the above, if the ‘iddah began on 6/4/2012 (6 April 2012), which corresponds to 14 Jumaada al-Oola 1433, then the ‘iddah ends on 24 Ramadan 1433, which corresponds to 12 August 2012. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>I am a 19 year old muslim brother. I want to marry a girl.</div>\n<div>I've asked her and she's agreed. The problem is that once were married she wants to go to university. But I go to uni myself and its an extremely un-islaamic environment where boys and girls mix freely, people walk around half naked, people drinking alcohol, swearing, and where there</div>\n<div>is very little morality. She wants to go to uni because she doesen't want to let her mother down because her mother has told her cousins that her dauhgter will get a degree but if she doesn't go to uni her cousins will say to her mother that I stopped her from getting a degree. What should she do. Should she go to uni where its a corrupt envornment just to keep her mother happy or not go to uni?</div>\n<div>Also after I get my degree and a couple of years working experience I want to leave this corrupt country and go to an islaamic country. I had afghanistan at the topp of my list. Is this a good idea? If not where else can I go?</div>\n<div>Thank you for any help you can give me</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the situation in the university is as you describe, then it is not permissible for her to study in that place or to go there. One of the well-known basic principles of shareeah is that there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. She should not obey her mother in this instance. She should try to convince her mother that it is haraam, by explaining to her gently and politely, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>But if they [parents] strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly [Luqmaan 31:15].</p>\n<p>If the mother does not accept this, it is still not permissible for the daughter to obey her and there will be no sin on her for that, in sha Allaah.</p>\n<p>But there is another important point we must make here:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for you to talk to this girl or to sit with her before marriage. The Prophet said: Beware of entering upon women and No man is alone with a woman, but the Shaytaan is the third one present. So beware of doing that.</p>\n<p>As for your travelling to settle in a Muslim country: look for a land where you can openly practise the rituals of Islam and where you will feel safe to practise your religion and not feel in any danger, where the environment will help you to worship your Lord properly and where there is less fitnah (temptation). Allaah is the source of help and He is the Guide, there is no god besides Him.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is working as a sales agent regarded as underselling one another?",
      "question": "<p>I work as a sales agent of a company. My job is to market and display goods that might be already available in all the shops I visit. Some of these shops have already contracted with other agents about similar goods. Is offering lower price for the same goods, in order to compete with the other agent, haram and considered outbidding my brother? Although this is the reality of working as sales agents in any company.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Al-Bukhaari (5142) and Muslim (1412) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should undersell his brother.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (1408) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “and he should not outbid his brother.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars have described the situation to which this prohibition applies. They said: With regard to the seller and the buyer, one of the following three scenarios must apply:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-1-</p>\n<p>Where they start bargaining and each party tries to make a deal with the other, and neither of them seems to be accepting the other’s offer yet. At this stage the bidding begins, if the seller has offered his product for auction, or there may be a process of underselling, if the buyer wants to see who will offer him the cheapest price in public bidding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At this stage there is nothing wrong with outbidding or underselling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-2-</p>\n<p>When both the buyer and the seller have come to an agreement and they have decided to complete the transaction. Then it is not permissible for anyone else to interfere by offering to buy or sell or any kind of bargaining. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-3-</p>\n<p>When the deal has been struck and the transaction has become binding, but there remains the option of cancelling it, either because they have not yet parted or because that option has been stipulated in the deal (whereby one or both parties have stipulated that they have the right to cancel the deal within a certain period). In that case it is not permissible for anyone to interfere and try to sell for less or buy for more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-4-</p>\n<p>If the deal has been struck between the two parties and the option of annulling is no longer available because they have parted or they did not stipulate the option of annulling, then some scholars are of the view that there is no sin on the one who intervenes between them and offers them something better. This is the view of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, based on the evidence of a report narrated by al-Nasaa’i (4504) of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar in which it says: “No one should undersell his brother until the deal has been done or cancelled.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not forbid two men before they enter into a transaction or after they depart from the place in which they did the transaction from selling whatever they want, because that is not outbidding someone else which is forbidden. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Umm (3/92).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars favoured the view that it is haraam to undersell one's brother in this manner, i.e., even after the sale has become binding and it is not possible to cancel it, because the buyer may use trickery to cancel the sale, or that may lead him to a dispute between him and the first seller because he thinks that he could have gotten that product for a lower price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: This is the view of a number of our companions, and it is more likely to be correct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi also inclined towards this view in al-Insaaf (11/178).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also viewed as more correct by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him). He said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (8/204):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This view is the correct one, i.e., that underselling one's brother is haraam, whether that is at the time when they still have the option to cancel the deal or after that. But if it happens a long time afterwards, there is nothing wrong with it. i.e., if that happens before a week or a month or the like, and he comes and says: I will give you a similar product for nine, when he had bought it for ten, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is not possible to cancel the deal at that stage. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What the sales agent should do is pay attention to the rulings and cases mentioned above, so that he will not do wrong things or commit sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he knows that the shopkeeper has decided to buy from another company, then it is not permissible for him to offer his goods to him in that case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he does not know anything – as is usually the case for most sales agents – then there is nothing wrong with him offering his products for whatever price he wants, and there is no sin in that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The refusal of ‘Umar and those who were with him to bring writing materials to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) during his illness",
      "question": "<p>One of my Shi‘i friends says that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them) disobeyed the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was on his deathbed. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked the Sahaabah at that time to bring a piece of paper and a pen, but they both refused to bring them. According to what the Shi‘ah say, the Sahaabah went astray after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) left instructions that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was to be the caliph after his death. They have proven that to me by quoting the hadith which says that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) disobeyed Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and anger could be seen on the Prophet’s face. I want to say that this friend of mine has influenced one of my friends, who do not have any information about Islam. Can you explain to me why ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) disobeyed the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? Can you also tell me how to deal with such people? I hope you can give me references. Thank you very much.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for you to make friends with any one from this group who claim to be Muslim, then they cast aspersions on the basic teachings of Islam and on those who conveyed the religion to people (i.e., the Sahaabah), and who believe that the Quran has been distorted, and that people can be infallible, and they regard the Sahaabah as apostates, apart from a few of them.</p>\n<p>What you must do with regard to these people and others like them is shun them, and warn others about their evil and misguidance.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/91665\">91665</a> and&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96231\">96231</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The wording of the hadith which speaks of the story which that Raafidi mentioned to you is as follows:</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was dying, there were men in the house among whom was ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Come, let me write for you a document after which you will not go astray.” ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is overcome with pain, and you have the Quran; the Book of Allah is sufficient for us. The people in the house disagreed, and they argued. Some of them said: Come close and let the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) write for you a document after which you will not go astray. Others agreed with what ‘Umar said. When their debating and argument in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) became too much, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Get up and leave.”</p>\n<p>‘Ubayd-Allah said: Ibn ‘Abbaas used to say: What a calamity it was when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was prevented from writing that document for them because of their disagreement and arguing.</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6932) and Muslim (1637)</p>\n<p>-1-</p>\n<p>the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed his companions who were present with him during his illness to bring a piece of paper and a pen, so that he could dictate to them something that had nothing to do with a new revelation that he had not yet conveyed to the people, or with any shar‘i instruction that the people needed that had to do with their religion. Then he decided not to tell them about that matter, because of what happened. The evidence for that is as follows:</p>\n<p>(a)This incident happened on a Thursday, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died on the following Monday, i.e., four days later. He could have asked others to write that document, but because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that, we know that it was not revelation that he could have concealed.</p>\n<p>(b)Allah, may He be exalted, praised His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for having conveyed what He revealed to him, and Allah, may He be exalted, reminded this ummah of the blessing that He had bestowed upon them by perfecting their religion and completing His favour upon them. The idea that what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not write was part of the religion that all of the ummah needs is tantamount to accusing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of not conveying the message, and it constitutes disbelief in what the Lord, may He be exalted, said about the religion being perfected and His blessing being completed upon His slaves.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The writing of this document is not something that Allah enjoined upon him to write or convey at that time. If that had been the case, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not have failed to do what Allah instructed him to do.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/315, 316)</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It was not permissible for him to abandon writing the document because of the doubts that some had about (its importance). If what he intended to write in the document was something that he was obliged to convey and disclose, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have disclosed it and written it in a document, and he would not have paid any attention to the view of anybody, for he was the most obedient of creation to Allah. Thus it is known that when he decided not to write the document, the document was not obligatory and it would not have contained anything of religious matters that he was obliged to write at that time, because if that had been necessary, he would have done it.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/12)</p>\n<p>(c)What we have mentioned is supported by the fact that the Sahaabah who were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) differed with regard to their understanding of his instruction to bring writing materials and what he really intended. Otherwise they would all have hastened to fulfil his instructions. It was proven from them that they took off their shoes during the prayer because of merely seeing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) take off his shoes during the prayer, without him instructing them to do that, so would such people have gone against an instruction if they believed it to be part of the revelation? They are far above doing such a thing. Therefore, some of them got up to bring a piece of paper and a pen, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had asked them to do, and others refrained, thinking that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) may have been overwhelmed with pain, or that his instruction was meant as a recommendation only.</p>\n<p>Abu’l-‘Abbaas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to the words “Come, let me write for you a document after which you will not go astray”, this is a command and a request that was addressed to everyone present. Hence it was the duty of everyone who was present to hasten to obey this command, especially when it was followed by the words “after which you will not go astray”. But ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and others thought that this command was not by way of obligation; rather it was by way of recommendation. Moreover, in the Book of Allah there is guidance to everything that the Muslim needs, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have sent down to you the Book (the Quran) as an exposition of everything” [an-Nahl 16:89]. In addition to that, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was suffering pain, so ‘Umar did not want him to have to do something that may be very difficult for him in that situation. Therefore they decided that it was more appropriate for him not to write anything. But the other group wanted him to write the document, following the apparent meaning of the command and out of eagerness for more clarification and to remove any ambiguity. Would that that had happened! But that is what Allah decreed, and whatever He wills happens. But there should be no blame or criticism of the first group, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not rebuke them or tell them off; rather he said to all of them: “Let me be, for I am fine.”</p>\n<p>Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhees Kitaab Muslim (15/18)</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Al-Maaziri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was permissible for the Sahaabah to differ concerning this document, despite the clear instructions given to them concerning that, because instructions may be accompanied by indications that make them less than obligatory. It is as if there was something to indicate that the matter was not obligatory; rather it was optional. Therefore they had different views, and ‘Umar insisted on his view for which he had circumstantial evidence that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had said that without insisting on it.</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (8/133, 134)</p>\n<p>-2-</p>\n<p>The Prophet’s decision to write a document was either based on revelation that came then was abrogated, or it was something that he thought would serve some interest, then he changed his mind.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) thought about writing the document when he thought that it would serve some interest, or it may be that he received some revelation concerning that, then it appeared that best interests would be served by refraining from writing it, or he received revelation to abrogate the initial command.</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/90). A similar report was narrated by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar from al-Maaziri. See: Fath al-Baari (8/134).</p>\n<p>-3-</p>\n<p>The Raafidis claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave instructions that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) should become caliph after he died, but what does this incident have to do with them? Why do they have to tamper with it and misinterpret it, claiming that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to write down instructions that ‘Ali should become the caliph after him? Why couldn’t the instructions that he wanted to write in this document be instructions for Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to become caliph after he died?</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Whoever imagines that this document would have been about the appointment of ‘Ali to the caliphate is misguided, according to the consensus of the Muslims, including the scholars of both the Sunnis and the Shi‘ah. As for the Sunnis, they are unanimously agreed that Abu Bakr is superior and is to be given precedence. As for the Shi‘ah who say that ‘Ali was the one who deserved to be the imam (caliph), they say that ‘Ali had been named as the imam (caliph) before that, in clear and unambiguous wording that was widely known. In that case, there was no need for any document.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/11)</p>\n<p>-4-</p>\n<p>It is proven via the soundest isnaad that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to give instructions that Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) should be appointed caliph after he died, then he decided not to do that, and he said that the believers would not accept anyone other than him as caliph. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me during his illness: “I was thinking – or I wanted – to send for Abu Bakr and his son and appoint him as my successor, lest people say (that the caliphate should be for So and so) or lest anyone should hope for it for themselves. Then I thought: Allah and the believers would reject anyone who is less qualified than Abu Bakr.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5342). Also narrated by Muslim (2387) with the words: “when Allah and the believers insist on Abu Bakr.”</p>\n<p>We (as Sunnis) are not concerned about that issue, because Allah and the believers decided that the successor (caliph) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should be no one but Abu Bakr.</p>\n<p>-5-</p>\n<p>What occurred of some of the Sahaabah questioning the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about some issues does not undermine the fact that they would hasten to follow his instructions and do what Islam required, because they would discuss things with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the revelation came confirming what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told them, whereupon they would hasten to obey the command.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Al-Khattaabi said: The companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would discuss some issues with him before he gave them definitive and binding instructions, as when they discussed the terms of the treaty between him and Quraysh with him on the day of al-Hudaybiyah. But once he issued definitive instructions, none of them would discuss it with him.</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/91)</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Sahaabah used to discuss some issues with him, so long as he had not issued definitive instructions; once he did that, however, they would comply with them.</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (1/209)</p>\n<p>-6-</p>\n<p>The words of ‘Umar, “the Book of Allah is sufficient for us”, were not addressed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for ‘Umar was too respectful to have done that. Rather these words were addressed to those who objected to him not bringing writing materials.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words of ‘Umar, “the Book of Allah is sufficient for us”, were answering back those who disagreed with him; it was not a counter-argument to the instruction of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/93).</p>\n<p>-7-</p>\n<p>The scholars gave the following reasons to explain why ‘Umar thought it better not to bring materials with which to write the document for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):</p>\n<p>(a)His compassion for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he did not want to burden him in that situation with having to dictate the document, because that might be too difficult for him, as he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is overcome with pain.</p>\n<p>(b)He was worried lest the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was sickness would cast aspersions on this document and express their doubts about those who transmitted it, and cast aspersions on them and their good character.</p>\n<p>(c)He was worried that he may write some instructions that they would not be able to comply with, and thus they would incur sin by not complying, and he thought it was kinder to the ummah, with regard to these issues, to leave them as a matter of ijtihaad, to be subject to examination and looking for the right answer, so that both the one who gets it right and the one who gets it wrong would be rewarded.</p>\n<p>See: Dalaa’il an-Nubuwwah (7/184); ash-Shifa bi Ta‘reef Huqooq al-Mustafa by al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (2/194); Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (11/91); Fath al-Baari (1/209)</p>\n<p>-8-</p>\n<p>With regard to the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), there is nothing in them to suggest that he was casting aspersions on the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). He was among those who swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, and to ‘Umar al-Faarooq after him. What he meant was that the thing that prevented writing down the document (i.e., the Prophet’s sickness) was itself a calamity, because turmoil emerged after that and aspersions were cast on those prominent Sahaabah.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words of Ibn ‘Abbaas, “What a calamity it was when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was prevented from writing that document” mean that the thing that prevented it happening was a calamity; it was a calamity for those who doubted the legitimacy of Abu Bakr’s caliphate, or were not certain about the matter, because if there had been a document, there would have been no doubt. As for those who knew that his caliphate was legitimate, it was not a calamity for them, praise be to Allah.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/11)</p>\n<p>-10-</p>\n<p>These words of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) were based on his own ijtihaad. No doubt ‘Umar was more knowledgeable and was senior to Ibn ‘Abbaas. Some of the scholars are of the view that the fact that the document was not written, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not object to what ‘Umar said, suggests that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) adopted ‘Umar’s opinion and thought that that was the correct thing to do.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Therefore ‘Umar was more knowledgeable than Ibn ‘Abbaas and the people who agreed with him.</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/90)</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not object to ‘Umar indicates that he thought his view was correct. When ‘Umar said, “the Book of Allah is sufficient for us”, he was referring to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “We have neglected nothing in the Book” [al-An‘aam 6:38]. It may be that the aim was to make things easier for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when ‘Umar saw that he was in great distress. Thus he sensed that what he wanted to write was not something they could not do without. If that had been the case, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not have refrained from writing it because of their differences.</p>\n<p>This view cannot be undermined by what Ibn ‘Abbaas said, “What a calamity it was…”, because ‘Umar was definitely more knowledgeable than him.</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (8/134).</p>\n<p>Thus it becomes clear that the claims of the Raafidis, casting aspersions on the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) – and especially ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) – are false. It also becomes clear that what the early generations said about them being the most mendacious of the groups that claim to be Muslims is true. So beware of them for the sake of your religious commitment. We ask Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to Islam and the Sunnah.</p>\n<p>For more information on the beliefs of the Raafidis, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/4569\">4569</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1148\">1148</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21500\">21500&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What do the scholars say about the soundness of these mawqoof hadiths that were narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah?</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr told us: Jareer told us, from Mugheerah, from Abu Waa’il and Ibraaheem, who said: When the Muslims came, they got some food from the Magians, their cheese and bread, and they ate and did not ask about that. The cheese was described to ‘Umar, and he said: Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr told us: Abu Mu‘aawiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Shaqeeq, from ‘Amr ibn Shurahbeel, who said: We mentioned cheese in the presence of ‘Umar, and we told him that it was made with rennet of animals that died of natural causes, and he said: Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr told us: Wakee‘ told us, from Sufyaan, from Jahsh, from Mu‘aawiyah ibn Qurrah, from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali that he was asked about cheese and said: There is nothing wrong with it, mention the name of Allah over it as you are cutting it, and eat. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>With regard to the first isnaad, its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), the men of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, but Mugheerah – whose full name is Mugheerah ibn Miqsam ad-Dabbi – is mudallis [i.e., he engaged in tadlees, which is when a narrator narrates a hadith that he did not hear directly from his shaykh, without mentioning the name of the third party from whom he did hear it, using wording that may or may not give the impression that he heard it directly] and he narrated it by saying ‘an [meaning “from”, instead of saying “So and so told us” or “I heard So and so saying” etc] from Abu Waa’il and Ibraaheem.</p>\n<p>See: Tadhdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/241); ath-Thiqaat by Ibn Hibbaan (7/464).</p>\n<p>What appears to be the case is that it is acceptable here because reports narrated by Mugheerah from [‘an] Abu Wa’il and Ibraaheem were narrated in as-Saheehayn, in marfoo‘ reports, and the reports here is mawqoof, and undoubtedly leniency is more acceptable in mawqoof reports.</p>\n<p>With regard to the second isnaad, its men are also the men of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. With regard to Abu Mu‘aawiyah, although more than one of the scholars had some reservations about him, their reservations were only with regard to reports other than the reports he narrated from al-A‘mash. As for the reports he narrated from al-A‘mash in particular, he used to have a good memory of them, and he is one of the most trustworthy companions of al-A‘mash. Wakee‘ said: We have not met anyone who was more knowledgeable of the reports narrated by al-A‘mash than Abu Mu‘aawiyah.</p>\n<p>See: at-Tahdheeb (9/121).</p>\n<p>Mugheerah differed from al-A‘mash. Mugheerah narrated it from Abu Waa’il – with corroborating reports from Ibraaheem, who is an-Nakha‘i – from ‘Umar, and al-A‘mash narrated it from Abu Waa’il – whose name is Shaqeeq ibn Salamah – from ‘Amr ibn Shurahbeel from ‘Umar. The hadith of al-A‘mash is more sound.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, it is narrated soundly from ‘Umar, whether via Mugheerah or via al-A‘mash.</p>\n<p>With regard to the report of al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali, its isnaad includes Jahsh whose full name is Jahsh ibn Ziyaad ad-Dabbi. Ibn Abi Haatim mentioned him in al-Jarh wa’t-Ta‘deel (2/550), but he did not mention any details regarding him. Al-Bukhaari also mentioned him in at-Taareekh (2/253) and said: ath-Thawri, Abu Bakr and Muhammad ibn Fudayl ibn Ghazwaan narrated from him. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hibbaan mentioned him in ath-Thiqaat (6/157).</p>\n<p>Therefore not much is known about him. Some scholars regard as hasan the hadith of narrators such as this, especially mawqoof reports such as this.</p>\n<p>The ruling on rennet varies according to its source. If it is taken from an animal that was slaughtered in the prescribed manner, then it is pure (taahir) and may be eaten. If it is taken from an animal that died of natural causes or from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner, then there is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ regarding that. The majority of the Maalikis, Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is najis (impure). Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, according to another report from him, are of the view that it is taahir (pure). This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said in al-Fataawa (21:103):</p>\n<p>What is more likely to be the case is that their – that is, the Magians’ – cheese is halaal and that the rennet and milk of an animal that died of natural causes are taahir. That is because when the Sahaabah conquered Iraq, they ate the cheese of the Magians, and this was the prevalent practice among them. What is narrated from some of them, that they regarded that as makrooh, is subject to further examination.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>See questions no. <a href=\"/en/answers/2841\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">2841 </a>and <a href=\"/en/answers/115306\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">115306</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>    It is not     permissible for the father to see his son’s fiancée, because she is a     non-mahram to him. It is only permissible for his son to see her with     special permission from sharee‘ah, in order to create harmony and affection     after marriage. But no exception has been narrated with regard to the man’s     father; in that case the original prohibition on seeing her remains in     effect, and she is like any other woman who is a non-mahram to him. So he is     enjoined to avert his gaze from her, not to be alone with her and not to     shake hands with her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But when his son     does the marriage contract with his fiancée, she becomes his wife, even if     he has not consummated the marriage with her, and even if in your country     she is still called a fiancée after doing the marriage contract. This     customary naming of the matter does not affect anything, so long as the     son’s marriage contract has been done. In that case it becomes permissible     for the father to look at his son’s wife, because she has become a mahram to     him, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):    “Forbidden     to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters... the wives of your     sons who (spring) from your own loins”     [an-Nisa’ 4:23].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows     best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If after six days of menstruation a woman notices some light brown discharge of some sort, is that regarded as menstruation or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If this brownish discharge that the woman sees comes before she sees that she is pure (i.e., seeing a white discharge which indicates that the period is over), then it is part of the period. If it comes after she sees that she is pure, then it is not part of the period and does not affect her praying and fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) says in his essay al-Dima’ al-Tabee’iyyah li’l-Nisa’ (p. 19) concerning discharges that may interrupt the period:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The third kind is yellowish or brownish discharge, where a woman sees yellowish blood like blood from a wound, or brownish, somewhere between yellow and black. If this happens during the period or following on from it, before the woman becomes pure, then it is part of the period and comes under the rulings on menstruation. If it comes after she becomes pure, then it is not menstruation, because Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used not to regard the brownish or yellowish discharge that comes after a woman becomes pure as being anything that mattered.” Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said in Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam (p. 258):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that if a woman becomes pure and her period is over for certain – which means that she sees the white discharge that is known to women – then any brownish or yellowish discharge or spotting or wetness that comes after she has become pure is not menstruation, so it does not prevent her from praying or fasting, and it does not prevent a man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menstruation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But she should not rush until she has seen that she is pure, because some women, when the bleeding lessens, rush and do ghusl before seeing that the period is over (the white discharge mentioned above). Hence the women of the Sahaabah used to send the cotton with yellowish discharge to the mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and she would tell them: “Do not hasten until you see the white discharge.”.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I live in America and we take some free services, especially since we are regarded as having limited income. But some of these services, such as food for example, can be taken from the churches. Is that permissible?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      There is nothing wrong with taking help from the state or       from organizations based on donations, even if they are churches, so long       as that does not lead to compromising on any issue of religion or       approving anything wrong or the children being influenced and so on. But       refraining from that and doing without it is preferable, because the upper       hand (the one that gives) is better than the lower (the one that takes),       especially with regard to taking from the church which usually has       ulterior motives in what it gives to the Muslims. Al-Bukhaari (1428)       narrated from Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allah be pleased with him) that the       Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The upper hand       (the one that gives) is better than the lower (the one that takes). Start       with those for whom you are responsible. The best of charity is that which       is given when you can afford it, and whoever refrains (from taking       charity), Allah will help him; whoever tries to do without charity, Allah       will make him independent of means. ”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (1429) and Muslim (1033) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar     (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say, when he was on the minbar,     speaking about charity and refraining from begging: “The upper hand is     better than the lower hand, and the upper hand is the one that gives and the     lower hand is the one that receives.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Asking for charity from people is something blameworthy, even     if one is asking from a Muslim, unless the one who asks is forced to do so,     because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Asking     for help causes a man to lose face, except when a man asks someone in a     position of authority or asks for something that he has no choice but to ask     for.”</p>\n<p>    Classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi and by al-Albaani in     Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was also narrated by Abu Dawood (1639) as follows:     “Begging (is like) wounds that a person scars his face with. So whoever     wishes to save face may do so, and whoever wishes not to save face may do     so, except if a person asks a person of authority, or is in a situation in     which he finds no alternative.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in Subul al-Salaam (1/548): Wounds means marks     or traces. As for his asking from a person in authority, there is no blame     in that, because he is only asking for what he is entitled to from the bayt     al-maal, and it is not a favour on the part of the person in authority,     because he is acting as a trustee, so it is like a person asking the trustee     to give him something to which he is entitled that he has with him. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (1475) and Muslim (1040) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah     ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will keep on begging from people     until he comes on the Day of Resurrection with not a bit of flesh on his     face.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Muslim (1041) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be     pleased with him) said: “Whoever begs from the people in order to accumulate     wealth, it is as if he is asking for a live coal, so let him ask for a     little or a lot.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What is meant by the words “Whoever begs from the people in     order to accumulate wealth” is that he asks of people in order to accumulate     a lot of wealth when he is not in need of it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In these hadeeths there is an eloquent rebuke, which is     clearly aimed at putting people off begging, except one who is forced to do     that and can find no other alternative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, so long as you are not in urgent need of help,     you should refrain from asking for it, but if you are in need of it, there     is nothing wrong with you asking for it and taking it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah to make you independent of means from His     bounty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",
