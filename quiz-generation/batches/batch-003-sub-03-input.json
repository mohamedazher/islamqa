      "title": "How to face the qiblah on board an airplane",
      "question": "<p>A man is travelling by plane and does not know the direction of the qiblah and no one else on board knows either. So he prays, and does not know whether he is facing the qiblah or not. Is his prayer in such cases valid?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a traveller who is on board a plane wants to pray a naafil prayer, then he can pray no matter what direction he is facing; he does not have to face the qiblah, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray whilst riding his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, if he was travelling. But in the case of the obligatory prayers, it is essential to face the qiblah and to do rukoo’ and sujood if possible. So if a person is able to pray on board the plane, then he should do so. If the prayer which falls due whilst he is on the plane can be joined with another prayer later on, e.g., Zuhr, which he can delay and join with ‘Asr, or Maghrib which he can delay and join with ‘Isha’, he can do that. He has to ask the stewards about the direction of the qiblah if he is on board an airplane which does not have a sign to show the direction of the qiblah. If he does not do that, then his prayer is not valid.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is the ruling on swallowing saliva after it reaches the lips?",
      "question": "<p>As we are wearing masks nowadays to protect ourselves against coronavirus (COVID-19), sometimes when I speak behind the mask some saliva comes out, although it is not a lot, and it sticks to the lips, so I cannot remove it, and I do not know whether it goes back into my mouth again or not. Does this invalidate the fast? What if it dries on the lips, then I close my lips after a while – is it still regarded as traces that are still there, or if it has dried can we say that there is nothing wrong with it?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If saliva reaches the lips, then the person swallows it unintentionally, such as if he licks his lips and the like unintentionally, there is no blame on him. Similarly, if it dries up, then he closes his lips, its traces disappear when it dries up, and there is nothing left that could cause one to break the fast at all, whether deliberately or by mistake.</p>\n<p>If you deliberately swallow this saliva after it reaches the lips, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether that breaks the fast.</p>\n<p>The Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that it does invalidate the fast, because in that case the saliva has separated from where it usually is, which is the inside of the mouth, so swallowing it is like&nbsp; swallowing anything else that is separate from the body.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12597\" target=\"_blank\">swallowing</a> of saliva which does not break the fast: Swallowing it from its usual place [does not break the fast], but if it has come out of the mouth, then the person brings it back with his tongue or otherwise and swallows it, it does break the fast.</p>\n<p>Our companions said: If it comes out to the outside of the lips, then he takes it back and swallows it, it breaks the fast because it is his fault and because it had left its usual place where it could be overlooked. Al-Mutawalli said: If it came out to his lips, then he took it back and swallowed it, he has broken his fast.\" (A<em>l-Majmoo‘</em> 6/342).</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If his saliva comes out and gets onto his garment or between his fingers or between his lips, then he takes it back and swallows it, he has broken the fast, because he swallowed it from somewhere other than his mouth, so it is like swallowing anything else.\" (A<em>l-Mughni</em>&nbsp; 3/17).</p>\n<p>The Hanafis are of the view that it does not invalidate the fast unless it becomes separate from the mouth, then he takes it back into his mouth.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Fath al-Qadeer</em> (2/332): If his saliva came out of his mouth, then he took it back in and swallowed it, if it did not become separate from his mouth – rather it remained connected to what is in his mouth, like a thread, and he took it in and swallowed it – he has not broken his fast. But if it became separated, then he took it back, he has broken his fast, but he does not have to offer any expiation, such as if he swallowed someone else’s saliva, or if it collected in his mouth then he swallowed it; that is makrooh, but it does not break the fast. End quote.</p>\n<p>You should be careful with regard to the saliva that accumulates on the mask and becomes separate from the mouth. So do not deliberately take it back into the mouth and swallow it.</p>\n<p>Regarding that which is difficult to avoid or enters the mouth without you intending it to, that is most likely to be overlooked, because it is a small amount and difficult to avoid. The Lawgiver overlooks traces of water that remain in the mouth after rinsing it [when doing wudoo’].</p>\n<p>If you do not know whether it entered the mouth again or not, it is more appropriate to disregard it, because the basic principle is that you have not broken the fast, and that the saliva has not returned to the mouth.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/275556\" target=\"_blank\">275556</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49005\" target=\"_blank\">49005</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on reciting the<br />\n      Qur’aan collectively in the mosque?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The question is somewhat vague. If what is meant is that    they recite it all together, in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, then this    is not prescribed in Islam and at the very least it is makrooh (disliked), because it is    not reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his    Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) did any such thing. But if this is done for    the purpose of teaching, we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is    that the people gather to recite Qur’aan in order to memorize and learn it, and each    one recites whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself – not in unison    with the others – then this is permissible because it was reported that the Messenger    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No group of people    gathers in one of the houses of Allaah to recite the Book of Allaah and study it together,    but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them, mercy comes down upon them,    and Allaah mentions them to those who are with Him.” </p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim).</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to distribute religious tapes for the deceased to be rewarded during condolence gatherings?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Distributing tapes which     contain lessons, lectures and guidance is a means of giving charity on     behalf of the deceased, if it is intended that the reward should go to him.     This is one of the best things that the living can do for the dead, and this     is confirmed in the shar’i texts which indicate that the reward will reach     the one on whose behalf charity is given.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from     ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that a man said to the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): My mother died suddenly     and I think that if she could have spoken she would have given charity; will     she have a reward if I give charity on her behalf? He said: “Yes.” Narrated     by al-Bukhaari (1388) and Muslim (1004).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Shaafa’i (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Umm (4/126):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The dead may benefit from     the actions of another in three cases: Hajj performed on his behalf, wealth     that is given in charity on his behalf, and du’aa’. … And Allaah is most     generous because He will reward the living and benefit the dead. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi narrated in     al-Majmoo’ (5/293) that the Muslims were unanimously agreed that charity     on behalf of the deceased benefits him and reaches him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Taymiyah said in     al-Fataawa al-Kubra (3/29):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The imams are agreed that     charity reaches the deceased, as do other financial acts of worship such as     freeing slaves. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar al-Haytami said     in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/72-73):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The deceased is benefited     by charity given on his behalf, such as donating Mus-hafs as a waqf and so     on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also the answer to     question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/42384\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">42384</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with     distributing these tapes as an act of charity on behalf of the deceased     during the condolence gathering or afterwards, but that is subject to the     condition that you do not believe that giving charity during the days of     mourning is of extra virtue, as some people think that giving charity during     the mourning period is essential to help the deceased in the initial period     in the grave or make him happy in his grave and other such false beliefs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>How should we deal with Muslims who do not fast in Ramadaan? What is the best way to call them to fast?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What should be done is to call these Muslims to fast and encourage them to do so, and warn them against being heedless and negligent. This may be done in the following ways:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Informing them that it is obligatory to fast, and telling them of its great importance in Islam, for it is one of the great pillars upon which Islam is built.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Reminding them of the immense reward which comes from fasting, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 38; Muslim, 760.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and His Messenger, and establishes regular prayer and fasts Ramadaan, it will be his due that Allaah will admit him to Paradise, whether he strives in jihad for the sake of Allaah or stays in the land in which he was born.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not give these glad tidings to the people?” He said: “In Paradise there are one hundred levels which Allaah has prepared for those who strive in jihad for the sake of Allaah, and the distance between each two levels is like the distance between the heaven and the earth. When you ask of Allaah, ask him for al-Firdaws, for it is in the middle of Paradise, the highest part of Paradise. Above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful and from it spring forth the rivers of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7423.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘Fasting is for Me and I shall reward for it. He gives up his desire and his food and drink for My sake. Fasting is a shield, and the fasting person has two moments of joy, one when he breaks his fast and one when he meets his Lord. And the odour that comes from the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the fragrance of musk.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7492; Muslim, 1151.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Warning the one who does not fast, and explaining that this is a major sin. Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibbaan (7491) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: ‘Climb up.’ I said: ‘I cannot do it.’ They said: ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: ‘What are these voices?’ They said: ‘This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: ‘Who are these?’ They said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Mawaarid al-Zam’aan, 1509.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then deliberately broke his fast before the time for iftaar had come. So how about one who does not fast at all? We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38747\">38747</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 – Explaining how easy and straightforward fasting is, and the joy and contentment that there is in it, and how it brings peace of mind, as well as the joy and delight in worship during the days and nights of the fast, by reading Qur’aan and praying qiyaam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6 – Inviting them to listen to some lectures and read some books that speak of the fast and its importance and discuss various issues of fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 – Not getting bored or tired of calling them and reminding them, speaking in a kind and gentle manner, as well as praying sincerely for them to be guided and forgiven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My husband has told me that in his country, many people including Shaykhs have gone to talk with the jinn. He told me that when someone has an ailment they go to the jinn for help.

      "answer": "<p>1 – Seeking the help of the jinn or turning to them to fulfill one’s desires to cause harm or bring benefit is shirk or associating others in worship with Allah, because it is a kind of mutual benefitting whereby the jinn responds to the human’s requests and fulfills his needs in return for the human’s veneration of the jinn, turning to him and asking for his help to do what he wants.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):</p>\n<p>“And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,’ and their awliya (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: ‘Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.’ He will say: ‘The Fire be your dwelling place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allah may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.’</p>\n<p>And thus We do make the Zaalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) awliya (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn.” [6:128]</p>\n<p>“And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression.” [72:6]</p>\n<p>If a human seeks the help of a jinn to cause harm to another person, or seeks his help for protection from the evil of a person whose evil he fears, all of this is shirk.</p>\n<p>Whoever is like this, his prayer and his fasting are both invalid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.”</p>\n<p>[39:65]</p>\n<p>If a person is known for doing this, then the funeral prayer is not to be offered for him if he dies, his funeral is not to be attended, and he is not to be buried in the Muslim graveyard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – The Standing Committee was asked a similar question, which said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would like to inform you that in Zambia there is a Muslim man who claims that he has jinn with him, and the people go to him and ask him to heal their diseases, and this jinn prescribes medicine for them. Is this permissible?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The answer is:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for this man to use the services of the jinn, and it is not permissible for the people to go to him, seeking treatment for their diseases through advice from the jinn, or to fulfill any needs in this manner.</p>\n<p>Treating disease by means of human doctors and by using permissible medicines means that there is no need for that. This should be enough to free us from the control of these charlatans.</p>\n<p>It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days.” [Muslim]</p>\n<p>The four authors of al-Sunan, and al-Hakim in a saheeh hadeeth, narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he said has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.”</p>\n<p>This man and his companions from among the jinn are to be regarded as fortunetellers and soothsayers. It is not permissible to ask them anything or to believe them.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>How authentic this Hadeeth is:<br />\n<br />\nIt was narrated that Ali, may Allah be pleased with him said: “While Allah’s messenger (PBUH) was sitting between the Ansaar and the Muhajireen, a group of Jews came to him and said: “Oh Muhammad! We ask you about words Allah has given to Moses Ben Imraan, Allah will not give them but to a sent messenger or a close angel. The prophet (PBUH) said: “Ask”. They said: “Oh Muhammad! Tell us about the five prayers that Allah obligated upon your nation”. The prophet (PBUH) said:<br />\n<br />\n“Fajr prayer: the sun rises between two horns of Satan, to it every disbeliever prostrates. Every believer who prays Fajr in congregation for forty days Allah will grant him two warrants, to save him from hell and hypocrisy.

Every believer who prays this prayer Allah will prevent him from the flames of hell at the Day of Resurrection.  <br />\n<br />\nAsr prayer: Is the time of when Adam, peace be upon him, ate from the tree. Every believer who prays this prayer Allah will clear him of all his since as if he was just born. <br />\n<br />\nMaghrib prayer: Is the time Allah accepted Adam’s repentance. Every believer who prays this prayer and asks Allah for anything, Allah will definitely give it to him.  <br />\n<br />\nIsha prayer: The grave is dark; the Day of Resurrection is also dark. Every believer who walks in darkness to pray this prayer, Allah will prevent him from hell, and he will given light by which he passes the Siraat (a bridge over hell in the hereafter).

There is a     considerable amount of evidence for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – We did not find this     hadeeth in any of the books that narrate ahaadeeth with isnaad, rather those     who mentioned it narrated it from people without an isnaad. It is a well     known principle in our religion that any hadeeth that was not narrated by     the scholars of hadeeth with a saheeh isnaad is to be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Another of the obvious     signs that it is fabricated is the fact that we found this hadeeth quoted in     the book of Abu’l-Layth al-Samarqandi (d. 375 AH). The name of his book is    Tanbeeh al-Ghaafileen bi Ahaadeeth Sayyid al-Anbiya’ wa’l-Mursaleen     (p. 264-265). The scholars have stated that this book of his consists of     false and fabricated ahaadeeth. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah     have mercy on him) listed him in Talkhees al-Istighaathah (1/73) as     being among the authors who could not tell sound reports from weak, and who     has no experience of either narrated reports or of narrators, rather they     narrated both saheeh and da’eef reports, and they did not distinguish     between the two. And Imam al-Dhahabi said in his biography in Siyar     A’laam al-Nubala’ (16/323): he could accept fabricated ahaadeeth sue to     lack of knowledge. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Another reason why it     is to be rejected is that he says of Zuhr prayer that it is a time when Hell     is stoked. But what is proven is that the time when Hell is stoked is just     before the sun passes the meridian, just before Zuhr, but when the time for     Zuhr begins, the time of mercy begins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that     ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray four rak’ahs before Zuhr,     after the sun had passed the meridian, and he said: “The gates of heaven are     opened and I like to send forth a good deed at this time.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Ahmad (3/411);     classed as hasan by Ibn Hajar in Nataa’ij al-Afkaar (6/3) and by     Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (3404) and by the     commentators on al-Musnad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another reason is that it     goes against that which is mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth, that the five     daily prayers are one of the unique characteristics of the ummah of Muhammad      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they were not enjoined     on any of the Prophets who came before him. Although some of the scholars     disagreed with that, this is the correct view in sha Allaah. Al-Suyooti     wrote a chapter in al-Khasaa’is al-Kubra (2/303) entitled: Chapter on     the unique characteristics of (the Prophet)  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) in that the five daily prayers were all enjoined upon     him, which were not all enjoined for anyone else, and he was the first one     to pray ‘Isha’, which no Prophet before him prayed. In this chapter he     quoted a number of ahaadeeth, including the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from     Mu’aadh ibn Jabal that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said: “Delay this prayer (‘Isha’) until it is dark, for you have     been favoured with it over all other nations, and no nation prayed this     prayer before you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood     (421); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – Another sign of the     weakness of this hadeeth is that it defines the time when Adam ate from the     tree, and the time when Allaah accepted his repentance. Such details are     akin to what is mentioned in the Israa’eeliyaat (reports from Jewish     sources) and reports that are narrated from the People of the Book, which     makes it likely that this report was taken from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, this report is     false and has no basis, so it is not permissible to narrate it or attribute     it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or to     quote it on websites or in chat rooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>What the wife is obliged to do is to obey her     husband; he is the one whom she is obliged to obey. If the husband agrees that she may visit her family, it does not matter if his parents do not     approve.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But a woman should strive to please her     husband’s parents and treat them in a manner that is better, and not confront them. This will have a great effect on giving stability to her life     with her husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should understand that your husband’s     parents may make things difficult for you because they think that you have taken away the one who is most dear to them. So you should handle this     matter wisely and not be the cause of arguments or division between your husband and his parents. Rather you should try to help your husband obey     and honour his parents, and you will find the effects of that, in sha Allah, in your own children [i.e., they will honour you in turn].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have to treat them kindly, because     kindness is never to be found in a thing but it beautifies it, and it is never lacking in a thing but it makes it ugly. If you see that they are     treating you badly, then remember the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Repel (the evil) with one which is better     (i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between     whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend”</p>\n<p>[Fussilat 41:34]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see al-Mughni,     7/225&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on working in a company that promotes satellite channels",
      "question": "<p>I am sending this message to you because I am so anxious about this problem, namely the place where I work. It is a satellite TV company, one of whose channels is the Iqra’ religious channel which broadcasts religious programming, but there are also other channels such as music channels and Arabic movies. What should I do? Praise be to Allaah, I am a religiously-committed and bearded young man and I follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). My work is in the switchboard of the company; I answer the phones and transfer calls to the employees, and vice versa. At the same time I am looking for other work, but I cannot find anything. In my heart I am worried because of this work. Every time I hear the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “The slave’s feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection until he has been asked about four things,” including his wealth, I get worried because of that. I hope that you will advise me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We ask Allaah to guide you towards that which is best for     your religious commitment and worldly affairs, and we ask Allaah to grant     you a goodly (halaal) provision and to bless it for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your work in this company is not permissible, and it is     haraam earnings, because this company facilitates channels that promote     immorality, deviation and misguidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has forbidden us to commit sin and do haraam things     directly, and He has also forbidden us to help others in doing so. Allaah     says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has     indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of     unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of     all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with     Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah     of which you have no knowledge”</p>\n<p>    [al-‘Araaf 7:33]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Help you one another in     Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one     another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe     in punishment”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>Anyone who thinks about     these immoral channels will be amazed by the audacity of these people in     spreading immorality and opposition to sharee’ah and decent morals. For     every deviation, temptation or misguidance caused by these channels to any     individual, those who produce and work for these channels have a share of     the sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day     of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without     knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nahl 16:25]</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Abu     Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… whoever calls to misguidance will     have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without that     detracting from their sins in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 2674.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Our advice to you is to leave this job, and look for other     work that is halaal and good. Be patient in bearing the problems that you     will encounter, for the reward of Allaah is precious. What matters is not     the work, rather what matters is that the work should be halaal. Beware of     nourishing your body on haraam food (earned through haraam work), and     remember that no soul will die until it has received its provision in full     and lived the time span decreed for it. Read the following hadeeth well and     think about it:</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “There is nothing that will bring you closer to Paradise but I have     enjoined it upon you, and there is nothing that will bring you closer to     Hell but I have forbidden it to you. The Holy Spirit (i.e. Jibreel) inspired     to me that no soul will die until it has been given its provision in full.     Fear Allaah and be moderate in seeking a living, and do not let the fact     that it is slow in coming make you seek it by disobeying Allaah, for that     which is with Allaah cannot be attained except by obeying Him.” See     al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2866.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Remember that Allaah has commanded us to eat from that which     is good and permissible (al-tayyibaat) and He has told us that haraam wealth     is one of the things that prevent du’aa’s from being answered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with     him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said: “Allaah is Good and does not accept anything but that which     is good. Allaah has issued the same command to the believers as He issued to     the Messengers, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘O (you) Messengers!     Eat of the Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods which Allaah has     made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats,     vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well‑Acquainted     with what you do’</p>\n<p>    [al-Mu’minoon 23:51]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic     Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with’</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:172].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Then he mentioned a man who has traveled for a long time and     is disheveled and dusty, and stretches forth his hands towards heaven,     saying, “O Lord, O Lord,” but his food is haraam, his drink is haraam, his     clothing is haraam and his nourishment is haraam, so how could he receive a     response? Narrated by Muslim, 1015.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So seek the help of Allaah and seek reward from Allaah. We     ask Allaah to give you strength and guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",
