      "question": "A traveler is fasting on a plane that takes off before sunset. When should they break their fast?",
      "options": [
        "Continue fasting until the sun sets at their altitude in the plane",
        "Break the fast as soon as a nearby city on the ground has broken their fast",
        "Immediately resume fasting if the sun becomes visible again after takeoff",
        "Request the pilot descend below cloud level so the fast can end sooner"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "If the plane takes off before sunset and the person wants to complete that day's fast while traveling, they should not break their fast until the sun sets in the place where they are in the air. The Standing Committee stated that as long as the fasting person can still see the sun, they cannot break their fast, even if a nearby city has already broken the fast, as the Quranic verse commands to complete the fast until nightfall."

      "question": "Someone has gold that reached nisaab and then acquires new gold during the year. How should zakaah be calculated?",
      "options": [
        "Start a separate year for the new gold from the day of acquisition, or optionally pay zakaah early by combining it with the old gold's due date",
        "Recalculate the nisaab threshold by adding the new gold's weight to the beginning-of-year amount",
        "Restart the zakaah year for all gold from the date the new gold was acquired",
        "Wait until both the old and new gold have completed their individual years before paying any zakaah"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "When new gold is acquired during the year, a separate year should be started for the newly-acquired gold from the day it came into possession. Zakaah should be given on the old gold when its year passes, then on the new gold when its year passes. Alternatively, if desired, zakaah can be given on all the gold together when the old gold's year passes, which is called giving zakaah in advance."

      "question": "A young man used to take phone cards from his father's store without permission. After repenting, what must he do?",
      "options": [
        "Estimate the value of the cards taken and return the money to his father without necessarily disclosing what he did",
        "Confess directly to his parents about each card taken to ensure complete transparency",
        "Only perform extra acts of worship without returning the monetary value",
        "Wait until he can calculate the exact amount before making any repayment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Valid repentance requires immediately giving up the forbidden action, resolving not to return to it, and restoring people's rightful property. He does not have to tell his father what he did, but he must return the money in whatever way he can. He should try hard to figure out the value of the cards he took without permission and give this money to his father."

      "question": "What is the ruling on starting a catering business that supplies food for Christian celebrations, weddings, and birthday parties?",
      "options": [
        "It is prohibited because these celebrations involve haraam elements and helping others with prohibited matters is forbidden",
        "It is permissible as long as the caterer does not personally attend the celebrations",
        "Christian wedding parties are acceptable to cater because they are not haraam in their origins",
        "Only Christmas and New Year catering is prohibited, while birthday parties and other celebrations are acceptable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "It is haraam to start this business because parties for Christian festivals are haraam to participate in, and Christian wedding parties will never be free of prohibited matters such as free mixing, wanton display, singing, and music. Allah says in the Quran (5:2) not to help one another in sin and transgression. Therefore, it is not allowed to provide services that help facilitate these prohibited celebrations."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

However, he is not permitted at all to go to places where there is corruption and free mixing where he is likely to meet women.

He should stick to righteous company, keep away from evil things and people, and do everything that will help him remain chaste, such as hastening to marry and lowering his gaze."

      "question": "A man wants to marry a religious girl who prays and recites adhkaar but does not wear niqaab. What should he do?",
      "options": [
        "Marry her and educate her about Islamic rulings with patience, as many positive changes can occur after marriage through good treatment and a better environment",

      ],

A lot of positive change may come after marriage, especially if he treats her nicely and moves her into a better environment. There is no reason why a woman who loves her religion and is obedient to her husband should not respond to Allah's command regarding clothing. He should be patient with her and explain the ruling with evidence, using various means such as righteous friends, tapes, and books."

      "question": "Does swearing or using bad language invalidate wudu?",
      "options": [
        "Swearing does not break wudu, but it is recommended to perform wudu afterward as expiation for the sin",
        "Swearing invalidates wudu and the person must perform it again before praying",
        "Wudu must be repeated only if the swearing occurred during prayer",
        "Backbiting and slander break wudu, but other forms of bad speech do not"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Swearing is not one of the things that invalidate wudu. However, it is mustahabb (recommended) for one who commits a sin to do wudu, because wudu expiates for sins. Al-Nawawi stated that the correct view is that it is mustahabb to do wudu after saying bad words such as backbiting, lying, or slander for the purpose of expiation, but it is not obligatory. The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not obligatory to do wudu after saying bad words."

      "question": "If a Muslim woman displays her beauty (tabarruj) to non-mahram men while she has wudu, what is the effect on her wudu?",
      "options": [
        "The wudu remains valid but the woman has committed a prohibited act by displaying her beauty",
        "Displaying beauty invalidates wudu and requires it to be performed again",
        "The wudu is valid only if the beauty was displayed unintentionally",
        "Wudu becomes invalid only if the adornment is shown to non-mahram men for an extended period"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "What is required of the Muslim woman is to adhere to hijab as prescribed in Islamic teachings and not show her adornment to non-mahram men. However, if a woman displays her beauty and she has wudu, her wudu remains valid and it is not invalidated by that. She has committed a haraam action by displaying her beauty, but this does not affect the validity of her wudu."

      "question": "A Shi'a girl wants to marry but the Bohra group representative is preventing the marriage official from conducting her marriage contract. What is the Islamic ruling?",
      "options": [
        "If her blood guardians refuse to arrange her marriage, the Muslim judge can perform the marriage contract as the ruler is the guardian for one who has no guardian",
        "The Bohra representative's approval is required for any marriage contract to be valid",
        "She must wait until she turns 25 before she can marry without her guardian's consent",
        "The marriage can only be valid if performed by the Bohra-appointed official"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Guardians are obliged to arrange marriages if someone compatible proposes. If one of her guardians who is related to her arranges her marriage to a compatible person, the Bohra representative has no right to object and the marriage will be valid. If her relatives refuse to marry her to please the representative, their guardianship becomes invalid, and the Muslim judge (qaadi) has the right to do the marriage contract because the Prophet said: \"The ruler is the wali for the one who has no wali.\""

        "Yes, he saw Paradise during a solar eclipse prayer and stretched his hand toward its fruits, and also saw it during the Night Journey (Mi'raaj)",

        "He was shown a representation or image of Paradise but did not see the actual Paradise",
        "He described Paradise based on revelation but did not personally witness it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

During a solar eclipse, the Prophet prayed and said he saw Paradise and stretched his hand toward a bunch of its fruits. He also saw Hell at that time. Additionally, the Prophet saw Paradise in his dreams (and the dreams of Prophets are revelation and are true), and he saw Paradise on the night of the Mi'raaj when he witnessed the Sidrah covered with what it was covered with."
