      "question": "<p>What is your opinion on this hadeeth (prophetic narration)? It was narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Adam committed his sin, he said: ‘O Lord, I ask You by virtue of Muhammad to forgive me.’ Allah said: ‘O Adam, how do you know Muhammad when I have not created him yet?’ He said: ‘O Lord, because when You created me with Your hand and breathed into me the soul that You created for me, I lifted my head and I saw it written on the pillars of the Throne: La ilaha ill-Allah Muhammad Rasool Allah, and I knew that You would not attach to Your name any but the most beloved of creation to You.’ Allah said: ‘You have spoken the truth, O Adam, for he is the most beloved of creation to Me, and as you asked Me by virtue of him, I have forgiven you. Were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created you.’”</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    This     hadeeth is fabricated, as was explained by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may     Allah have mercy on him), because Allah only created the jinn and mankind to     worship Him alone with no partner or associate, and Adam (peace be upon him)     is one of mankind.

End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh     al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said concerning it in al-Tawassul (p.166):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was     narrated in marfoo’ (reports attributed directly to the Prophet) and mawqoof     (not directly attributed to the prophet but rather the Companion) reports     attributed to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), but (its     isnad/chain of transmission) includes ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Aslam, who is     da’eef according to their consensus and he makes many mistakes.

      "title": "She has a problem which means that her wudoo’ is broken constantly and the time for prayer ended whilst she was doing tawaaf and she did not repeat her wudoo’",
      "question": "<p>I am a person who has a problem which mean that my wudoo’ is broken constantly and I have to do wudoo’ for every prayer. During Hajj I reached the Haram when it was not the time for prayer, and I did wudoo' and started to do tawaaf. During tawaaf, the time for prayer began and I prayed without renewing my wudoo’, because of the severe crowding, then I completed tawaaf and saa’i. Is what I did correct?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    The woman who suffers istihaadah (ongoing irregular vaginal     bleeding) and the one who has a problem which means that he or she cannot     keep wudoo’&nbsp; has to do wudoo' at the time of every prayer according to the     majority of fuqaha’, and the end of the time for prayer invalidates wudoo'     in the case of such people. This applies only if something comes out; if     nothing comes out then the wudoo' remains valid and the person may offer the     following obligatory prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bahooti said in al-Rawdat al-Murbi’ (p. 57): The     woman who has istihaadah and people in similar situations such as those who     have urinary incontinence or continual madhiy or continual passing of wind     should do wudoo' when the time for each prayer begins if something has come     out, and they may pray both obligatory and supererogatory (naafil) prayers     so long as that time remains. So if nothing has come out then wudoo' is not     required. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The     woman who has istihaadah must do wudoo' for every prayer if something has     come out, but if nothing has come out then her first wudoo' remains valid.     End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (1/438).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you are not sure whether something came out from the time     you did wudoo' until the end of your tawaaf, then your tawaaf is valid and     you do not have to do anything. As for saa’i, it is not essential to be in a     state of purity for it, so if you did saa’i when you were not in a state of     purity, your saa’i is valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if you are certain that something came out after you did     wudoo', then you should have done wudoo' after the time for the new prayer     began in order for your tawaaf and prayer to be valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you did not do that, then your tawaaf is not valid     according to many of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But some of them are of the view that purity from minor     impurity is not essential for tawaaf, and if a person does tawaaf without     wudoo', his tawaaf is valid. This is the view of the Hanafis and was the     view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. It was also regarded as more     correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them). See the     answer to question number <a href=\"/en/answers/34695\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">34695</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this opinion, your tawaaf was valid and your Hajj     was valid, and you do not have to do anything, but you have to repeat the     prayer that you offered without having done wudoo'.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

And you (believers in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (peace and     blessings of Allah be upon him) were taught (through the Quran) that which     neither you nor your fathers knew.” Say: “Allah (sent it down).” Then leave     them to play in their vain discussions.”</p>\n<p>    [al-An‘am 6:91]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “They have not estimated Allah His Rightful Estimate. Verily,     Allah is All‑Strong, All‑Mighty.”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hajj 22:74]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to     Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped     by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified     be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!”</p>\n<p>    [al-Zumar 39:67].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:     “No one is more patient in bearing offensive things that he hears than     Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; others are associated with Him, a     son is attributed to Him, but He still grants them health and provision.”     Narrated by al-Bukhari (7378) and Muslim (2804).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we learn from this is that the criticism of the envious     and the slander of those with ulterior motives is not a reason for a Muslim     to be discouraged from trying hard to succeed and progress, or to weaken his     resolve or cause him to become frustrated. He should always remember that     Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, the Angels, the Messengers and the     Prophets were never safe from slander and harm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on offering congratulations on the occasion of ` `Eid? What is the ruling on shaking hands and embracing after the ` `Eid prayer?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It was narrated that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to congratulate one another <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/148039\" target=\"_blank\">on the occasion of `Eid</a> by saying Taqabbal Allahu minna wa minkum (May Allah accept (this worship) from us and from you).</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Jubayr ibn Nufayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met one another <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49014\" target=\"_blank\">on the day of `Eid</a> , they would say to one another: “Taqabbal Allahu minna wa mink (May Allah accept (this worship) from us and from you).” Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Its chain of narration is good.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is nothing wrong with one man saying to another on the day of `Eid: Taqabbal Allahu minna wa mink (May Allah accept (this worship) from us and from you).” This was narrated by Ibn Qudamah in Al-Mughni.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra (2/228): Does the common `Eid greeting that is on people`s lips – “ `Eid Mubarak” etc – have any basis in Shari`ah or not? If there is a basis for that in Shari`ah, what should we say?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/192665\" target=\"_blank\">greeting on the day of `Eid</a> , which people say to one another when meeting <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/48983\" target=\"_blank\">after the prayer</a> , “Taqabbal Allahu minna wa minkum wa ahalahu Allah `alayka (May Allah accept (this worship) from us and from you and may you live to see another `Eid)” etc, this was narrated from a number of the Companions who used to do that and allow others to do so too, and from the Imams such as Imam Ahmad. But Ahmad said: I do not initiate this greeting with anyone. But if someone greets me in this manner I return his greeting. That is because returning a greeting is obligatory, but initiating this greeting is not a Sunnah that is enjoined, but neither is it forbidden. The one who does it has an example (whom he imitated) and the one who does not do it also has an example (whom he imitated). And Allah knows best.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on offering `Eid greetings and is there a particular wording to be used?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is permissible to offer greetings and congratulations on `Eid, and there is no specific greeting. Rather the greetings that people customarily use are permissible so long as no sin is involved.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Some of the Companions offered greetings and congratulations on the occasion of `Eid. Even if we assume that they did not do that, it has now become something customary that people are used to doing, congratulating one another <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36442\" target=\"_blank\">on the occasion of `Eid</a> and on completing the fast and Qiyam.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And (may Allah have mercy on him) he was asked: what is the ruling on shaking hands, embracing and congratulating one another after the `Eid prayer?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with these things, because people do not do these things as acts of worship intended to draw them closer to Allah, rather they do them because they are customary, and to honour and show respect to one another. So long as there is nothing in Shari`ah to indicate that a custom is forbidden, then the basic principle is that it is permissible.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 16/208-210)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should two khutbahs be given on Eid or only one?",
      "question": "<p>What is the correct view concerning the Eid khutbah – should it be one khutbah or two? What is the evidence for that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The majority of scholars, of the four madhhabs and others, are of the view that two khutbahs should be given on Eid, and the imam should sit briefly between them, as is done in the Jumu’ah (Friday) khutbah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mudawwanah 1/231: Maalik said: In all khutbahs – the khutbah of the imam when praying for rain (istisqa’), the two Eids, the day of ‘Arafah and on Fridays – the imam should separate between the two khutbahs by sitting briefly. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Umm (1/272): It was narrated that ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah said: The Sunnah on Eid is for the imam to deliver two khutbahs, sitting briefly in between. Al-Shaafa’i said: that applies to the prayers for rain, the khutbah given during the eclipse prayer, the khutbah of Hajj, and every khutbah given to a congregation. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 1/276; al-Mughni, 2/121&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the report quoted above: The second hadeeth makes it more likely to be correct when we draw an analogy with Jumu’ah. ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah is a Taabi’i, as is well known, so his saying, “It is Sunnah” cannot be taken as evidence that it is the Sunnah of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as is stated in the usool. There is a marfoo’ hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah which speaks of sitting in between the two khutbahs of Eid, but its isnaad includes Isma’eel ibn Muslim, who is da’eef (weak). End quote from Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/323&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth of Ibn Maajah (1279) was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, who said: The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out on the day of Fitr or Adha and delivered a khutbah standing, then he sat for a while, then he stood up. This hadeeth was narrated by al-Albaani in Da’eef Ibn Maajah, where he said it is munkar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (4/4): al-Nawawi said in al-Khulaasah: the report narrated from Ibn Mas’ood, according to which he said, The Sunnah is for two khutbahs to be delivered on Eid, in between which the imam sits briefly, is da’eef and its isnaad is not uninterrupted. There is no proven report about giving more than one khutbah, and the evidence is analogy with Jumu’ah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may conclude from this the evidence which supports the idea of giving two khutbahs is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – The hadeeth of Ibn Maajah and the report of Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), both of which are da’eef, as stated above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – The report of ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah, who is a Taabi’i.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 –Analogy with Jumu’ah&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah be pleased with him) mentioned a fourth thing that may be quoted as evidence. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase ‘two khutbahs’ reflects the view of the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them), that there should be two khutbahs on Eid, because that was mentioned in a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah with his isnaad, which requires further examination. The apparent meaning is that two khutbahs should be given, but whoever examines the Sunnah in agreed-upon reports in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere will see that the Prophet&nbsp;(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only gave one khutbah, but after he had finished the first khutbah, he went to the women and exhorted them. If we take this as the basic principle concerning it being prescribed to give two khutbahs, then it is possible, although it is unlikely, because he went to the women and addressed them because they could not hear the khutbah. This is possible. And it may be possible that they could hear his words, but he wanted to address them specifically, hence he reminded them and exhorted them concerning matters that pertained specifically to them. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/191.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee was asked: Should the imam sit between the two khutbahs of Eid?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: The two khutbahs of Eid are Sunnah and come after the Eid prayer, because of the report narrated by al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Maajah and Abu Dawood, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I attended Eid prayer with the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When he had finished praying he said: “We will deliver a khutbah; whoever wishes to sit and listen to the khutbah, let him do so, and whoever wants to leave, let him do so.” Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Nayl: al-Musannif (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This shows that the khutbah is Sunnah; it is were obligatory, it would be obligatory to sit and listen to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is prescribed for the one who delivers two khutbahs on Eid to separate them by sitting briefly, by analogy with the two khutbahs of Jumu’ah, and because of the report narrated by al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) from ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: The Sunnah is for the Imam to deliver two khutbahs on Eid, sitting briefly in between them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars are of the view that there is only one khutbah for Eid prayer, because the saheeh ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) speak of only one khutbah. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/425&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Should the imam deliver one khutbah or two on Eid?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: The well known view among the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) is that there should be two khutbahs on Eid, because of a da’eef hadeeth which was narrated concerning that, but in the hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, it says that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only delivered one khutbah. I hope that the matter is flexible. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/246&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said (16/248):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sunnah is for there to be one khutbah, but if two khutbahs are given that is fine, because it was narrated that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also did that. But the imam should not forget to exhort the women in particular, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is speaking via a microphone and the women can hear him, he should devote the end of his khutbah to exhorting the women in particular. If he is not using a microphone and the women cannot hear him, then he should go to them, accompanied by one or two other men, and say a few words to them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion: This is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, and it is flexible. There is no definitive text in the Sunnah concerning this matter, although it seems that it should be one khutbah. Let the imam do whatever he thinks is closest to the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I work in the education field, and sometimes we hear that someone has died; they may be colleagues in the same school board in which I work, or relatives of colleagues. We know when and where the funeral prayer will be offered for them, so I go to the mosque specifically to offer the prayer for them, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise, whether the deceased was a man or a woman or a relative of our colleagues. I think that this is their right over us. Is there anything wrong with that? Because one of my colleagues asked me to find out, and if what I am doing is good, they will follow my example, and if what I am doing is an innovation (bid‘ah) I will stop doing it.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is permissible for women to go to the mosque to offer the funeral prayer, because there is no religious text which forbids doing that.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Offering the funeral prayer is prescribed for both men and women, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral until the prayer has been offered [for the deceased] will have one qiraat [of reward], and whoever attends until the deceased is buried will have two qiraats.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the two qiraats? He said: “Like two great mountains,” referring to reward. Its soundness is agreed upon. But women should not follow the funeral procession to the graveyard, for they are not allowed to do that, because of the report in <em>as-Saheehayn</em> from Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: We were forbidden to follow the bier but not emphatically.” With regard to offering the funeral prayer for the deceased, women were not forbidden to do that, whether the prayer is offered in the mosque or at home or in the prayer place. The women used to attend the funeral prayers in the mosque with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and after his time.</p>\n<p>As for visiting graves, that is only for men, as is also the case with following the bier to the graveyard, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves.\"(<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp;13/134).</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: With regard to this hadith that the questioner mentioned – “Women have no share of the funeral” – we do not know of any basis for it, and we do not know any of the scholars who narrated it. Rather what was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) regarding this matter is that he cursed the women who visit graves and those who build places of worship and install lamps over them, and he forbade women to follow the bier – i.e., to the graveyard. As for offering the funeral prayer with the people in the mosque or the prayer place, it is something that is prescribed for everyone. The women used to offer the obligatory prayer and funeral prayer with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) attended the funeral prayer for Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) in the mosque of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\"(<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp; 13/135-136).</p>\n<p>Based on that, there is nothing wrong with you going out to offer the funeral prayer in the mosque, when you are able to do so and that does not involve any other reprehensible actions such as panicking or wailing, or causing any fitnah.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>There is nothing wrong with using what you mention, so long as none of it reaches the throat; rather you should spit out whatever of it is left in the mouth, or <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/14065\" target=\"_blank\">rinse out the mouth</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: In some pharmacies, there is a kind of fragrance for the mouth, which is a type of spray. Is it permissible to use it during the day in Ramadan to remove odour from the mouth?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Instead of using the spray for the mouth when fasting, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/108014\" target=\"_blank\">it is sufficient to use the Siwak</a> which was encouraged by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). If the spray is used and none of it reaches the throat, there is nothing wrong with it. But the smell that comes from the mouth of the fasting person as a result of fasting should not be disliked, because it is the effect of obedience and is beloved by Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the Hadith it says: “The smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk.” &nbsp;(Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, 3/121)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39017\" target=\"_blank\">39017</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/78438\" target=\"_blank\">78438</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/129903\" target=\"_blank\">129903</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Dividing Qiyaam al-layl into two parts during the last ten days of Ramadan",
      "question": "<p>I hope that you could tell me about the opinions of the scholars with regard to the ruling on dividing Taraweeh prayers in the last ten days of Ramadan into two parts: at the beginning of the night and at the end, as is done in many mosques. Please also mention the evidence if possible.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What is mustahabb during the nights of Ramadan is to spend them in qiyaam, prayer and worship, and to single out the last ten nights for extra worship and striving, seeking forgiveness and mercy and seeking Laylat al-Qadr which is better than a thousand months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, Taraaweeh prayer is regarded as a kind of Qiyaam al-layl and they call it Taraweeh because people take brief breaks between rak’ahs. Hence the matter is broad in scope, and it is permissible for a person to pray whatever he wants of rak’ahs, at whatever time of the night he wants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/123):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ with regard to it being Sunnah to pray during the nights of Ramadan (Qiyaam al-layl), because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the nights of Ramadan in prayer, out of faith and seeking the reward of Allah, his previous sins will be forgiven.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fuqaha’ said: Taraweeh is the qiyaam (Qiyaam al-layl) of Ramadan. Hence it is best to spend most of the night in it, because it is Qiyaam al-layl. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What many imams do nowadays -- especially in the last ten days of Ramadan -- leading the people in Taraweeh prayer immediately after ‘Isha’, then going back to the mosque in the last part of the night to pray qiyaam, is something that is prescribed and it is not forbidden. There is no reason to suggest it is not allowed. What is required is to strive hard in the last ten days according to one's ability. If a person breaks up his night between prayer, resting, sleeping, and reading Qur'aan, then he has done well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah Abaabateen said, as is narrated in al-Durar al-Saniyyah (4/364):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In response to what some people do of objecting to the one who prays more during the last ten days of Ramadan than he usually did in the first twenty days, on the grounds that this is more than is usual and is ignorance of the Sunnah and the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and imams of Islam,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We say: There are hadeeths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which encourage praying Qiyaam al-layl during Ramadan, and particularly emphasise it during the last ten days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once it becomes clear that there is no specific number of rak’ahs for Taraweeh, and that the time for it according to all scholars is from after the Sunnah of ‘Isha’ until the break of dawn, and that spending the night in worship is a confirmed Sunnah, and that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) prayed taraweeh for many nights in congregation, then how can anyone object to the one who prays more during the last ten nights than he did at the beginning of the month? So during the last ten days, he prays at the beginning of the night, as he did at the beginning of the month, or a little, or a lot, without praying Witr, for the sake of those who are weak and want to limit themselves to that; then after that he does more prayers in congregation and calls all of it qiyaam or taraweeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the one who objects to that is confused by what many of the fuqaha’ say, that it is mustahabb for the imam not to pray more than one includes than one khatmah (reading of the entire Qur’aan), unless the people behind him prefer to do more than that. The reason they gave for not doing more than one khatmah is the hardship that may be caused for the people behind him, not because doing more than that is not prescribed in sharee’ah. So from their wording we may conclude that if people behind him want to do more than one khatmah, that is good, as was clearly stated in the words of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for what many of the common people say, calling what is done at the beginning of the night Taraweeh and the prayers offered after that qiyaam, this is what the uneducated people say. Rather all of it is qiyaam and taraweeh. The qiyaam of Ramadaan is called Taraweeh because they used to have a rest (yastareehoona) after every four rak’ahs because they used to make the prayers lengthy. The reason why some people object to that is that it is contrary to what is customary among the people of their countries and most of the people nowadays; and because of ignorance of the Sunnah and reports and of the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi’oon and the imams of Islam; and because of what some people think, that our prayer during the last ten days is a kind of salat al-ta’qeeb which was regarded as makrooh by some scholars, but that is not in fact the case, because ta’qeeb is a voluntary prayer offered in congregation after finishing Taraweeh and Witr.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is how all the fuqaha’ defined ta’qeeb, as a voluntary prayer offered in congregation after finishing Witr immediately after Taraweeh. From these words it is clear that prayer offered in congregation before Witr is not ta’qeeb. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said in Ithaaf Ahl al-Eemaan bi Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the last ten days of Ramadan, the Muslims increase their efforts in worship, following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking Laylat al-Qadr which is better than a thousand months. Those who pray twenty-three rak’ahs at the beginning of the month break it up during the last ten days, so they pray ten rak’ahs at the beginning of the night, calling it Taraweeh, and they pray ten at the end of the night, making them lengthy, and following it with three rak’ahs of Witr, which they call qiyaam. This is a variation in naming only. In fact all of it may be called Taraweeh or it may be called qiyaam. As for those who pray eleven or thirteen rak’ahs at the beginning of the month, they add ten rak’ahs to that during the last ten days, which they pray at the end of the night, making it lengthy, making the most of the virtue of the last ten days and increasing their efforts to do good. They have a precedent among the Sahaabah and others who prayed twenty-three rak’ahs, as stated above. Thus they combine the two opinions: the opinion which favours offering thirteen rak’ahs during the first twenty days and the opinion which favours offering twenty-three during the last ten days.

      "question": "<p>Who inherits from a man who leaves behind no father, mother, wife or children, but he has nieces who are the daughters of a deceased full brother, and he has nephews and nieces who are the sons and daughters of deceased full sisters, and he has a paternal cousin, and his paternal uncle is also deceased. Is this a case of kalalah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This case is a case of kalalah. What is meant by kalalah is when a man dies and does not leave behind parents or children who could inherit from him.\"(A<em>n-Nihayah fi Gharib al-Hadith wa’l-Athar</em>&nbsp; 4/197).</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/185972\" target=\"_blank\">185972</a> .</p>\n<p>As there is no heir who would inherit an allocated share of the estate in this case, the entire estate goes to the paternal cousin, because he is the only ‘asib [male relative on the father’s side]. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give the allocated shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them, and whatever is left over goes to the closest male relative who has no allocated share.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6732).</p>\n<p>This paternal cousin is the closest male relative. As for the daughters of his brother, and the sons and daughters of his sisters, they do not inherit anything, because they come under the heading of dhawi’l-arham (relatives who do not receive any share of the inheritance). According to the view that they may inherit, they only inherit when there are no heirs who are entitled to allocated shares and no male relatives on the father’s side, and this condition is not met in this case, because of the presence of the male relative on the father’s side, namely the son of the paternal uncle.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My father took out a loan with a bank guarantee certificate to pay off the balance owed by my brother for his apartment, but no one except me can pay off the monthly instalments on the loan. My father agreed with me that I should pay the instalment on the loan every month, in return for him giving me the amount mentioned in the certificate when the loan is paid off. I objected to the interest mentioned in the certificate, but he told me that I will take the original amount mentioned in the certificate, and I do not have anything to do with any extra amount or interest. Please note that the original amount mentioned in the certificate will be mine. Is there any sin on me at present, because I am paying off the loan?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Taking out loans with interest from the bank is haram, because it comes under the heading of riba (usury), for which Allah has warned those who deal with it of war, and He has warned them of punishment for it, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.</p>\n<p>And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged}&nbsp;[al-Baqarah 2:279-279].</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The investment certificates that the banks issue in your country are also haram, and they are not free of riba, such as Group A and Group B certificates; or they are not free of both riba and gambling, such as Group C certificates.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/72413\" target=\"_blank\">72413</a> .</p>\n<p>What you must do is two things:</p>\n<p>1. Repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from getting involved in haram certificates.</p>\n<p>2. Get rid of the certificates, by taking the capital and giving the interest (riba) to charitable causes that serve the interests of the Muslims.</p>\n<p>What your father must do is repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from taking out a riba-based loan.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with you paying off your father’s loan, because the principal of this riba-based loan has to be paid off. The same applies to the interest, if there is no way to avoid it. There is nothing wrong with helping your father to get rid of his debt.</p>\n<p>But what is wrong in your case is keeping the riba-based certificate. If you are able to cancel it, you must do that, even if that leads to not paying off your father’s debt, because you are not obliged to do that according to Islamic teachings.</p>\n<p>But if you are not able to cancel it, because it was taken in pledge for the loan, then there is no blame on you, and you can carry on paying off your father’s debt.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
