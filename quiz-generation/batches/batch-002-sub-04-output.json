      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on giving zakaah (obligatory charity) to people who are strong and able to earn a living but refuse work?",
      "options": [
        "Zakaah cannot be given to those who are strong and able to earn, as the Prophet said there is no share of zakaah for one who is able to earn a living",
        "Zakaah may be given to anyone who asks for it regularly, regardless of their ability to work",
        "Both zakaah and voluntary charity must only be given to those who are completely unable to work",
        "Zakaah can be given to able-bodied people if they have become accustomed to receiving monthly charity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace be upon him) explicitly stated: 'There is no share of it [zakaah] for the one who is independent of means or one who is strong and able to earn a living' (narrated by Abu Dawood, 1633). However, voluntary (mustahabb) charity may be given to both poor and rich, though it is better to give it to those in need. This is the clear distinction made in Islamic law between obligatory and voluntary charity."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on naming a child 'Rukaan'?",
      "options": [
        "There is nothing wrong with the name Rukaan unless it is proven to be a gate of Hell, in which case it becomes makrooh (disliked)",
        "The name Rukaan is confirmed as one of the gates of Hell and is therefore completely forbidden",
        "Only the spelling 'Rukaanah' is permissible in Islam, not 'Rukaan'",
        "All traditional Arab names like Rukaan are automatically acceptable regardless of their meanings or associations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Scholars have stated that there is nothing wrong with calling a child Rukaan, as it is among recognized Arab names (including Rukaan, Rukaanah and Rakeen). The claim that it is a gate of Hell has not been verified. However, if it were proven to be the name of a gate of Hell, then it would become makrooh (disliked) to use this name, following the Islamic principle of choosing good and appropriate names for children."

      "question": "According to Islamic belief, what happens if the Prophet (peace be upon him) made an incorrect decision in religious matters?",
      "options": [
        "Revelation would come down immediately to correct it and show Allah's ruling, as proven in Quranic passages about prisoners at Badr and other incidents",
        "The Prophet could make permanent errors in religious rulings without any divine correction being necessary",
        "Such mistakes would be corrected only after his death by the consensus of scholars",
        "Following the Prophet's rulings is recommended but not obligatory, so errors would not require correction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in religious matters is infallible because if he made a decision based on personal opinion that was incorrect, revelation would come down straightaway to correct it. This is proven in the Quran through passages such as the verses about prisoners at Badr (Al-Anfal 8:67-69), asking forgiveness for polytheists (At-Tawbah 9:113-114), and prohibiting what Allah made lawful (At-Tahrim 66:1-2). This demonstrates the divine protection of his religious teachings."

      "question": "Under what conditions is hemp protein permissible to consume according to Islamic ruling?",
      "options": [
        "If derived from seeds or leaves not attached to flowering tops, which are free of THC according to the 1961 Narcotic Drugs Convention",
        "All parts of the hemp plant contain THC and are therefore completely forbidden for consumption",
        "Only protein extracted from the flowering and fruiting tops of hemp is permissible",
        "Hemp protein is permissible only if derived from male cannabis plants, not female plants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The psychoactive substance THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is only present in the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant, not in the seeds or leaves. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 explicitly excludes seeds and leaves (when not attached to the tops) from the definition of prohibited 'cannabis.' Therefore, protein derived from these THC-free parts of the plant is permissible, provided it has no other harmful effects on the body."

      "question": "What should a Muslim do who swore to give his hijrah (migration) money to charity if he committed a sin, but then committed the sin again?",
      "options": [
        "Proceed with migration, offer expiation (kaffarah) for breaking the oath, and use the money for hijrah since its benefit outweighs the oath",
        "Give all the migration money to charity because breaking an oath is never permissible under any circumstances in Islam",
        "Delay migration indefinitely until new money is raised, as keeping the oath takes absolute precedence",
        "Keep the money without expiation since oaths made in desperation are automatically void"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Islamic law prescribes that when someone swears an oath and then sees something better, they should do what is better and offer expiation for the oath. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Whoever swears an oath then sees that something else is better than it, let him do that and offer expiation for his oath' (Muslim 1650). Migration to a Muslim land and its benefits take precedence over maintaining the oath, so he should offer kaffarah yameen (expiation) and proceed with hijrah."

      "question": "What is the ruling for a man with low sexual desire who wishes to marry?",
      "options": [
        "He may marry if he can have intercourse even once every month or two, but complete inability must be disclosed to the woman's guardian beforehand",
        "Any degree of sexual difficulty or low desire automatically prevents marriage according to Islamic law",
        "Low desire requires ability to have intercourse at least once per week for marriage to be permissible",
        "Complete inability to have intercourse need not be disclosed before marriage as it may resolve itself"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "According to Shaykh Ibn Jibreen's fatwa, if a man has any sexual desire at all, even if little, he may get married. It is sufficient to be able to have intercourse even once every month or two months, as there are natural variations in desire among people. However, if there is complete inability to have intercourse, Islamic law requires that this must be clearly disclosed to the woman's guardian before the marriage contract takes place, to ensure transparency and informed consent."

      "question": "What is the correct procedure when buying gold from a craftsman who will also make it into jewellery?",
      "options": [
        "The price of the gold must be paid immediately in cash and possession taken in one sitting, but the cost of crafting may be delayed",
        "Both the gold price and the crafting fee must be paid immediately in the same sitting to avoid riba",
        "The gold price can be delayed as a debt, but the crafting fee must be paid up front",
        "Exchanging old gold for new gold with an added crafting fee is permissible as long as the exchange happens in one sitting"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Based on the hadith 'Gold for gold, silver for silver... like for like, same for same, hand to hand,' the price of gold must be paid in cash with immediate possession in one sitting to avoid riba. However, as Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen explained, the cost of making gold into jewellery is payment for work (labor), not an exchange of gold for gold, so this fee does not have to be paid up front and may be delayed. Mixing gold exchange with a labor fee as a single deferred payment would constitute riba."

      "question": "According to the tafsir of Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:7-10), what is the status of those who are 'foremost' on the Day of Resurrection?",
      "options": [
        "They will be the first to enter Paradise, closest to Allah in the heights of 'Illiyeen, in a lofty status above which there is no higher",
        "They will be among those on the Right Hand who receive their records and enter Paradise after accountability",
        "They will form a fourth separate group distinct from the three divisions mentioned in the verses",
        "They will serve as witnesses over the other two groups before entering Paradise themselves"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The tafsir explains that those who were foremost in doing good deeds in this world will be foremost (first) in the Hereafter. They will be the first to enter Paradise and will be the closest to Allah in gardens of delight, in the heights of 'Illiyeen, occupying the loftiest status with no higher status above it. This distinguishes them as the highest rank among the three groups mentioned in the verses, above even the general 'people of the Right Hand.'"

      "question": "When is an agent (wakeel) liable for the loss of items entrusted to his care, such as a watch in luggage?",
      "options": [
        "Only if the loss was due to heedlessness, such as leaving the bag unattended in a vulnerable location or not standing over it in baggage claim",
        "Agents are always liable for any loss of items entrusted to them, regardless of the circumstances or their level of care",
        "The buyer must pay the full remaining amount to the agent even if the agent left the bag completely unguarded",
        "An agent who forgets to list an item on airport loss forms is automatically considered negligent and fully liable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Islamic law establishes that a wakeel (agent) is a trustee who is not liable for loss or destruction unless there is deliberate transgression or negligence. As Ibn Qudaamah stated, 'The agent is a trustee; he is not liable for the loss or destruction of anything entrusted to his care if he is not negligent.' Therefore, liability depends on whether the loss resulted from heedlessness (like leaving a bag where it was vulnerable to theft) or occurred despite proper care. The scholars advise that parties reach a mutually acceptable agreement when circumstances are unclear."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on investing in bitcoin according to the scholars' assessment?",
      "options": [
        "The ruling cannot be determined because bitcoin's source is unknown and surrounded by mystery, so investment is not advised until its true nature is revealed",
        "Bitcoin is clearly halal since many major companies have begun to recognize and deal in it",
        "Bitcoin is definitively haram due to its purely digital nature and lack of any physical commodity backing",
        "Muslims may freely invest in bitcoin as long as they avoid using it for transactions involving riba or prohibited goods"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The scholars stated that bitcoin's source remains unknown and it is surrounded by mystery, problems, fears and dangers. Because the facts of the matter are not clear and it is not known who is behind it, they are unable to issue a definitive fatwa concerning it. Therefore, they advise against investing in it until its true nature becomes apparent. This represents a cautious approach based on insufficient information rather than a definitive ruling of halal or haram."
