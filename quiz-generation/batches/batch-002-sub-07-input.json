      "title": "Ruling on playing with ouija boards",
      "question": "<p>I recently found out about a game that is very common in our country, which is called Ouija. Does this game come under the heading of witchcraft and interacting with the jinn?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The ouija board game poses a danger to the religious commitment and life of the player. With regard to his religious commitment, that is because it involves calling upon and addressing the jinn, responding to them, believing their words, and being afraid of going against their orders. The ruling on playing this game is no different than the ruling on going to fortune tellers and soothsayers, because of what happens of the player asking the jinn about matters that are unseen or unknown to him. With regard to the danger that it poses to his life, that is because of what has happened of many people being affected by mental illness, anxiety and fear that ruined their lives. Hence there have been many statements from psychologists and there is unanimous agreement on the necessity of getting rid of this game and not trying it out, let alone playing it and becoming attached to it.</p>\n<p>In brief, it consists of a board on which are written all the numbers and letters, and at the top of the board are written the words Yes, No, and Goodbye. Each board is written in the language of the local people and there is a disc in the middle of the board, the edges of which are held by a minimum of two players. The game begins by calling upon “Ouija”, and it is clear in the minds of the players that they are now calling upon a spirit or a jinn, according to the player’s belief, and he is asked about things that are unknown to them of events that have taken place, and the disc moves towards the numbers and letters in order to spell out the answer to the question. If the question is about a specific date, the disc, with their fingers on it, moves towards the numbers in order to answer the question. Similarly, if the question is about a name or an event, then the disc moves towards the letters in order to spell out the answer to the question. Or the answer may be Yes or No, so the disc moves towards one of them. The players cannot choose to exit the game until they ask permission from “Ouija”, then if the disk moves towards the word No, they cannot leave the game, but if it moves towards the word Yes, then they can leave, whereupon they have to thank him, then when the players have thanked him, the disc moves towards the word Goodbye.</p>\n<p>Some people try to take the matter lightly and make it merely a game for fun, but in fact it is extremely serious. What appears to be the case is that the word “Ouija” is the name of one of the jinn – a king or someone else– and he sends one of his troops to move the disk towards the numbers and letters to spell out the answers. There are some people who believe that this movement comes from the devil-companions (qareen) of the players, and that what they ask about is known to them only or is known in the realm of the jinn. There are others – Western doctors and scientists – who believe that the phenomenon of the disk’s movement is what is called “unconscious movement”; what is meant is that the mind is able, under the influence of certain emotions, to move the muscles of the body unconsciously, without the individual being aware of this movement, so it appears to him as if the spirits are moving the pointer under his hand.</p>\n<p>What is established in the mind of the Muslim is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade going to soothsayers and said that “they are nothing.” And he said that if a person goes to them, even if he does not believe in them, then no prayer will be accepted from him for forty days, and that whoever goes to them and believes in them has committed an act of disbelief.</p>\n<p>We have discussed all of this – with the relevant evidence – in the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8291\">8291</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60431\">60431</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for the Muslim to seek the help of the jinn to find out unknown and unseen matters, even if he does not seek to draw close to them by doing acts of worship or obedience to them. Merely seeking their help is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Because the jinn benefit from the humans who play this game, the jinn submit, in a sense, to the players, by telling them the unknown matters they ask about. The human also submits to the jinn in a sense. It is sufficient to note that they dare not leave the game without seeking the permission of “Ouija”, otherwise they think and believe that they will be harmed. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinns! Many did you mislead of men,’ and their Auliya (friends and helpers, etc.) amongst men will say: ‘Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us’” [al-An‘aam 6:128]. The sin and disbelief that affect the player before and during the game, and afterwards, is what Allah, may He be exalted, mentions in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the jinns, but they (jinns) increased them (mankind) in sin and disbelief” [al-Jinn 72:6].</p>\n<p>With regard to the ruling on seeking the help of the jinn, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11114\">11114</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/78546\">78546</a>.</p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>It is haraam for the Muslim to play the Ouija board game, even if in fact it involves no more than unconscious movements, because the player actually and intentionally calls upon the jinn, which comes under the heading of seeking the help of the jinn and the ruling on going to fortune tellers and soothsayers. All of these are haraam things. We have discussed this above and in the answers referred to.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Woman working in a home for the elderly",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for a women to work in a home for the elderly that is mixed, men and women together, where the workers have to wash the people, both men and women, and change their diapers, or she may have to give them forbidden drinks and meals containing pork? Can a Muslim woman work in this place if she avoids giving the people alcohol and haram meats? Also please note that she is not allowed to wear anything but a scarf on her head and a knee-length shirt over trousers, on grounds of necessity. Some people have told the women that doing this kind of work is better than being dependent on the social agencies that offer help to families whose head is out of work.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>With regard to offering alcohol and pork to the residents of the home for the elderly, this is undoubtedly haram, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to alcohol, including the one who carries it and the one who pours it. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to wine: the one who presses (the grapes), the one for whom it is pressed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it and consumes its price, the one who buys it and the one for whom it is bought.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1295; Abu Dawood, 3674). So it is not permissible to carry it or serve it and to be paid for that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah forbids people to eat something, He also forbids its price to them [i.e., they are not allowed to sell it].” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani – may Allah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 2978).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also well known that alcohol and pork are forbidden in the Qur’aan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There remain two further issues of concern:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first is that the Muslim woman who works in this home is not wearing complete shar’i hijaab.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second is that washing the elderly people and changing their diapers will lead to seeing and touching their ‘awrahs. This is permissible in cases of necessity, but I do not think they will appoint men to take care of men and women to take care of women; usually they bring all the people together in one place and both women and men work with both sexes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So my advice is that a Muslim woman, in particular, should not work in this place. This work is also not desirable because it involves dealing with impure things. Accepting help from the social institution, even though it involves the humiliation of the Muslim taking aid from the kaafirs, is still easier to bear that this work which involves going against sharee’ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to cause Islam and the Muslims to prevail. And Allah is the Source of help.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible for the husband’s brother to take his brother’s wife to the doctor?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for the husband’s brother to take his brother’s wife to the doctor, if his brother is not there, or if he cannot be there, and the hospital is in the same city?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is not permissible for the wife to travel in a car alone     with her husband’s brother, because that comes under the heading of khulwah     (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) which the Messenger      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against when he said:     “Beware of entering upon women.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what     about the in-law?” He said: “The in-law is death.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari     and Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What do you understand from these words? Is it forbidden or     allowed? Undoubtedly what is meant is that it is forbidden and not allowed.     So it is not permissible for a man to be alone with his brother’s wife,     either in a car or in the house. Worse than that is what some people do when     a guest comes when the man is at work, and there is no one in the house     except his wife, then she opens the door to him and he goes in and waits for     the owner of the house to come home. The point is that it is not permissible     for any woman to be alone with any man (i.e., non mahrams) even if he is one     of her husband’s relatives or one of her relatives or neighbours, unless she     has a mahram with her, whether that is in her home town or when travelling.     It should also be noted that it is haraam for her to travel even if there is     no khulwah, if she does not have a mahram with her, because of the hadeeth     of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) which is narrated in     al-Saheehayn. He said: I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) delivered a khutbah and said: “No man should be alone     with a woman unless there is a mahram with her, and no woman should travel     without a mahram.”&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "When he recites a verse during prayer he translates the meaning into his language in his mind",
      "question": "<p>I would recite a verse in prayer and then after that I would say what the verse means in English(to understand), is this permissible?<br />\n<br />\n(sometimes I say it in my heart.) For example, I would recite the first verse of Surah Fatiha, then after this I would say: \"All praise is due to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the Worlds.\" Is this right, or permissible?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      There is nothing wrong with it if you recite a verse of the       Qur’aan during your prayer and ponder its meaning in your own language,       and say that to yourself as you mentioned in the example. This comes under       the heading of pondering and thinking of the meaning. That is on condition       that you do not utter it out loud, because the one who is praying is       forbidden to speak during the prayer, based on the report narrated by       Muslim (537) from Mu‘aawiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Sulmi who said: Whilst I was       praying with the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon       him), a man among the people sneezed and I said: Yarhamuk Allaah       (may Allah have mercy on you). The people glared at me and I said: May my       mother be bereft of me! Why are you staring at me? They started striking       their hands on their thighs, and when I realized that they were telling me       to be quiet, (I felt angry) but I kept quiet. When the Messenger of Allaah       (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had prayed – may my father and       mother be sacrificed for him; by Allaah I have never seen a better teacher       or better teachings before or since; he did not rebuke me, hit me or       revile me – he said: “This prayer is not the right place for any of the       people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, takbeer and recitation of Qur’aan,”       or words to that effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And because it is not permissible to recite Qur’aan in any     language other than Arabic.

      "title": "Is Al-Fatihah Part of the Funeral Prayer?",
      "question": "<p>What is the status/class of Hadith: Nafi` reported that Abdullah Ibn Umar did not use to recite (Fatihah) over the dead person. (Muwatta Imam Malik)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This report is of the highest degree of soundness. Imam Malik narrated it in Al-Muwatta’ (535) from Nafi` from Ibn `Umar, and this is what some of the scholars called As-silsilah Al-dhahabiyyah (the golden chain), which is the soundest, or one of the soundest, of Isnads (chains of narration).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wording is: It was narrated from Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) that `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did not <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9304\" target=\"_blank\">recite in the funeral prayer</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The meaning of the phrase “did not recite” is that he did not recite the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/132386\" target=\"_blank\">Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah)</a> or anything else. This is one of the well-known topics of dispute among the scholars. Some of them are of the view that it is a pillar or essential part of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/35853\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> , and others are of the view that it is not a pillar or even recommended. Others adopt a middle view and say that it is recommended but not obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) who said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The scholars differed concerning recitation of the Quran in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/90030\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> . There are three views.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was said that it is not recommended under any circumstances, as is the view of Abu Hanifah and Malik.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And it was that it is obligatory to recite <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147645\" target=\"_blank\">Al-Fatihah</a> , as is the view of some of the companions of Al-Shafi`i and Ahmad.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And it was said that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/315345\" target=\"_blank\">reciting Al-Fatihah</a> in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/162515\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> is Sunnah, but not reciting it and saying Du`a’ without reciting is permissible. This is the correct view.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 2/121)&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It seems – and true knowledge belongs to Allah – that reciting Al-Fatihah is a pillar or essential part of the funeral prayer. This comes under the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no prayer for the one <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10995\" target=\"_blank\">who does not recite the Opening of the Book</a> .” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 714; Muslim, 595). Perhaps because Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) held this view, Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) used to recite it out loud sometimes, although the Sunnah is to recite it quietly, in order to demonstrate that it should be recited in the funeral prayer. He was asked about that and he said: “So that you will know that it is Sunnah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1249)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>His saying that it is Sunnah does not mean that it is recommended, rather what he means is that it was the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/231217\" target=\"_blank\">Al-Fatihah</a> is a pillar or essential part of the funeral prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book,” and the funeral prayer is a prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies” [At-Tawbah 9:84].&nbsp; So Allah calls it a prayer. And Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) recited Al-Fatihah in the funeral prayer, and said: “So that you will know that it is Sunnah.”&nbsp;(Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 5/401)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on reciting Al-Fatihah in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12363\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> ? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is obligatory, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp; “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Majmu` Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 13/143)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Our religion says that if the husband calls his wife for intercourse, she must respond to his request. What if he calls her to play with him; does the wife also have to obey him in that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the husband calls his wife for intercourse, she must obey him in that. The same applies if he calls her to play with him; she must also obey him, as this is something that helps to perpetuate love and harmony between them.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (2097) and Muslim (715) narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Have you got married?” He said: Yes. He said: “A virgin or a previously-married woman?” He said: A previously-married woman. He said: “Why not a young girl, whom you could play with and she could play with you?”…</p>\n<p>Ahmad (16886) and Abu Dawud (2513) narrated that `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Anything a man does to entertain himself is pointless, except three things: shooting arrows, training his horse, and playing with his wife; these actions are valid and purposeful.”</p>\n<p>It says in <em>al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em> (35/337):</p>\n<p>The hadith indicates that everything a man does to entertain himself which does not benefit him in this life or the hereafter in a religious sense is pointless and objectionable, except these three actions. That is because, if he does them for the purpose of entertaining himself, comforting himself and energizing himself, it is valid, as there is benefit in them. Shooting arrows and training horses help a man to develop fighting skills, and playing with his wife could lead to the birth of a child who will testify to Allah’s oneness and worship Him. That is why these three actions are valid and purposeful, and all others are pointless.</p>\n<p>Al-Khattabi said: This confirms that all forms of entertainment are disallowed, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only exempted these three forms of entertainment from those that are prohibited, because, if you think about it, each one of them is beneficial or leads to something beneficial. End quote.</p>\n<p>One of the most important and sublime rights that the husband has over his wife is the obligation for her to obey him in everything that he tells her to do of things that are right and proper.</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (2140) narrated from Qays ibn Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to instruct anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have instructed women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the rights that Allah has given the husbands over them.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in <em>Sahih Abi Dawud</em>.</p>\n<p>So if a man calls his wife to play with him, she must obey him in that, and that is for several reasons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The obligation to obey him in what is right and proper, and this comes under the heading of what is right and proper.</li>\n<li>Obeying him in that is a means of attaining something that is obligatory, which is keeping him chaste.</li>\n<li>Obeying him in that is a means of fulfilling objectives of marriage such as harmony between the spouses and producing offspring.</li>\n<li>Her playing with him is one of the duties that the Lawgiver has recommended and enjoined.</li>\n<li>If that does not happen, it will create resentment and grudges between them, and the husband will be angry with his wife, as a result of which she will be exposed to the wrath of Allah, may He be Exalted.</li>\n<li>If that does not happen when he asks for it and she refuses, he will feel upset and will feel humiliated and looked down upon, which could result in him not seeking intimacy with her and avoiding her altogether.</li>\n<li>Islam enjoins everything that will increase love between spouses and forbids everything that will spoil the relationship between them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if the wife does not obey her husband when he calls her to play with him, that is contrary to what Islam has enjoined upon her and encouraged her to do.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The workers who are paid wages in return for their work in the factory and on the farm are the ones who should pay zakaat al-fitr for themselves, because the basic principle is that it is obligatory upon them.

      "title": "If a person wakes up junub and fears that the time for prayer may end if he does ghusl, should he do tayammum?",
      "question": "<p>If a man wakes up junub at the time when the iqaamah for Fajr prayer is being given, and if he does ghusl he will miss the prayer in congregation, can he do wudu and pray in the mosque with the congregation, then when he goes home he can do ghusl and pray two rak’ahs of Fajr, or should he do ghusl even if he will miss the prayer in congregation?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The person who is junub is required to do ghusl in order to pray, and his prayer is not valid if he only does wudu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He has to do ghusl even if he is afraid that the time for prayer in congregation will end, and even if he wakes up late and is afraid that the time for prayer will end if he does ghusl. The majority of scholars are of the view – which is the correct view – that he is obliged to do ghusl, because he is excused (with regard to the prayer).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his case the time that counts is the time that he woke up, because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (177), al-Nasaa’i (615), Abu Dawood (437) and Ibn Maajah (698) from Abu Qataadah who said: They mentioned to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that they fell asleep and missed the prayer. He said: “There is no negligence when one is sleeping, rather there is negligence when one is awake. If any one of you forgets to pray, or sleeps and misses a prayer, then let him pray when he remembers.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. The hadeeth also appears in al-Saheehayn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said, explaining the view of the majority: If water is available but the effort to acquire it and use it means that the time will end, it is not permissible for him to do tayammum, whether he is at home or travelling, according to the majority of scholars including al-Shaafa’i, Abu Thawr, Ibn al-Mundhir, and as-haab al-ra’i. It was narrated from al-Awzaa’i and al-Thawri that he may do tayammum. That was narrated from them by al-Waleed ibn Muslim. End quote from al-Mughni (1/166).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person wakes up at the end of the time for prayer and he is junub and is afraid that if he does ghusl the time for the prayer will end, he should do ghusl and pray, even if the time does end. The same applies to one who forgets it. End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: with regard to heating water, if a person has been lazy and got up late from sleeping in the desert, and he is afraid that the time will end –what should he do, should he heat the water or do tayammum?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He has to heat the water even if he is afraid that the time will end, because if the sleeper wakes up late, the time for prayer in his case is when he wakes up from sleep, and not from when the time for that prayer started, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it.” So the time for it begins when he remembers it, for one who forgot it, and when he wakes up, for one who slept. So we say: if you got up about five minutes or ten minutes before sunrise, and if you do tayammum you will manage to pray in time but if you do ghusl the time will end, we say that you should do ghusl even if the time will end, because the time for prayer in your case starts when you wake up, not from when the dawn breaks, because you are excused.
