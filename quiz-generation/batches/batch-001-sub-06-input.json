      "title": "Ruling on racing homing pigeons for prizes or otherwise",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on racing homing pigeons, noting that they give the winnes certificates and cups only, and do not give him money?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Racing pigeons, if it is done without prizes, is disliked, and if it leads to looking into houses and private areas, then it is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (4940), Ibn Majah (3764) and Ahmad (8543) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man chasing a pigeon and he said: “A devil chasing a she-devil.” Classed as sound by al-Albani and the commentators on <em>al-Musnad</em>.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>`Awn al-Ma`bud</em> (13/194): He only called him a devil because he was drifting away from the truth, and because he was distracted by something that did not concern him. And he called the pigeon a she-devil because it made him heedless of remembering Allah. End quote.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Keeping pigeons for their chicks and eggs, or as pets, or to carry messages, is permissible and is not disliked.</p>\n<p>As for playing with them by making them fly and race, it was said that it is not disliked, but the correct view is that it is disliked, and the person’s testimony is not to be rejected for his merely doing that. But if, in addition to that, he gambles [by betting on the outcome of the race] and the like, then his testimony is to be rejected.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Rawdat at-Talibin</em>, 11/226.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;The authorities should prevent those who play with pigeons above people’s heads, because that leads to them looking out over them and seeing into the private areas of their houses (‘awrah).</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud narrated in his <em>Sunan</em> from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (sa), that he saw a man chasing a pigeon and he said: “A devil chasing a she-devil.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim an-Nakha`i said: Whoever plays with flying pigeons will not die until he tastes the pain of poverty.</p>\n<p>Al-Hasan said: I was present when `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) was delivering a khutbah in which he ordered that pigeons be slaughtered and dogs be killed. It was mentioned by al-Bukhari.</p>\n<p>Khalid al-Hadhdha’ narrated that one of the Tabi`in said: The people of Pharaoh used to play with pigeons, and Shurayh did not accept the testimony of one who owned a bathhouse or pigeons.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Mubarak narrated from Sufyan: We heard playing with pigeons is one of the actions of the people of Lut.</p>\n<p>Al-Bayhaqi narrated that Usamah ibn Zayd said: I was present when `Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) instructed that flying pigeons be slaughtered, but those whose were clipped were to be left alone.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>at-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah</em>, p. 240.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to race pigeons for prizes, whether the prize is money, a cup or anything else, and whether the prize is provided by the competitors themselves or by another party, because this is not one of the races or competitions for which Islam allows awarding prizes.</p>\n<p>It was narrated by Abu Dawud (2574), At-Tirmidhi (1700; he classed it as sound) and Ibn Majah (2878) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “There should be no prizes for contests except in archery, horse races or camel races.”</p>\n<p>Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Abu Dawud, and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>As-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Khattabi said: That is, it is not permissible to accept money as a prize for contests except in these two cases, namely camel racing and horse racing. We may add to that similar contests, such as contests in using tools of war, because awarding prizes for that is encouraging jihad and motivating people to participate in it.\" (<em>Hashiyat As-Sindi ‘Ala Sunan Ibn Majah</em>, 2/206)&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>See also the answers to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147826\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">147826</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud",
      "question": "<p>What is the detailed explanation for moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud, and is there a hadeeth about that?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>May Allah reward you with good and benefit the ummah by your knowledge.</div>\n<p> </p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is Sunnah to point with the forefinger and move it during the Tashahhud, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (18890) and al-Nasaa’i from Waa’il ibn Hajar who said: I said, I will watch how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prays. So I watched him and he stood up and said “Allahu akbar,” and raised his hands until they were level with his ears, then he placed his right hand over his left and left wrist and left forearm. Then when he wanted to bow he raised his hands likewise. He put his hands on his knees, then when he raised his head he raised his hands likewise. Then he prostrated and put his hands level with his ears, then he sat resting on his left foot and placed his left hand on his thigh and left knee, and he put the elbow of his right hand on his right thigh. Then he made a circle with two of his fingers, then he raised his finger and I saw him moving it and making du’aa’ with it.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (580) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: When he – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – sat during the prayer, he would place his right hand on his right thigh and clench all his fingers, and point with the finger that is next to the thumb, and he would place his left hand on his left thigh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat during the prayer, he would put his hands on his thighs and raise the finger of his right hand that is next to the thumb, and make du’aa’ with it, and his left hand would be resting on his left thigh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nasaa’i (1273) narrated that Sa’d said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by me whilst I was making du’aa’ with my fingers and he said, “One, one,” and pointed with his index finger. Meaning: point with one finger, namely the index finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad (5964) narrated that Naafi’ said: When ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar sat during the prayer, he would put his hands on his thighs and point with his finger whilst looking at it. Then he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “It is harder on the Shaytaan than iron,” meaning the index finger. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 159.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth indicate two things:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – That one should point with the finger throughout the entire Tashahhud</p>\n<p>2 – That one should move it when making du’aa’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) explained the phrases narrated for the du’aa’ in the Tashahhud. He said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every time you make du’aa’ then move your finger towards upwards towards the One upon Whom you are calling, so we say:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu (Peace be upon you O Prophet) – you should point your finger whilst reciting this because the salaam is a kind of du’aa’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-salaamu ‘alayna (peace be upon us) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allahumma baarik ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A’oodhu Billaaih min ‘adhaabi Jahannam (I seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wa min ‘adhaab il-qabr (and from the torment of the grave) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wa min fitnat il-mahyaa wa’l-mamaat (and from the trials of life and death) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wa min fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal (and from the trial of the Dajjaal) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every time you make du’aa’ point upwards towards the One upon Whom you are calling. This is closer to the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End of quotation from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/202&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I heard this on a video; how sound is it? “No one asks Allah for some worldly matter but he will get an equal amount of worries and stress.”</p>\n",

He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the next day and said: O Messenger of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the third day and said: O Prophet of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter, for if you are pardoned and granted wellbeing in this world and the Hereafter, you will have succeeded.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3846 and others; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that it was said to him: Your brothers have come to you from Basra – and at that time he was in Az-Zawiyah – so that you may pray to Allah for them. He said: May Allah forgive us, have mercy on us, and give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good, and protect us from the Fire. They asked him to say more, so he said something similar, then he said: If you are granted this, then you have been granted all that is good in this world and the hereafter. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in&nbsp;Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 633; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>On the contrary, this Hadith definitively indicates that it is prescribed to offer supplication asking Allah for worldly matters.</p>\n<p>`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her the following supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka min Al-khayri kullihi, `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam. Wa a`udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi, `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam. Allahumma inni as’aluka min khayri ma sa’alaka `abduka wa nabiyyuka, wa a`udhu bika min sharri ma `adha bihi `abduka wa nabiyyuka. Allahumma inni as’aluka Al-jannata wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw `amal, wa a`udhu bika min An-nari wa ma qarraba ilayha min qawlin aw `amal, wa as’aluka an taj`al kulla qada’in qadaytahu li khayran&nbsp;(O Allah, I ask You for all that is good, now and in the future, what I know of it and what I do not know. And I seek refuge with You from all evil, now and in the future, what I know and what I do not know.&nbsp; O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge. O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed. And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good).”</p>\n<p>Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came in one day and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was there, and there was no one except me, my mother, and Umm Haram, my maternal aunt. He came into our house and said to us: Shall I not lead you in prayer? And that was not at the time for any of the [five daily] prayers. A man who was present [when this Hadith was narrated] said: Where did he make Anas stand? He said: He made him stand on his right, then he led us in prayer, then he offered supplication for us – the members of the household – asking for everything good in this world and the hereafter. My mother said: O Messenger of Allah, your little servant [meaning Anas]; pray to Allah for him. So he prayed for everything good for me, and at the end of his supplication he said: O Allah, grant him much wealth and many children, and bless him. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in&nbsp;Al-Adab Al-Mufrad,&nbsp;88; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_is_blameworthy_in_seeking_worldly_matters\"><strong>What is blameworthy in seeking worldly matters?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>What is blameworthy in that regard is two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first thing is when this world is all that a person cares about and strives for, as stated above, and he has no interest in the hereafter and does not strive for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is when his supplication – which is one of the best ways of drawing close to Allah, and is an act of worship and one of the greatest means of attaining what one seeks – is all for worldly matters.</p>\n<p>Ubayy ibn Ka`b (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give glad tidings to this Ummah of prominence, victory and prevalence, so whoever among them does a deed pertaining to the hereafter <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/228454\" target=\"_blank\">for worldly gain</a> , he will have no share in the hereafter.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 21223 and others; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him. Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will settle his affairs for him and make him feel content with his lot, and his provision and worldly gains will undoubtedly come to him.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 4105; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Hence one of the supplications of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asking Allah that this world should not be his main concern and goal.</p>\n<p>Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rarely got up to leave a gathering before offering this supplication for his companions: “O Allah, grant us a share of fear of You that will prevent us from disobeying You, and a share of obedience and righteous deeds that will enable us to reach Your Paradise, and a share of certain faith that will enable us to bear the calamities of this world. Grant us the benefit of our hearing, sight and good health throughout our lives, and let us enjoy them until the last moment of our lives. Enable us to settle the scores with those who have wronged us, and grant us victory over those who oppose us. Do not let calamity befall us in our faith, do not let this world be our main concern or make it all that we know, and do not send against us those who will not show mercy to us.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3502; classed as sound by Al-Albani)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second blameworthy thing is when a person is seized by love of this world to the extent that he does not care whether he seeks worldly gain through permissible means or prohibited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril inspired to me that no soul will die until it has completed its allotted timespan and received its provision in full. So be moderate in seeking provision, and no one of you should let thinking that provision is slow in coming prompt him to seek it by sinful means, for what is with Allah cannot be attained except through obedience to Him” (Narrated by Abu Nu`aym in&nbsp;Al-Hilyah, 10/26 and others; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Based on these two points, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/4448\" target=\"_blank\">being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter</a> , and seeking worldly gain by whatever means are available, not caring whether they are forbidden or prohibited – this is how we should understand the warning against striving for worldly matters or praying for worldly matters.</p>\n<p>Abu Mu`awiyah Al-Aswad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The one for whom this world is his main concern will suffer lengthy worry and distress in the hereafter.”</p>\n<p>Maslamah ibn `Abd Al-Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Those who will feel the least distress in the hereafter are those who have the least worries and stress in this world.”</p>\n<p>Both reports were narrated by Ibn Abu Ad-Dunya in&nbsp;Dhamm Ad-Dunya&nbsp;(283, 284).</p>\n<p>In conclusion,&nbsp; the wording mentioned in the question was not soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there is no sound report from him to suggest that it is not allowed to offer supplication for what is good in this world, so it is not correct to say that praying for what is good in this world will bring worries and stress.</p>\n<p>Rather what has been narrated is a warning against being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter, or seeking worldly gains in ways that are not permissible.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

It is recommended for the Muslim to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7865\" target=\"_blank\">fast six days of Shawwal</a> , and in this there is great virtue and an immense reward.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Virtues_of_fasting_6_days_of_Shawwal\">Virtues of fasting 6 days of Shawwal</span></h3>\n<p>Whoever fasts these six days will have recorded for him a reward as if he had fasted a whole year, as was reported in a sahih hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan and follows it with <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7860\" target=\"_blank\">six days of Shawwal</a> , it will be as if he fasted for a lifetime.” (Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai and Ibn Majah).</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this when he said: “Whoever fasts for six days after (‘Eid) al-Fitr has completed the year: (whoever does a good deed (hasanah) will have ten hasanah like it).” According to another report: “Allah has made for each hasanah ten like it, so a month is like fasting ten months, and fasting six days completes the year.” (al-Nasai and Ibn Majah. See also Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 1/421)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah with the wording: “Fasting for the month of Ramadan brings the reward of ten like it, and fasting for six days brings the reward of two months, and that is the fasting of the whole year.”</p>\n<p>The Hanbali and Shafi'i fuqaha explained that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7858\" target=\"_blank\">fasting six days of Shawwal</a> after fasting Ramadan makes it as if one has fasted for an entire year of obligatory fasts, because the multiplication of the reward applies even to nafl fasts, because each hasanah brings the reward of ten like it.</p>\n<p>Another of the important benefits of fasting six days of Shawwal is that it makes up for any shortfall in a person's obligatory Ramadan fasts, because no one is free of shortcomings or sins that have a negative effect on his fasting.</p>\n<p>On the Day of Resurrection, some of his nafl deeds will be taken to make up the shortcomings in his obligatory deeds, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first thing for which people will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be their salah (prayer). Our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, will say to His angels – although He knows best – ‘Look at the salah of My slave, whether it is complete or incomplete.’ If it is perfect, it will be recorded as perfect, and if something is lacking, He will say, ‘Look and see whether My slave did any voluntary (nafl) prayers.’ If he did some voluntary prayers, [Allah] will say, Complete the obligatory actions of My slave from his voluntary actions.’ Then all his actions will be dealt with in a similar manner.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for a person who has bought a car or a house to offer a sacrifice in gratitude to Allah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The blessings that Allah bestows upon people are many, and His bounty and generosity towards them are vast. A blessing can only be responded to by giving thanks and appreciating it. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has enjoined giving thanks to Him, for He is Appreciative and loves those who give thanks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah has provided for you. And be grateful for the Graces of Allah, if it is He Whom you worship”&nbsp;[al-Nahl 16:144]</p>\n<p>“seek your provision from Allah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back”&nbsp;[al-‘Ankaboot 29:17]</p>\n<p>Part of being grateful to Allah is seeking to draw closer to Him by means of different kinds of acts of worship and to endear oneself to Him by means of good deeds such as prayer, zakaah, fasting and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another part of being grateful to Allah is giving thanks to Him by means of sacrifice rituals, which means offering a sacrifice for the sake of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the verse “Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only)” [al-Kawthar 108:2]:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant is that prayer and sacrifice are the best of the things by means of which one may draw closer to Allah, and the usage of the word fa (translated here as “therefore”) points to the reason, i.e., doing that – prayer and sacrifice – in gratitude for that which Allah has given him of al-Kawthar (a river in Paradise) and much goodness. So he should give thanks to the One Who has blessed him and worship Him, and the two greatest types of worship are these two acts of worship; indeed, prayer is the ultimate act of worship. It is as if He is saying to him: We have given you al-Kawthar and a great deal of goodness, and We have blessed you with that because you have been doing these two acts of worship in gratitude for Our blessing to you; these are the reasons why We have bestowed these blessings upon you, so do these two things for Us, for prayer and sacrifice are surrounded by blessings that come before them and after them. The best financial act of worship is sacrifice and the best physical act of worship is prayer, and the benefits that a slave of Allah may gain from prayer cannot be compared to any other type of worship, as is&nbsp; known by those whose hearts are alive and those of high aspirations. Adding to it the benefits of offering sacrifice, which is a sign of devotion to Allah and thinking positively of Him, and having strong&nbsp; certainty and faith about that which is in the hand of Allah is something wonderful, if that is accompanied by faith and sincerity. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) obeyed the command of his Lord and prayed and sacrificed a great deal to Him; he even sacrificed sixty-three camels with his own hand during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and he used to offer sacrifices on the Eids and at other times. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ al-Fatawa 916/532).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If Allah bestows a great blessing upon a person – and all His blessing are great – then it is mustahabb for him to give thanks to Allah for it by showing kindness to people, so he should offer a sacrifice and make food and invite his brothers and friends, and give charity to those who are in need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (26/180-181):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is mustahabb to give thanks anew when new blessings come, by speaking words of praise. Gratitude for that may also be expressed by doing acts of worship, which includes offering a sacrifice or inviting people to a meal. The fuqaha’ have mentioned the kinds of meals that may be offered when blessing are renewed, such as the wakeerah which is made for a new home, or naqee’ah which is made on the return of an absent loved one, and hidhaaq which is done when a child completes a reading of the Qur’aan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The view of the Hanbalis, the more correct view among the Shaafa’is, is that these meals are mustahabb.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said: These invitations – other than the wedding feast (waleemah) and ‘aqeeqah – are something good, but they are like invitations that are given for no reason; if the person who does them intends thereby to give thanks to Allah for His blessing and to feed his brothers and offer food, then he will have the reward for that in sha Allah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If one of my children does well in school, is it permissible for me to offer a sacrifice to celebrate his success, and to give thanks to Allah?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with making food (waleemah) if the children or one of them succeeds, and inviting one’s loved ones and his child’s friends, to celebrate Allah’s blessing and to encourage the child. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 161, question no. 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is essential to beware of some beliefs which many people hold, and say that in order to protect the new house or car it is essential to offer a sacrifice and sprinkle it with the blood of the slaughtered animal, or that evil spirits will not keep away from you unless you do that, otherwise the blessing will soon dissipate.&nbsp; hese are jaahili beliefs which do not come from someone who believes in Allah as his Lord Who possesses all powers to bring benefit or cause harm, in Whose hand is the creation and the commandment, and knows that it is not permissible to do acts of worship unless they are done for the sake of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about the belief held by many people, that offering a sacrifice on the threshold of the new house before entering it is one of the most important means of warding off the evil eye, and making the house blessed, and avoiding calamities and undesirable events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this custom – i.e., offering a sacrifice on the threshold of the new house – is done in order to placate the jinn and ward off calamities and undesirable events, then it is a haraam custom, and is in fact shirk. This is what seems to be the case with offering the sacrifice before entering the house, and doing it on the threshold in particular.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the intention is to honour one's new neighbours and get to know them, and to give thanks to Allah for the blessing of a new home, and to honour one's relatives and friends on this occasion, and to show them the house, then this is good and the one who does it is to be praised for his action. But that is only usually done after the people have moved into the house, and not before, and the animal or animals should not be slaughtered on the threshold of the house or in the entryway to the house.

      "question": "<p>I am a twenty-seven-year-old woman. I am completely bald on my head as a result of sickness, may Allah grant us and you wellbeing. This causes me a great deal of embarrassment when I have to meet people, and in front of my colleagues at work. That has had a great impact on my psychology. It was suggested to me that I could replace my hair with a wig that is attached to the head and remains there, and can be taken off the head once a month. Is it permissible for me to wear this type of wig, and to do ghusl and wudu and pray whilst wearing it? This is the most appropriate for me, as the nature of my work and my life requires me to be with people all the time, and I find it very difficult and embarrassing to conceal this defect. Please advise me urgently, as  I am in a great deal of emotional distress.</p>\n",

I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) forbid things such as this, and he said: “The Children of Israel were doomed when their women adopted such things.”</p>\n<p>Many of the scholars regarded wearing a wig as coming under the same heading as adding hair extensions, and Allah has cursed the woman who adds hair extensions and the woman who asks to have them added, as al-Bukhari (59937) and Muslim (2122) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed the one who adds hair extensions and the one who has them added, and the one who does tattoos and the one who has them done.” (See <i>Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah, </i>5/191)</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that there is a concession allowing a woman to wear a wig if all of her hair has fallen out.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who took medicine which led to the hair on her head, or most of it, falling out, and she does not want to use a wig because she thinks it is haram. He replied:</p>\n<p>“With regard to using a wig in a case such as the one you described, where her hair has fallen out in such a way that there is no hope that it will grow back, we say: in a case such as this, there is nothing wrong with wearing a wig, because in fact it is not for the purpose of enhancing beautification; rather it is in order to remove a defect. Based on that, it does not come under the heading of adding hair extensions, for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) cursed the one who does that, as he cursed the woman who adds hair extensions and the woman who asks for them to be added. The one who adds hair extensions is the one who attaches something to her hair. But in fact, this woman does not come under the heading of hair extensions, because she does not want to enhance her beauty herself or add to her natural hair that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, created; rather she wants to remove a defect that has occurred, and there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of removing a defect and not under the heading of enhancing beautification. There is a difference between the two matters.” (From the <a href=\"https://binbaz.org.sa/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaykh’s website</a>)</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If someone were to say: What do you say about a bald woman who has no hair on her head – is it permissible for her to wear a wig to cover the defect, not for the purpose of enhancing beautification or making the hair longer?</p>\n<p>The answer – and Allah knows best – is that it is permissible, but there is the story of the woman and her daughter who caught the measles and her hair became thin. She asked the Prophet whether she could add hair extensions and he did not allow her to do that.</p>\n<p>The response to that is: what appears to be the case is that the hair was not lost completely, hence she asked to be allowed to add hair extensions, and asking to add hair extensions indicates that&nbsp; some of the hair was still present, and if some of the hair is present, then adding to it is done for the purpose of enhancing beautification. But if there is no hair, then it is a defect – what I mean is that her head looks like her cheek, with no hair on it at all. And this is something that happens. Do not think that this is a hypothetical matter, for it is not a hypothetical; rather it is real. In that case it seems to me that there is nothing wrong with this, because the purpose is different from the purpose of adding hair extensions, which are not allowed, or it was narrated that the doer is cursed, and that is what is referred to in the hadith.” (Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari,<i> </i>7/599, 600)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ruling_on_hair_implants_for_one_whose_hair_has_fallen_out\">Ruling on hair implants for one whose hair has fallen out</span></h3>\n<p>It is permissible for the one whose hair has fallen out to seek a remedy, even by having a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/113548\" target=\"_blank\">hair transplant</a> , and this does not come under the heading of changing the creation of Allah; rather it is a treatment to restore what Allah, may He be exalted, had created.</p>\n<p>It says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation that was held during its eighteenth session in Malaysia 24-29 Jumada al-Akhirah 1428 AH/9-14 July 2007 CE, regarding cosmetic procedures and what is permissible thereof:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Correcting acquired defects that result from burns, accidents, disease and so on, such as skin transplants and patching, reshaping of the breast completely in the event that it has been entirely removed, or partially reshaping it if its size is too large or too small, such as if it may lead to health problems, and hair transplants in the event of hair loss, especially in women.”</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_should_one_who_wears_a_wig_do_wudu_and_ghusl\">How should one who wears a wig do wudu and ghusl?</span></h3>\n<p>If you wear a wig, you may wipe over it when <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/141074\" target=\"_blank\">doing wudu</a> , because the concession allowing wiping over it is based on making things easier, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stuck his hair together in a process called talbeed when doing Hajj, and wiped over it, meaning that he put something like glue over it, to hold the hair together and not let dust get into it.</p>\n<p>However it must be taken off when doing ghusl, because it is obligatory to make the water reach all of the skin.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_women_appear_in_front_of_men_wearing_the_wignbsp\">Can women appear in front of men wearing the wig?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>It is not permissible to appear in front of men wearing the wig, because it is a kind of adornment that must be covered, in addition to what it may involve of attracting men’s attention.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to grant you healing and well-being.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I like to fast in the winter because the days are short. Of course I hope for the reward of Allah, but I also hope to lose a little weight. Is it permissible for me to combine two intentions? Another question also occurred to me: many people – including myself – are afraid of sin and of committing haraam actions for fear of what people will say, or for fear of scandal or shame, or loss of dignity and self-pride. Will that be good for a person in the hereafter?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with combining the intention of seeking reward for fasting and the intention of losing weight, although it is preferable for a person to intend his fasting for the purpose of attaining reward only. Losing weight will inevitably happen when one fasts, whether one intends that or not.</p>\n<p>As-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ashbaah wa’n-Nazaa’ir (pp. 21-22):</p>\n<p>Combined intentions (and motives) are of many types. Firstly, a person may have, alongside the intention of worship, a motive that is not worship but will not invalidate it. One example of that is if a person intends to do wudoo’ or ghusl, and also to cool himself. There are some views which suggest that it is not valid because of that combined intention, but the more correct view is that it is valid, because cooling oneself is something that will inevitably happen, regardless of whether or not that was part of the motive for doing wudoo’ or ghusl. So he did not plan to have a combined intention, and he did not intend to undermine his sincerity; rather his intention was to do an act of worship in a manner or at a time that is prescribed, because one of its inevitable outcomes is cooling oneself. The same applies if a person has the intention to fast, and also has another motive, namely the desire to avoid certain foods for reasons of health. But there is still some difference of opinion concerning that.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112075&nbsp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">112075&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>With regard to giving up sin for fear of what people will say, or because the individual has no motive to commit that sin, or he refrains from it because of shyness before people, this has been discussed previously in detail, in the answer to question number <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/180814\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">180814</a>&nbsp; qv.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Either one of these reasons is sufficient to     waive their guardianship of you with regard to your marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, you     can get married without their consent.
