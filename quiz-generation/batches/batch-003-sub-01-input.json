      "title": "Selling goods when they are still on the ship or plane; who is liable for them if they are damaged or destroyed?",
      "question": "<p>Someone bought a shipload of rice, and before the cargo reached him and was received, he sold it to someone else. Then soon after that the ship sank. Is the transaction valid, and who is liable for the loss of the cargo? What about goods that are brought in from abroad, whether by plane or by ship – once the goods are no longer in the possession of the seller, after shipping, and there is documentation of the transaction between the two parties: isn’t that regarded as receipt of the goods? Or is it stipulated that goods should be received and taken away by the purchaser? Who is liable for the goods if they are damaged or destroyed in this case? What about selling goods that are already on board ships at sea, where they are at risk of accidents and destruction?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The sale transaction transfers ownership of the goods from the seller to the purchaser, but they remain the liability of the seller until the purchaser receives and takes possession of them.</p>\n<p>When the purchaser himself, or his agent, receives the goods and takes possession of them, and removes them from the seller’s warehouses, it becomes permissible for him to sell them, even if they are still on board a ship or plane, because by receiving them and moving them, they become his liability. For that reason, it becomes permissible for him to sell them and make a profit on them, whereas it is not permissible for him to do that before they become his liability, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on an item for which you are not liable, and he (blessings and some of Allah be upon him) said: “Profit is connected to liability.”</p>\n<p>So if the agreement is that the seller’s responsibility ends as soon as the goods are delivered to the shipping company that the purchaser chooses, or that the seller recommends, then as soon as the goods leave the seller’s warehouse and are transported to the shipping company, whether they are being shipped by sea or by air, and the documents proving the sale are handed over, this is regarded as being like receipt of goods and more.</p>\n<p>Thus the goods become the liability of the purchaser, so if they are lost or damaged at sea or in the air, the purchaser is liable, because he took possession of them and moved them to the port, either by himself or through his agent.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Selling goods when they are on the ship or plane is a valid transaction, by means of which ownership is transferred.</p>\n<p>So if the merchant sells his goods when they are still on the ship, before they reach him, and they had become his liability, as noted above in the previous paragraph, then the transaction is valid. The new purchaser has the option of cancelling the deal if any defect becomes apparent or if the goods differ from the description given in the contract.</p>\n<p>If it so happens that the goods are damaged before they are received by the purchaser, the new purchaser is not liable for that, because the goods remain the liability of the seller until the purchaser receives them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Conclusion:</p>\n<p>If the purchaser/importer had received the goods (the rice) himself, and he himself shipped them, or asked his agent to receive the goods from the seller/supplier, even if the agent is the shipping company itself, and the goods are damaged or destroyed before they reach the place where the purchaser wanted them to go, then&nbsp; the purchaser is liable for that, because he received the goods in a real sense and was the one who disposed of them by shipping them himself.</p>\n<p>But if the seller/supplier is the one who shipped the goods himself, or his agent did that, or the transaction was done on board the ship, then the goods were destroyed before they were received by the purchaser, then the seller is liable for them.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is a mursal hadeeth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    A hadeeth is called a “mursal hadeeth” if the one who     narrated it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a     Taabi’i and not a Sahaabi. It is possible to differentiate between a Sahaabi     and a Taabi’i by referring to books of biography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Abu ‘Abd-Allah al-Haakim (may Allah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no difference of opinion among the shaykhs of     hadeeth that the mursal hadeeth is one which the muhaddith narrated with a     complete isnaad back to the Taabi’i, and the Taabi’i says, “The Messenger of     Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.” End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ma’rifah ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth, 67&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This name is given by consensus to the hadeeth of a senior     Taabi’i from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him), such as when ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Adiyy ibn al-Khayyaar, or Abu Umaamah     ibn Sahl ibn Haneef, or ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Aamir ibn Rabee’ah, and the like,     say: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     said…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The same applies to those who are lower in status than these,     such as Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab, Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd     al-Rahmaan, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, and others like them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The same applies to ‘Ilqimah ibn Qays, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda’,     al-Hasan, Ibn Sireen, al-Sha’bi, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, and others like them     among the rest of the Taabi’een who it has been proven met a number of the     Sahaabah and spent time with them. This is what is meant by mursal according     to the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also applies to reports narrated from Taabi’een of lower     status than those mentioned above, such as hadeeth narrated by Ibn Shihaab,     Qataadah, Abu Haazim and Yahya ibn Sa’eed from the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him), which they call mursal, like the mursal reports     of the senior Taabi’een. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is essential to point out that the muhadditheen --     especially the earlier ones among them -- called every report that had an     interruption in its isnaad a mursal report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Mursal refers to a report whose isnaad (chain of     transmission) is interrupted, meaning that among its narrators is one who     did not hear it from the one whose name comes before his. But in most cases,     what is described as mursal is that which was narrated by the Taabi’i from     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).

      "title": "He is\r\n    suffering a relapse after he repented",
      "question": "<p>I was brought up in a good Muslim household<br />\n      in the West. Unfortunately in my teenage years I allowed myself to be led astray by<br />\n      Shaitaan and committed many mortal sins for a number of years, even going out of Islam. I<br />\n      have tried to repent and reform over the last couple of years. I perform all the five<br />\n      pillars, give sadaqa generously, get involved with dawah and try to be helpful to Muslims.<br />\n      I am good to my wife and parents. <br />However my heart is very shaky indeed. Sometimes I am convinced of the<br />\n      truth but usually I am \"sumum bukmun\". I find that my heart is very arrogant,<br />\n      evil and hates the Truth. I have tried hard to repress these negative feelings but cannot<br />\n      fully overcome them. I want to become a Muslim again but am at the point of resigning<br />\n      myself to a life of Taaghoot. I have read countless books and been to many lectures but I<br />\n      have made no progress. I want to succeed in this life and be saved from the Fire. What can<br />\n      I do? Do I need to do the Shahada again? <br /> Please help me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>His Excellence Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the following question:</p>\n<p>I am a young man who has wronged myself by committing many sins. I do    not even pray in the mosque, I have never fasted all of Ramadaan in my life, and I do    other bad things. Often I have promised myself that I will repent, but then I go back to    my bad ways. I make friends with young people in our neighbourhood who are not very good,    and most of my brothers’ friends who come to our house are also not righteous. Allaah    knows that I have wronged myself by committing so many sins and doing bad things, but    every time I resolve to repent, I go back to my old ways again. I hope that you can show    me a way to get closer to my Lord and keep me from doing these bad things.</p>\n<p>He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:</p>\n<p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed    against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of    Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”    [al-Zumar 39:54] </p>\n<p>The scholars agreed that this aayah was revealed concerning those who    repent; whoever repents sincerely from his sins, Allaah will forgive him all his sins, as    this aayah says, and as Allaah says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Turn to Allaah with sincere repentance! It    may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under    which rivers flow (Paradise)” [al-Tahreem 66:8]</p>\n<p>In this aayah, Allaah made the forgiveness of sins and admittance to    Paradise conditional upon sincere repentance, which includes giving up and avoiding sins,    regretting the sins of the past, and sincerely resolving not to go back to them, out of    reverence for Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.</p>\n<p>One of the conditions of sincere repentance is that one should restore    what is rightfully due to people whom you have wronged or asking for their forgiveness if    the sin involved wronging them with regard to blood, wealth or honour. If it is not    possible to ask your brother for forgiveness concerning his honour, then you must pray for    him a lot, and speak of him in the best way you can in the places where you gossiped about    him, for good deeds expiate for bad deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“… And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O    believers, that you may be successful.” [al-Noor 24:31]. In this aayah, Allaah    made the connection between success and tawbah, which indicates that the one who repents    will be successful and blessed. If the one who repents follows his repentance with faith    and righteous deeds, Allaah will wipe out his sayi’aat (evil deeds) and    replace them with hasanaat (good deeds). Allaah says in Soorat al-Furqaan,    after mentioning shirk, killing without just cause and zina (unlawful sexual    intercourse) (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection,    and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good    deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:69-70]</p>\n<p>One of the means of repentance is praying to Allaah for guidance and    strength, asking Him to bless you with repentance. Allaah is the One Who says    (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My    Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your    (invocation)…” [Ghaafir 40:60]</p>\n<p>And He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then    (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of    the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor).”    [al-Baqarah 2:186]</p>\n<p>Another of the means of repentance which will help you adhere to it is    keeping company with good people and following their example of righteous conduct, and    keeping away from bad company. It was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“A man will be on the path of his close friends, so pay attention    to who you make friends with.”</p>\n<p>And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“The likeness of a righteous companion is that of the seller of    musk: either he will give you a gift, or you will buy something from him, or you will    smell a pleasant fragrance from him. And the likeness of an evil companion is that of the    man who works the bellows: either he will burn your garment, or you will smell an    unpleasant odour from him.” </p>\n<p>(Majmoo’ Fataawaa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez    ibn Baaz; Fataawaa al-‘Aqeedah, part 2, p. 640)</p>\n<p>With regard to renewing your Islam: if you have done something that    takes you out of Islam altogether, then you have to pronounce the Shahaadatayn and    re-enter Islam because you had left it. If what you have done is a major sin which does    not, however, take you out of Islam, then it is sufficient for you to repent according to    the conditions referred to above. Do not despair of the Mercy of Allaah; follow the path    of salvation. May Allaah give us and you the strength to do all that is good. May Allaah    bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to bless us and you with sincere repentance and to forgive    us and you. May He show you the way out from your problem and bring us and you together in    Gardens of Delight (Paradise) facing one another on thrones [cf. Al-Hijr 15:47]. Ameen.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is the concept of the Christian Trinity that the Quran declares to be false?",
      "question": "<p>In various places in the quran the christians are condemned for saying that Allah is the third of three (surat an nisa 4:171 and surat al Maida 5:73 for example ). When I read the verses I assumed that they referred to the christian trinity (father, son, holy spirit), but the tafsir of ibn kathir states that what is meant here is that christians claimed that Allah was a third with Isa (alleihi salaam) and Maryam. Is this correct? If so, is this referrring to a specific group/sect? (as is the case with the jews claiming Uzair is the son of Allah) Is the trinity of mainstream christianity dealt with directly in the quran and the sunnah, or is no mention of it made? I know the divinity of Isa ( alleihi salaam) is dealt with, but is there anything concerning the supposed holy spirit?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’ But there is no llaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God -Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:73].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The correct view is that this was revealed concerning the Christians in particular, as was stated by Mujaahid and others.</p>\n<p>Then the scholars differed concerning that. It was said that what is meant by that is their disbelief (kufr) because they say that there are three hypostases (“persons” of the trinity), namely the hypostasis of the Father, the hypostasis of the Son and the hypostasis of the Word that was transmitted from the Father to the Son – exalted be Allah far above what they say.</p>\n<p>As-Suddi and others said: This was revealed concerning their making the Messiah and his mother into two gods with Allah, thus making Allah the third of three, according to this concept. As-Suddi said: This is like what Allah, may He be exalted, says at the end of the soorah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): \"O 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?'\" He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:116].</p>\n<p>This view is the one that is more likely to be correct. And Allah knows best.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer&nbsp; 3/158).</p>\n<p>This interpretation which was favoured by Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) is the one that is more likely to be correct, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>-1-&nbsp;Ibn Katheer quoted, as further evidence, some reports from the righteous early generations, in which they follow the methodology of interpreting some parts of the Quran by means of other parts, which is one of the best and most appropriate ways of interpreting the Holy Quran.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If someone were to ask: What are the best ways of interpreting the Quran? The answer is: The soundest way is to interpret the Quran by means of the Quran, because what is discussed in general terms in one place is explained elsewhere, and what is mentioned in brief in one place is mentioned in more detail elsewhere.\"(Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (13/363).</p>\n<p>The early generations thought that the words “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)” are explained by the words of Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?”’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours, truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).</p>\n<p>‘Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things’”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:116-117].</p>\n<p>-2-&nbsp;This interpretation is supported by what follows the verse, confirming that Maryam (Mary – peace be upon her) is not divine, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: \"Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).\" But there is no llaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God -Allah)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:73].</p>\n<p>Then after that come the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The Messiah ['Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the words of Allah and His Books]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allah does not eat). Look how We make the Ayât (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them, yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:75].</p>\n<p>This verse confirms that Maryam (Mary – peace be upon her) is not divine, on two counts:</p>\n<p>(i) Her status is that of siddeeqiyyah (being strong and true in faith), which is a status of servitude to Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>(ii) She used to eat food, which is the description of a created being who has needs; it is not the description of God Who is independent of means and has no need of His creation.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to what the Quran says about what the Christians said, “Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)”, the commentators said that it refers to Allah, the Messiah and his mother, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that He will say (interpretation of the meaning): “‘O 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?”’” [al-Maa’idah 5:116]. Hence in the context of this passage He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The Messiah ['Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the words of Allah and His Books]”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:75].</p>\n<p>The most that the Messiah can be is a Messenger, and the most that his mother can be is a siddeeqah; they could never reach the level of divinity. The one proves the other (that is, the fact that they are no more than that is proof that the Messiah is not God), and this is quite clear.\"(Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa&nbsp; 2/444).</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words “They both used to eat food” mean: they both needed to be nourished by food, and to expel the resulting waste products. So they were two slaves of Allah, like all other people, and they were not gods as the ignorant Christians claim.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer&nbsp; 3/159).</p>\n<p>-3-&nbsp;The revelation came to expose misguidance and disbelief, and to explain the way of guidance. It did not come to rectify the terminology used by the disbelievers. The concept of Trinity in which the Christians believe, regardless of their various interpretations thereof, in reality boils down to exaggeration about ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and his mother. Therefore the Quran dealt with and refuted this basic concept, and struck at the roots of the idea of Trinity, refuting the blasphemous idea that is common to all of their groups. Therefore we may say that the view that this verse was revealed to criticise their taking the Messiah and his mother as two gods besides Allah, may He be exalted, is not contrary to the reality of the Christians; rather it is highlighting the true essence of their blasphemy, that is common to all of their groups.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the context of discussing the verses that refute the blasphemy of the Christians:</p>\n<p>The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “The Messiah ['Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him” [al-Maa’idah 5:75] come after the words “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)’” [al-Maa’idah 5:73], which indicates that the trinity that Allah says they believe in involves regarding the Messiah son of Maryam and his mother as two gods.</p>\n<p>This is clear, on the basis that what is narrated from the Christians is that they believe that the divine descended upon Mary and was incarnated in the Messiah. This is in accordance with their beliefs.</p>\n<p>Based on that, every verse in which Allah mentions their views refers to all of their groups and refers to their belief in the Trinity and the notions of the divine descending upon Mary and being incarnated in the Messiah. Thus it includes all types of Christians and all types of their blasphemy. It is not the case that every verse that speaks of them is speaking of one type, as some have suggested, and there is not one verse that speaks about the Trinity and another that speaks about the descent of the divine and incarnation. Rather Allah, may He be glorified, mentions, in every single verse referred to, the blasphemy this is common to all of them, but He describes their blasphemy is being threefold, each aspect of which implies the other two: they say that the Messiah is God, and they say that he is the son of God, and they say that God is the third of three, as they took their Messiah and his mother as gods besides the true God, one on the basis of the divine descending upon her and the other on the basis of the divine being incarnated in him. Thus it becomes clear that they believe in three gods in one. This covers all the blasphemous concepts of the Christians.\"(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra&nbsp; 6/589-590).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, (\"Be!\" - and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh)[] created by Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allah is (the only) One Ilaah (God), glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs”[an-Nisa’ 4:171].</p>\n<p>With regard to the words “Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’”, the word translated here as three is the subject of a hidden predicate, and any word may be assumed to be the predicate that refers to the Trinity of the Christians. Hence the scholarly views vary in trying to determine what the omitted predicate could be.</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is “Say not” that our gods are three. This was narrated from az-Zajjaaj.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas said: This refers to the Trinity: Allah, may He be exalted, and His wife and His son.</p>\n<p>Al-Farraa’ and Abu ‘Ubayd said: This means: do not say they are three…</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Ali said: The meaning implies: Do not say that He is the third of three… The Christians of all sects are unanimously agreed on the Trinity.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi&nbsp; 7/233).</p>\n<p>Therefore this verse refers to all types of Christian belief in the Trinity.</p>\n<p>At-Taahir Ibn ‘Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The audience addressed by the words “Say not” is the Christians in particular.</p>\n<p>The word “three” is the subject of a hidden predicate. The reason why it was omitted is so that the phrase will be fit to refer to all the ideas that they have of the Trinity, for the Christians varied with regard to the concept of the divine trinity, as we shall see below. Therefore we could figure out what the hidden predicate is, according to their various views regarding the nature of the Trinity, which could be described by the number three.</p>\n<p>The Trinity is fundamental to the belief of all Christians, but they differ concerning its precise nature.\"(At-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer&nbsp; 6/54)</p>\n<p>If you interpret it on the basis of the report that al-Qurtubi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), that what is meant by the Trinity is Allah, may He be exalted, and His wife and His son, then this interpretation is supported by the verses mentioned above in the first point.</p>\n<p>According to this view, this verse forbids the Christians to exaggerate about ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and his mother, which is the basis of the belief in Trinity that is common among them. Declaring their exaggeration to be false is declaring their belief in the Trinity to be false too.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Although what is well-known about the Christians is that they do not regard Mary (peace be upon her as one of the three hypostases (persons of the trinity) in which they believe, this does not rule out the fact that they regard her as a sort of god (or goddess).</p>\n<p>Taking Mary as a goddess means either clearly stating that she is divine, which was a belief attributed to some ancient Christian groups, or what we see of the Christian practice that is widespread among them of devoting some acts of worship to her, such as praying to her, seeking her help, and prostrating to her image. Whoever worships a thing has taken it as a god, even if he does not clearly state that.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Mary is mentioned alongside the Messiah, because some Christians took her as another god and worshipped her as they worshipped the Messiah. As for those who do not believe in that, they still ask of her what should be asked of God, to the extent that they say to her: Forgive me, have mercy on me, and so on, based on a belief that she will intercede with her son concerning that.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they say: O mother of God, intercede for us with God. And sometimes they ask her for their needs, which should be sought from God, and they do not mention intercession. Others worship her as they worshipped the Messiah.</p>\n<p>Sa‘eed ibn al-Batreeq spoke of them doing this, when he mentioned the Councils of Constantinople and Nicaea. He said:</p>\n<p>They held different views and different beliefs. Some of them said that the Messiah and his mother were two gods besides Allah; they were the Marianists.\"(Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh&nbsp; 4/255-256).</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The phrase “Holy Spirit” (Rooh al-Qudus) appears in the texts of revelation; what it refers to is Jibreel (Gabriel – peace be upon him).</p>\n<p>For example, it is seen in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Qur'an) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the Faith of) those who believe and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to Allah as Muslims)”&nbsp;[an-Nahl 16:102].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Holy Spirit is Jibreel. What is meant is a spirit that is sanctified, i.e., pure and free of anything that is not befitting.</p>\n<p>This meaning is referred to in many verses, such as (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's Permission’” [al-Baqarah 2:97].\"(Adwa’ al-Bayaan&nbsp; 3/442).</p>\n<p>At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Allah called Jibreel a “spirit” and described him as “holy” because Allah gave him a spirit created by Him, without needing a father to father him. Because of that, He called him a spirit and described him as holy. Holy means pure. By the same token, ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary) was called “a spirit created by Allah”, because Allah gave him a spirit created by Him, without needing a father to father him. We have explained previously in this book of ours that what is meant by being holy is being pure, so the one who is holy is pure and free of that.\"(Tafseer at-Tabari&nbsp; 2/224)</p>\n<p>In the books of the Christians, concerning the story of Maryam’s conception of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), it says that it happened by means of the Holy Spirit. This is in accordance with what our religion teaches, that Allah sent an angel to her, namely Jibreel, and he breathed into her and she conceived ‘Eesa (peace be upon him).</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And mention in the Book (the Quran, O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.</p>\n<p>She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Rooh [angel Jibreel (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.</p>\n<p>She said: ‘Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.’</p>\n<p>(The angel) said: ‘I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son’”&nbsp;[Maryam 19:16-19].</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Christians say in their creed (profession of faith) that the Messiah “was incarnate by the Holy Ghost [Spirit] of the Virgin Mary.” This is in accordance with what Allah says, that He sent His spirit, namely Jibreel, who is the Holy Spirit; he breathed into Maryam (Mary), and she conceived the Messiah. So the Messiah was a created, incarnate being created from his mother and from that spirit, and that spirit has nothing to do with the attributes of Allah or His life or anything else. Rather the Holy Spirit is mentioned frequently in the words of the Prophets, and what is meant by these words is either the angel or what Allah creates in the hearts of His Prophets and close friends (awliya’) of guidance, steadfastness and so on.\"(Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh&nbsp; 2/186).</p>\n<p>But in the process of distorting their religion, the Christians thought that they could not prove that ‘Eesa is the son of God, – exalted be He far above that – except by interpreting the Holy Spirit that Allah sent to Maryam as referring to an attribute of God that exists in Him, and is the Giver of life.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>They had a third council, fifty-eight years after the first Council of Nicaea. The emperor’s advisers and courtiers met with him and told him that the people’s beliefs had become corrupted and been influenced by the views of Arius and Macedonius, so he should write to all the bishops and patriarchs, instructing them to convene a meeting and explain the religion of Christianity. So the Emperor wrote to all the regions, and one hundred and fifty bishops gathered in Constantinople, where they examined and discussed the views of Arius, and found that his view stated that the Holy Spirit was a created being, not divine.</p>\n<p>But the Patriarch of Alexandria said: In our view, the Holy Spirit is nothing but the spirit of God, and the spirit of God is nothing but His life. If we say that the Holy Spirit is created, then we are saying that God’s life is created, and if we say that His life is created, then we are implying that He is not alive, and that is blasphemy.</p>\n<p>They all cursed whoever holds such a belief… And they stated that the Holy Spirit is a creator and not created, “very God from very God”, from the same essence as the Father and the Son, one essence and one nature.\"(Hidaayat al-Hayaara&nbsp; p. 410).</p>\n<p>They covered up this distortion and misguidance of theirs by playing with words that are mentioned in their Scriptures as being the words of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him).</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This is how it is according to the People of the Book, that Jesus “was incarnate by the Holy Ghost [Spirit] of the Virgin Mary”, but their misguidance is based on their misunderstanding, when they said that the Holy Spirit was the life of God, and a God that creates, grants provision and is worshipped. But there is nothing in the divinely-revealed Books or in the words of the Prophets to suggest that Allah described an attribute that is part of His Essence as the Holy Spirit, or that He described His word or any of His attributes as a son. This is one of the things that proves that the Christians are misguided and that they distorted the words of the Prophets and interpreted them in a manner different from the meaning intended by the Prophets.</p>\n<p>The origin of their concept of the Trinity is based on what is mentioned in one of the Gospels, that the Messiah (peace be upon him) said to them: “Baptise all people in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.”</p>\n<p>It may be said to them: If the Messiah really said that, there is nothing in the language of the Messiah or the language of any of the Prophets that they described an attribute of Allah that is part of His Essence – neither His word nor His life – as His son or as the Holy Spirit. They did not call His word His son and they did not describe God Himself as a son or Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>As that is the case, then this may explain that what is meant by son is not the eternal Word of Allah, which they say was begotten of God, even if it is eternal, and what is meant by the Holy Spirit is not the life of God. Rather what is meant by the son is the human Messiah and what is meant by the Holy Spirit is what came down to him of revelation and the angel who brought it down. Thus the Messiah would have enjoined them to believe in Allah and His Messenger, and in what He revealed to His Messenger and in the angel who brought it down. This was enjoined upon all the Prophets.\"(Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh&nbsp; 2/152-153].</p>\n<p>From the above it becomes clear that the Christian belief in the third hypostasis (person of the trinity), the Holy Spirit, is not an independent issue; rather it is an issue that is connected to their belief in Jesus being the son of God – exalted be He above that. Therefore proving false the belief that he is the son of God will lead to annulling their belief in the third person of the Trinity.</p>\n<p>Hence the texts of revelation which state that Allah is One and unique, He begets not nor is He begotten, and all the texts which declare false the belief in Trinity and the divinity of Jesus (peace be upon him) – all of these texts are sufficient to refute the belief in the hypostasis of the Holy Spirit as held by the Christians. Perhaps this is the reason why the revelation did not discuss the issue of the Holy Spirit separately.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on doing essential repairs to houses using zakaah money",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to give the zakaah on gold to a poor woman to do some essential repairs to her house?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If someone needs to do some essential repairs to his house, and does not have enough money to do that, it is permissible to give him zakaah funds for this purpose, subject to two conditions:</p>\n<p>1.. That the house actually needs those repairs, such as if there is the fear of a wall collapsing, or water leaking through the roof, and so on, and it is not solely for cosmetic purposes which one can do without.</p>\n<p>2.. That the repairs should be appropriate to the situation of this poor person, without spending extravagantly.</p>\n<p>The guideline in this case is that shelter is a basic need, and leaving the house without doing essential repairs when needed is undermining the basic benefit of the house in a way that may lead to the loss of that benefit altogether. Hence it is permissible to give zakaah to the poor person in order to make sure that this essential need is met properly and maintained.</p>\n<p>Even though we stated that a house should not be built for the poor person with zakaah funds, as noted in the answer to question no. 111884, essential repairs are a different matter, because there is a real need for them, and because it will not consume as much of the zakaah funds as construction of a new house would.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars regard it as permissible to buy or build a house for a poor person with zakaah funds.</p>\n<p>Imam Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that he did not see anything wrong with giving a man some of his zakaah so that he could go for Hajj or ransom himself from slavery.</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Ubayd said: And the minimum price for freeing a slave is more than two hundred dirhams.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas granted a concession stating that the entire amount for freeing one person may be taken from zakaah, even though one of the fuqaha’ did not accept this view, and he did not regard it as makrooh because of the high cost; rather he regarded it as makrooh because after manumitting the slave, the one who does that will have the connection of wala’ [and its advantages] with the former slave. But the views of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are more deserving of being followed.</p>\n<p>All these reports indicate that with regard to the amount of zakaah that is given to those in need, it is not limited to a particular time such that the Muslims cannot give it at any other time, and that it may be given even if the recipient is not in debt. In fact it may be given to someone out of compassion, by way of seeking reward, if that is the motive of the giver, without showing favouritism or being influenced by whims and desires, such as the case of a man who sees a household of righteous Muslims who are poor and needy, and he has a great deal of wealth, and these people have no house to shelter them and meet their needs, so he uses the zakaah of his wealth to buy a house for them to protect them from the cold of winter and the heat of the sun; or they are naked and do not have sufficient clothing, so he buys them clothes sufficient to cover their ‘awrah when praying and to protect them from heat and cold; or he sees a slave who has a bad master who is abusing and mistreating him, so he rescues him from slavery by buying him and then manumitting him; or he meets a wayfarer who is far from home and is cut off, so he gives him a mount so that he can reach his homeland and his family, either hiring it or buying it for him. In these and similar situations, that cannot be addressed except by spending a great deal of money, where the giver does not want to do it as an act of general charity, so he does it using the zakaah on his wealth – if he does that, wouldn’t he have fulfilled his duty and wouldn’t his zakaah be valid?</p>\n<p>Indeed it would, and he is a doer of good.</p>\n<p>I am worried, in the case of scholars who disapprove of the action of such a person because he does not want to give it as something voluntary [rather he wants to give it as zakaah], that this may mean that such scholars are preventing him, by means of such a verdict, from carrying out the obligatory duty of zakaah, and thus the people’s right to zakaah will be neglected and the poor will suffer.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>al-Amwaal</em> (p. 677).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) realized that I felt too shy so he went on his way. Then I came to al-Zubayr and told him that I had met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) carrying the date-stones on my head, and there was a group of his companions with him, and he had made his camel kneel so that I could ride behind him, but I had felt too shy and I remember his (al-Zubayr’s) protective jealousy. He said: “By Allah, for you to have to carry the date-stones is harder for me to bear than your riding with him.” She said: Then later on Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse and it was as if I had been set free from slavery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth of the woman from Ghifaar was narrated by Abu Dawood (313) from that woman of Banu Ghifaar who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) let me ride behind him on the back of his camel-saddle. This was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is not one of the issues on which the scholars are unanimously agreed, rather some of them clearly stated that there was a difference of scholarly opinion on this point. Al-‘Iraaqi said in Tarh al-Tathreeb (5/167), concerning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entering upon Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr: He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon Dubaa’ah to visit her when she was sick or to visit her because she was his relative as stated above. This points to his humility, upholding of kinship ties and concern for his relatives. It is to be interpreted as meaning that he was not alone with a woman in this case, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not sit alone with non-mahram women or shake hands with them. If he did do that then this does not mean that his infallibility was tarnished thereby, but they did not regard that as being one of his unique characteristics, thus he is like others with regard to this issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The author wrote it to give evidence, falsely, that it is Islamically prescribed to celebrate the Prophet’s birthday and to exaggerate about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and to seek his help and ask of him – and other Prophets and righteous people – besides Allah. Hence it is full of falsehoods, fabricated Hadiths and strange stories. If we were to examine it and critique it, it would take a very long time. Almost every single line of it requires some comment and refutation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among these lies and fabrications is what he (falsely) attributes to Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), saying that he used to seek the help of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and ask him besides Allah, saying:</p>\n<p>“O Master of masters, I have come to you, hoping that you will be pleased with me and will offer me your protection.</p>\n<p>By Allah, O Best of creation, I have a heart that is longing for you and does not want anyone but you.</p>\n<p>By your virtue, I am in love with you, and Allah knows how much I love you.</p>\n<p>O you who are the best of the two races (mankind and the jinn), bestow on me your generosity; I am happy if you are pleased with me.</p>\n<p>I am hoping for your generosity, as Abu Hanifah has no one else in this world but you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then he says that Imam Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“The family of the Prophet are my means to reach Him and they would lead me to Him.</p>\n<p>I hope by virtue of them that I will be given my record in my right hand on the Day of Resurrection.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is undoubtedly a lie about these two great imams who affirmed the Oneness of Allah. Otherwise, let him prove that from them with sound chains of narration going back to them, or even a weak chain of narration via which such a report could be transmitted. But they can never do that!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The polytheistic material narrated in this book includes the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It should be noted that seeking help from the beloved ones of Allah, may He be Exalted, such as the Prophets, the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8928\" target=\"_blank\">Awliya’ (close friends of Allah)</a> and the righteous is permissible during their lifetimes and after their deaths…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“… Thus it is known that it is permissible to seek help by saying `O Messenger of Allah, help me’ or `O Ghawth (source of help), O Muhiy Ad-Din `Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jilani and so on.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another example of this polytheistic material that is contained in this book is that which is mentioned by the questioner, “artakabtu Al-khataya, laka ashku ya sidi ya khayr an-nabiyyin (I have committed sins, I complain to you, O my master, O best of the Prophets).”</p>\n<p>This comes under the heading of major polytheism, because repentance from sins can only be to Allah alone, and complaining about the consequences of sins and their impact can only be done to Allah alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no. 179363, we explained that the words (interpretation of the meaning): {If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)…} [An-Nisa’ 4:64] were applicable only during the lifetime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and not after his death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This verse encouraged the Ummah to come to him if they had been unjust to themselves (or wronged themselves) by committing sin or falling into that which was more serious than that, namely Shirk. They were to come to him, repentant and regretting what they had done, so that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could pray for forgiveness for them. What was meant by that coming was coming to him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was still alive. Coming to him after his death for this purpose is not permissible. The evidence for that is the fact that the Companions and those who had deep knowledge of Islam did not do that, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not have the power to do that after he died.” (End quote from <em>Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz</em>, 6/189-190)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_ask_the_Prophet_for_help\">Can you ask the Prophet for help?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111019\" target=\"_blank\">Calling upon the Prophet</a> (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and asking of him besides Allah, and seeking his help, is a major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, so how about seeking the help of anyone other than him?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21524\" target=\"_blank\">Calling upon the Prophet</a> (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking his help after his death to meet one’s needs or relieve one of distress is major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam.” (End quote from <em>Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah</em>, 1/473)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114142\" target=\"_blank\">Calling upon the Prophet</a> (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or any lesser person is Shirk and misguidance, because these people cannot respond. What one must do is repent to Allah from this Shirk and not call upon anyone except Allah. We all know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) himself did not possess any power to bring benefit or cause harm, except by the will of Allah. Allah, may He be Exalted, instructed him to declare that to his Ummah, as Allah said to him (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.} [Al-A`raf 7:188]</p>\n<p>{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration’.} [Al-An`am 6:50]</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11402\" target=\"_blank\">The Messenger himself used to pray to Allah</a> , may He be Glorified, seeking forgiveness and mercy for himself, and for his companions. If he had been able to grant forgiveness to anyone or bestow mercy on him, he would not have needed to pray to Allah, may He be Glorified, for that. But all of creation is in need of Allah, and it is Allah alone Who is Free of all wants and needs, Worthy of all praise, as He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise} [Fatir 35:15]. Were it not for the devils toying with the minds of these people they would realise that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and others do not possess any power to benefit or harm anyone, and they would call upon Allah alone, with no partner or associate: {Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allah?} [An-Naml 27:62]” (End quote from <em>Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin</em>, 21/218-219)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The point is that complaining about one’s situation and one’s sin, admitting it and repenting from it to any human being, or seeking help and aid from him, comes under the heading of Shirk or ascribing partners to Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. Indeed it comes under the heading of pure acts of worship which it is not permissible to devote to any except Allah, may He be Exalted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Sahih Muslim (2577) it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, narrating from his Lord, may He be blessed and Exalted: “ `O My slaves, all of you are astray except those whom I guide, so ask Me for guidance, and I will guide you. O My slaves, all of you are hungry except those whom I feed, so ask me for food and I will feed you. O My slaves, all of you are naked except those whom I clothe, so ask Me for clothing and I will clothe you. O My slaves, you err night and day, but I forgive all sins, so ask Me for forgiveness and I will forgive you.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to that which no one but Allah, may He be Exalted, is able to do, it is not permissible to seek it from anyone except Allah, may He be Glorified; it should not be sought from the angels or from the Prophets or from anyone else. It is not permissible to say to anyone other than Allah: `Forgive me’ or `Grant us rain or `Grant us victory over the disbelieving people’ or `Guide our hearts’ and so on. Hence At-Tabarani narrated in his Majma` that at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was a hypocrite who used to annoy the believers, so they said: Let us go and seek the help of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) against this hypocrite. So they came to him and he said: “Help should not be sought from me; rather it should be sought from Allah.” (End quote from <em>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</em>, 1/329)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

We will give you this advice and this <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/76010\" target=\"_blank\">etiquette for seeking knowledge</a> ; may Allah cause you to benefit thereby.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"1_ndash_Patience\"><strong>1 – Patience</strong></span></h4>\n<p>My dear brother, seeking knowledge is one of the highest of pursuits, and heights cannot be scaled except by working hard and striving. Abu Tamaam said, addressing himself:</p>\n<p>“Let me scale the heights that cannot be scaled, for reaching high things is difficult whilst reaching low things is easy.</p>\n<p>You want to scale the heights without any effort, but honey cannot be gathered without bee stings.”</p>\n<p>Another poet said:</p>\n<p>“You seek to attain glory, and those who seek to attain glory</p>\n<p>Strive their utmost and roll up their sleeves for that purpose.</p>\n<p>They strive hard but most of them become tired.</p>\n<p>But those who have patience and perseverance attain the heights of the glory that they desired.</p>\n<p>Do not think that attaining glory is as easy as eating dates;</p>\n<p>You cannot attain glory until you swallow the bitterest medicine.”</p>\n<p>So be patient and persevere. If jihaad requires an hour of patience, then the seeker of knowledge must be patient until the end of his life. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning)</p>\n<p><strong>“O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allâh, so that you may be successful.” </strong>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:200]</p>\n<h4><span id=\"2_ndash_Purity_of_intention_in_action\"><strong>2 – Purity of intention in action</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Adhere to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/240287\" target=\"_blank\">purity of intention</a> in what you do. Let your aim be to seek the Face of Allah (i.e., the pleasure of Allah) and the Home of the Hereafter. Beware of showing off and the love of making oneself appear to be superior to one’s peers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks knowledge in order to compete with the scholars or to prove himself superior to the ignorant or to make the people look up to him, Allah will cause him to enter Hell.” (narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2654; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i).</p>\n<p>To sum up, you have to be pure both outwardly and inwardly from every major and minor sin.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"3_ndash_Acting_upon_what_you_know\"><strong>3 – Acting upon what you know</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Know that acting upon what you know is the fruit of knowledge. Whoever knows but does not act upon his knowledge is like the Jews whom Allah likened to the ugliest things in His Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><strong>“The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Tawraat (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, disbelievers)” </strong>[al-Jumu’ah 62:5]</p>\n<p>And whoever acts without knowledge is like the Christians, who are the “daalleen (those who have gone astray)” mentioned in Soorat al-Faatihah. With regard to the books which you should study, they are mentioned in Question # <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20191\" target=\"_blank\">20191</a> ; please refer to this Question as it is important.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"4_ndash_Always_being_aware_that_Allah_is_watching\"><strong>4 – Always being aware that Allah is watching</strong></span></h4>\n<p>You must always be aware that Allah is watching you, in secret and in the open. Your attitude towards your Lord must always be balanced between fear and hope, which for the Muslims are like the two wings of a bird. Turn to Allah wholeheartedly and let your heart be filled with love for Him, your tongue with remembrance of Him (dhikr). Be happy and rejoice in His rulings and His wisdom.</p>\n<p>Always call upon Allah (du’aa’) in every sujood, asking Him to bless you and grant you beneficial knowledge, for if you are sincere towards Allah, He will support you and help you, and will cause you to attain the level of the righteous scholars.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"5_ndash_Make_the_best_use_of_time\"><strong>5 – Make the best use of time</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Make the most of your youth and your whole life by learning. Do not be deceived by procrastination and wishful thinking about the future. Every hour of your life that passes cannot be replaced. Do away with whatever you can of distractions and obstacles which prevent you from striving your utmost to attain knowledge. Hence the salaf encouraged keeping away from one’s family and keeping a distance from one’s homeland, because when a person is distracted he will not be able to understand facts of knowledge and subtle issues. Allah has not given man two hearts in his chest, and similarly it is said that knowledge will not give you a part of it until you give it your all.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"6_ndash_Be_cautious\"><strong>6 – Be cautious</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Beware of being preoccupied in the beginning with the disputes among the scholars, or among people in general, because this confuses the mind. Also beware of musannafaat , because they will waste your time and make you confused. Instead, give your all to the book which you are reading or the topic which you are studying until you become competent in it. Beware of moving from one book to another (before completing the former), for that is a sign of boredom and failure. You must pay attention to each branch of knowledge, in order of importance.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"7_ndash_Precision_and_focus\"><strong>7 – Precision and focus</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Strive to verify that which you want to memorize so that you are certain of it, either from a shaykh or from someone else who can help you. Then memorize it properly and continually repeat it and review at specific times each day, lest you forget what you have memorized.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"8_ndash_Studying_books\"><strong>8 – Studying books</strong></span></h4>\n<p>After you have memorized the summarized books properly, with their commentaries, and you have understood any difficult passages in them and understood the important points, then move on to studying the detailed versions, always reviewing what you have learned and noting the valuable points, subtle issues, strange minor issues, solutions to problems and differences between similar rulings, in all branches of knowledge. Do not think little of anything useful that you learn or any basic principle that you understand; instead, hasten to note and memorize it.</p>\n<p>Let your concern to seek knowledge be uppermost; do not be content to learn only a little when you are able to do more. Do not be content with a little of the legacy of the Prophets (may the blessings of Allah be upon them), and do not delay learning anything that you can, or be distracted or put off by wishful thinking. Delay is a problem, and if you learn something now you can learn something else later.</p>\n<p>Make the most of your time, when you are free and when you are busy. Make the most of your youth when your mind is fresh and you have less distractions, before you become distracted by false ambitions and the desire for worldly possessions.</p>\n<p>You should try to obtain as many of the books you need as you can, because they are the tools of learning. Do not make getting and keeping a lot of them (without benefiting from them) the only share of knowledge that you have, and collecting them the only share of understanding that you have. You also have to use and benefit from them as much as you can.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"9_ndash_Choosing_companions\"><strong>9 – Choosing companions</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Strive to choose righteous friends who are preoccupied with seeking knowledge and are of a good nature, who can help you in achieving your aim, add to the benefits you have already gained, encourage you to seek more knowledge and stop you from feeling bored and tired; friends who are religiously-committed, trustworthy and of good character, who are sincere towards Allah and who are not merely messing about. (See Tadhkirat al-Saami’ by Ibn Jamaa’aah).</p>\n<p>Beware of the bad companion, for he may influence you and people are like birds, they will resemble one another [i.e., “birds of a feather flock together”]. So beware of mixing with people like that, for that is a sickness, and prevention is better than cure.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"10_ndash_Finally_good_manners_towards_the_shaykh\"><strong>10 – Finally, good manners towards the shaykh</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Knowledge cannot be gained only from books; you must also have a shaykh whom you trust to open the door to knowledge and keep you from making mistakes. So you must have good manners towards him, for this is the way to success, learning and strength. So you must honour, respect and be polite to the shaykh. Observe the utmost standards of etiquette when you sit with your shaykh and speak with him. Ask questions in a proper manner and listen attentively. Be polite when studying the book with him and do not try to argue with him or compete with him. Do not initiate conversation with him or walk ahead of him or speak too much in his presence, or interrupt him or interrupt him when he is teaching. Do not pressurize him to give you an answer, and avoid asking him too many questions, especially in front of other people, for this will make you appear to be showing off and make him bored with you. Do not call him directly by his name or nickname; rather say “O my shaykh” or “O our shaykh” (Yaa shaykhi or Yaa shaykhanaa)</p>\n<p>If you think that the shaykh has made a mistake, do not let that make him lose respect in your eyes, because that will deprive you of his knowledge. Who is there who is entirely free from error? See Hilyat Taalib al-‘Ilm by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to make you and us strong and steadfast, and to let us see the day when you will become one of the scholars of the Muslims and an authority in the religion of Allah and one of the imaams of the pious.&nbsp; Ameen, ameen.. We hope to meet soon, and peace be upon you.</p>\n<p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>\n",
