      "title": "Can I ask for a divorce because of my resentment towards my husband?",
      "question": "<p>I am suffering a lot of problems with my husband, which is because we are not getting along, especially since he is too busy at work, which requires him to spend a lot of time outside the home. I feel resentment towards him when he tries to get close to me, and sometimes I hate him, especially when he wants to have sex repeatedly and without any consideration for my feeling exhausted because of housework or because of severe sickness, even if I have a fever or am menstruating. Is this sufficient grounds for me to get a divorce, especially as I cannot carry on in this marriage to him?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It may be important here to remind the     questioner that for every problem there is a remedy and a solution, and     divorce may in fact be a solution to complex problems in marriage, and it is     for that reason that Allah has prescribed it. However, there is no doubt     that every smart person should regard it as being like painful cauterisation     which a sick person may have no choice but to undergo. As the Arabic proverb     says: The remedy of last resort is cauterisation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But before thinking of this     “cauterisation” it is essential to exhaust all other possible means of     reaching a deal that both spouses can agree to, whereby the problems will be     reduced and harmony will increase. Only then will one’s conscience be at     peace and one will be certain of the right decision that one may have to     take in order to find a solution.</p>\n<p>    It is most likely that the sister who     asked this question has heard or read a great deal of advice concerning this     matter, but that should not prevent us from offering her advice that may     provide her with another angle from which to examine the issue. Our advice     is that she should weigh up the pros and cons, and evaluate the possible bad     consequences that may convince a person of the right decision, rationally     and emotionally, with regard to breaking the ties of marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    One calm and quiet discussion – in many     cases – may be sufficient to bring about reconciliation between two gravely     dissenting parties. It is also guaranteed to pave the way towards complete     harmony and understanding. But unfortunately most people do not realise that     and they do not try to achieve it; rather they soon feel despair and give up     hope, because of the failure of one or two or more attempts. However the     wise person is the one who regards establishing a successful and happy     marriage as a challenge that he should try hard to meet, and he should not     be too hasty in announcing its failure, especially as human relations are     always subject to turmoil and ups and downs. In this way one may acquire     experience and attain the qualities of deliberation and calmness that will     help to ensure that any subsequent relationship may be successful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shar‘i reasons cannot occur in isolation;     rather each spouse should check himself or herself and watch out for     shortcomings with regard to his or her duties towards Allah. Perhaps a sin     that was committed may result in consequences that affect the individual     with regard to his or her family and household. Sin is the root of all     problems, and repentance and praying for forgiveness are at the root of all     remedies. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to fear     Him in dozens of places in his Holy Book, and he has made success and     prosperity in this world and the Hereafter dependent upon achieving this     important goal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted,     says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Keep your duty to     Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth.</p>\n<p>    H e will direct you to do righteous     good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His     Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) he has indeed achieved     a great achievement (i.e. he will be saved from the Hell-fire and made to     enter Paradise)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Ahzaab 33:70-71]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe (in Moosa (Moses)     (i.e. Jews) and ‘Eesa (Jesus) (i.e. Christians))! Fear Allah, and believe     too in His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), He will give you a double portion of     His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight),     and He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hadeed 57:28]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And if the people of the towns had     believed and had the Taqwa (piety), certainly, We should have opened for     them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the     Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn     (polytheism and crimes, etc.)”</p>\n<p>    [al-A ‘raaf 7:96].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If living with one’s spouse is becoming     impossible and there is no more room for mutual understanding or treating     one another on the basis of kindness and honouring mutual rights, then there     is no blame on the wife if she seeks divorce.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have     mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If problems have begun to appear between     the couple and the woman can no longer give the man his rights and she     resents him, or she cannot live with him any more, then she has the right to     release herself from him by giving back what he gave her, and there is     nothing wrong with her giving that to him or him accepting it from her.     Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):     “And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of     your Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of     marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they     would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g. to deal with each     other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep     the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she     gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul (divorce)” [al-Baqarah     2:229].</p>\n<p>    End quote from Tafseer al-Qur’an al-‘Azeem     (1/613)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is proven in the Sunnah that the     wife of Thaabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah     be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with     Thaabit regarding his religious commitment or his attitude, but I hate to go     back to kufr after coming to Islam. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Will you give his garden back to him?”     She said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) said (to Thaabit): “Accept your garden, and divorce her (one talaaq).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5273)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That is, I do not want to leave him     because of any bad attitude on his part or shortcoming in his religious     commitment. The report of Ayyoob mentioned above adds: But I cannot stand     him. … In fact another reason was stated clearly, which is that he was     physically ugly.&nbsp; In the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from     his grandfather – which was narrated by Ibn Maajah – it says: Habeebah bint     Sahl was married to Thaabit ibn Qays, who was an ugly man. She said, O     Messenger of Allaah, by Allaah, were it not for fear of Allaah, when he     enters upon me I would spit in his face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The words “but I hate to go back to kufr     after coming to Islam” mean: If I stay with him, I would hate to do anything     that could lead to kufr. … It is as if she was hinting that her intense     dislike for him could lead her to make a show of kufr so that her marriage     to him would be annulled. She knew that this was haraam, but she was afraid     that her intense dislike would make her do that. Or it may be that what she     meant by kufr here was ingratitude to her husband, when falling short with     regard to her husband’s rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Fath al-Baari     (9/399-400)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    However, we should point out to the     questioner here that with regard to her husband’s desire for intercourse     during her menses it is not permissible for her to obey him in that regard;     rather she has to refuse and tell him that this is haraam. If he does not     pay attention to that and transgresses the limit set by Allah with regard to     this matter, then this alone is sufficient grounds for separation. In fact     Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the     husband repeatedly has intercourse with his wife during her menses, and he     does not pay heed, then they should be separated, as we said with regard to     a husband who has anal intercourse with his wife and does not pay heed.</p>\n<p>    End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah     by al-Ba‘li (27)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answers to questions no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/99870\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">99870</a>     and     <a href=\"/ar/answers/\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">117185</a></p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>‘Uzayr is a Jewish name but it is mentioned in the Qur’aan in the context of condemning the Jews, when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And the Jews say: ‘Uzayr (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths…” [al-Tawbah 9:30]</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah: “The well known view is that ‘Uzayr was one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel.” On this basis there is nothing wrong with calling him ‘Uzayr, so long as there is no inclination of the heart towards the Jews, and so long as one is not influenced by them because of being their neighbour. The scholarly differences as to whether ‘Uzayr was actually a Prophet or not are well known.</p>\n",

      "title": "Wants to marry a\r\n    girl but his father does not approve of her",
      "question": "<p>I have chosen a religious and<br />\n      well-mannered girl to be my wife, but when I told my father about this, he rejected the<br />\n      idea. I have tried to convince him but he is insisting. I wanted to know why, but he said<br />\n      there is no reason why. I am confused. Should I obey my father and forget about the girl I<br />\n      have chosen even though this will cause me and my family so much pain? I hope that you<br />\n      will advise of the right thing to do. May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet  (peace and blessings of    Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother    what he likes for himself.”</p>\n<p>It is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so    that you will understand what is going on. </p>\n<p>Our advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and    avoid division, then do so.</p>\n<p>But you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to    help you make the right choice.</p>\n",

      "title": "Advice to one who wants to get married but is not able for it",
      "question": "<p>In the mosque we had a program where the Muslim youth could discuss with those who are older the ahaadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning marriage, and the fact that they should make it easy for the youth to get married. This subject led to a number of discussions, because the parents are concerned about the situation and welfare of the couple, especially if they have children. <br />\n<br />\nYoung people nowadays do not complete their university studies until the age of 21, or 23 for those who study medicine. They cannot afford the expenses of marriage. So what practical advice can you give them? Many of the Muslim youth in the west want to complete half of their religion.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Discussing Islamic matters and spending time     on that is one of the most beneficial things that a person can do for himself, because seeking knowledge is an obligation and an act of worship,     and he is spending time in doing something that is of benefit to him and to others. If the people who are discussing do not understand something,     then they have to ask people who have knowledge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice to those who live in the lands of     immorality and kufr is to migrate from them to the Muslim lands where the temptations of this world and of women are less. The Muslim countries     are not equal in that regard, so he has to choose the best of them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise them to leave every environment in     which he may stumble and fall, whether that is his accommodation, his work or his school/college.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise them to hasten to marry, and to     choose righteous wives who do not make extravagant demands with regard to the mahr, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise those who are unable to get married     to fear Allaah and not to look at or listen to haraam things, not to walk towards haraam things, not to touch that which it is not permissible for     him to touch. They should help themselves in this regard by fasting and praying, making du’aa’, and keeping company with righteous people. They     should keep themselves busy with beneficial things such as seeking knowledge, memorizing Qur’aan and making du’aa’ to Allaah, for if a person     keeps busy in obeying Allaah, that will distract him from disobeying Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advise to community leaders and parents     and guardians of boys and girls is not to regard completion of studies as an impediment to marriage. Since when is marriage an obstacle to     acquiring knowledge?! Rather reality and experience point to the opposite, because marriage helps a person to focus and makes his mind clear, and     above all that it is obedience to the command of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the youth to get married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So parents and guardians should not burden     the youth with excessive demands that may be regarded as a form of extravagance. They should limit the demands to that which the woman and the     house need only. They should understand that marriage is one of the means by which provision is sought. Allaah says (interpretation of the     meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no     husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor,     Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people)”</p>\n<p>[al-Noor 24:32]</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Do weight loss injections invalidate the fast?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to take injections for weight loss half an hour before Iftar, knowing that they are administered either in the stomach, thigh, or arm, and they release a hormone in the body that helps to increase insulin levels; to enhance the metabolic rate, assist in eating a smaller quantity of food, and to suppress appetite<span>?</span></p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Weight loss injections, which are one of the therapeutic techniques that help reduce weight, rely on injecting the body with the substance liraglutide, a protein similar to carbohydrates that affects neural receptors in the brain, working to suppress appetite and reduce sugar intake.</p>\n<p>Saxenda injections work to lower blood sugar levels by preventing the body from secreting the hormone glucagon, which affects sensory receptors in the brain, thereby reducing appetite for food and increasing the feeling of fullness. Consequently, the rate of fat burning in the body increases, and it is converted into the energy needed by the body. End quote.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>These injections are neither food nor drink, nor do they serve as a substitute for them, meaning they are not nutritious, and therefore they have no effect on fasting.</p>\n<p>Since they help suppress appetite, they are not considered the same as nutritious injections.</p>\n<p>It is stated in \"Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da'imah\" (10/252):</p>\n<p>\"It is permissible for a fasting person to be treated with injections in the muscle or vein during the daytime in Ramadan.</p>\n<p>However, it is not permissible for a fasting person to take nutritional injections during the daytime in Ramadan; because it is similar to consuming food and drink, and taking such injections is considered a trick to break the fast in Ramadan.

      "title": "He hates life and wishes for death",
      "question": "<p>What is the Islamic ruling on a man who hates this life very much, and asks Allah to cause him to die if that is good for him, and he is waiting for death?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to hate life and despair of what Allah, may He be exalted, could grant him of relief and good health. What is required of him is to bear with patience whatever he is facing of what Allah has willed and decreed, and to seek reward with Him, may He be exalted, for what befalls him of calamities, and to ask Him, may He be glorified, to avert that from him, to help him and to reward him for what He decrees should befall him of that. And he should wait for relief from Allah, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.&nbsp; Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease” [ash-Sharh 94:5-6]</em>. It is makrooh for a Muslim to wish for death because of some harm that befell him, such as sickness, hardship or anything else. In <em>as-Saheehayn</em> it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death because of some harm that befalls him. But if he must do that, then let him say: ‘O Allah, cause me to live so long as life is good for me, and cause me to die so long as that is good for me.’” From the wording of the hadith, we understand that this is a kind of delegating one’s affairs to Allah and submitting to His will and decree. Whatever befalls a Muslim of calamities in this world is an expiation for him, if he seeks reward for that with Allah, may He be exalted, and does not become discontent. This is a wake-up call to turn away from heedlessness, and a lesson for the future.</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength.

      "title": "Ruling on defaming and exposing offences committed by non-Muslims",
      "question": "<p>One of my non-Muslim work colleagues was caught red-handed trying to defraud a citizen, and he took some money from him unlawfully, by abusing his position at work. During the court proceedings against him, he was still coming to work, taking advantage of the fact that the manager at work is a close friend of his, and he is also a non-Muslim. I spoke against him in front of others and in his presence, without addressing him directly, but I mentioned him by name and I mentioned his abhorrent actions and denounce his evil deeds, especially since we are sure that the manager will try to protect him from any punishment imposed by the law. Some of my Muslim colleagues objected to my speaking against him and said: Islam does not enjoin us to do that, because it is blameworthy schadenfreude, and Allah prefers concealment in such situations, and I was hurting his feelings, and it was sufficient that he felt ashamed and embarrassed with us, so we should console him and not expose him. Please explain what we should do in such situations.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The one who is caught red-handed trying to defraud someone deserves punishment, and he must return what he took unlawfully. This is something that is to be decided by the judicial authorities, or by the departmental body that has the authority to question him.</p>\n<p>It is not appropriate to expose him or tell everybody of his misdeeds, unless he did it blatantly and recklessly, or there is the fear that he could defraud or cheat more people, if people are not aware of him and if he appears to be persisting in committing his misdemeanours.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the concealment that is required in this case, what is meant by that is concealment of those who appear to be good people and the like, who are not known to be evildoers or mischief makers.</p>\n<p>As for one who is known for being like that, it is recommended that his situation should not be concealed; rather his case should be referred to the authorities, provided that there is no fear of any negative consequences, because concealing in this case will encourage him to do more harm and spread more mischief, and transgress the sacred limits, and it will encourage others to do likewise. End quote from Sharh Muslim (16/135).</p>\n<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone is well known for committing sins, and does so openly, and does not care what he commits of sins or what is said about him, then he is an evildoer who commits evil openly, and talking about him and his misdeeds is not regarded as backbiting, as al-Hasan al-Basri and others stated. With regard to such a person, there is nothing wrong with investigating and finding out about him, so that the hadd punishments may be carried out against him. That was stated clearly by one of our companions, and he quoted as evidence for that the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “O Unays, go to the wife of that man in the morning, and if she admits it, then stone her.” There can be no intercession for such a person if he is caught, even if the authorities are not informed; rather he should be left so that the hadd punishment may be carried out against him, in order to put an end to his evil and to deter others like him.</p>\n<p>Maalik said: If someone is not known to cause harm and offence to people – rather he made a mistake – there is nothing wrong with interceding for him, provided that news of his case has not reached the authorities. But if he is known for evildoing and mischief, I would not approve of anyone interceding for him; rather he should be left so that the hadd punishment may be carried out against him. This was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir and others. End quote from Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (1/341).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by concealing is hiding faults, concealing is not something praiseworthy unless it serves an interest and will not lead to evil consequences. For example, if an offender commits an offence, we do not conceal him if he is known to be an evildoer and mischief maker. But in the case of a man who appears to be good, then he did something that is not permissible, concealment may be what is required in his case. So concealment depends on what interest is to be served; the person who is known for evildoing and mischief should not be concealed, whereas in the case of one who appears to be good but made a mistake, the Sunnah is to conceal his mistake.

Ibn Hibbaan included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled, “The Fire is the lot of the one who says things to offend the People of the Book,” in which he quoted the hadith of Abu Moosaa, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Whoever says something offensive to a Jew or a Christian will enter the fire.” This hadith was classed as saheeh by Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq Ibn Hibbaan, and by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, no. 3093.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar al-Haytami said in az-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir (2/27): al-Ghazaali was asked in his Fataawa about backbiting about a disbeliever.</p>\n<p>He said: On the part of the Muslim it is forbidden for three reasons: hurting the feelings of a fellow human; belittling the creation of Allah, for Allah is the Creator of people’s deeds; and wasting time on something that is of no benefit.</p>\n<p>He said: The ruling on the first is that it is haraam, on the second that it is makrooh, and on the third that it is other than what is more appropriate.</p>\n<p>With regard to the dhimmi [a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], he is like the Muslim in that no one should hurt him, because Islam has protected his honour, his life and his wealth. It says in al-Khaadim: The first reason is the correct reason [i.e., the first reason – which is that it is hurting the feelings of a fellow human – is the real reason why it is forbidden].</p>\n<p>Ibn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says something offensive to a Jew or a Christian will enter the fire.”</p>\n<p>What is meant in this hadith is saying something to annoy or offend him. This settles the matter, because it clearly indicates that it is haraam to do that.</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazaali said: As for the harbi [a non-Muslim whose people are at war with the Muslims], it is not haraam with regard the first reason, but with regard to the second and third reasons it is makrooh.</p>\n<p>As for the innovator, if his innovation constitutes disbelief, then he comes under the same ruling as the harbi; otherwise, he comes under the same ruling as a Muslim. As for speaking about him in the context of his innovation, that is not makrooh.

      "question": "<p>Assalam alaikum,<br />\nThe question has arisen due to many needy Muslims who are being thrown<br />\nout of schools due to lack of tuition. There are many Muslims who have bank<br />\naccounts which give interest, and they have not been using it as interest is<br />\nharam. What should one do with the interest. Should he leave it to the bank<br />\nor can it be used for such case as paying the tuition to the non Islamic<br />\ninstitutions ?<br />\nPlease give valid reasons. This question is very important and urgent as the<br />\nacademic term has just started and funds are not available. <br />\nJazakawallahu Kheiran,</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>and may His peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Muhammad  and on his family and companions.</p>\n<p>To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani , May Allah safeguard you , Judge of Nairobi - Kenya </p>\n<p>May Allaah’s peace and blessings be upon you.</p>\n<p>I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what scholars have mentioned: </p>\n<p>If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the purification of one’s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and good.</p>\n<p>This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc… Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is considered as lost money that no one owns.</p>\n<p>Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims.</p>\n<p>Reference: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/401-411, \"What should one do who repents from earning forbidden money\", Al-Fawzaan.</p>\n",

      "title": "With regard to wiping over the head cover for a woman, are the same conditions stipulated as for wiping over the khuffs?",
      "question": "<p>What are the rulings for a woman wiping over her head cover when doing wudu? Are they the same as the rulings on wiping over the socks?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>We have previously discussed the ruling on wiping over the head cover, and the difference of scholarly opinion concerning that, in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/148129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">148129</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Those Hanbali scholars who say it is permissible for a woman to wipe over her head cover, say that it comes under the same ruling as the khuffs and socks, so they stipulated that it must have been put on when in a state of purity, and said that the time period during which it is permissible to wipe over it is the same as that for the khuffs and socks.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the ruling on wiping over the turban:</p>\n<p>The ruling on the turban with regard to the time period during which it is permissible to wipe over it, and the stipulation that it should be put on when one is in a state of purity, and that the state of purity is broken if it is taken off, is the same as the ruling on khuffs, because they are both to be wiped over when purifying oneself, on the basis of comparison.(<em>Al-Kafi</em>, 1/39).</p>\n<p>But it does not seem that this view is correct, because neither the head cover nor the turban come under the same ruling as the khuffs. Therefore what is stipulated in the case of the head cover and turban is not the same as what is stipulated with regard to wiping over the khuffs, and drawing an analogy with the khuffs is far-fetched. The original ruling regarding the feet is that they are to be washed [when doing wudu], in contrast to the head, regarding which the original ruling is that it is to be wiped. Moreover, only the top of the khuff is to be wiped, but wiping over the head cover is not like wiping over the khuffs; rather the correct view is that the entire head is to be wiped, whether all of it is uncovered or covered, or part of it is uncovered and the other part is covered.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>There is no reason in common between the rulings on wiping over the turban or head cover and wiping over the khuffs. Rather the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that one must be in a state of purity when putting on the khuffs in order to be able to wipe over them, but he did not make any such stipulation in the case of the turban and head cover. Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {… that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl 16:44], {And never is your Lord forgetful} [Maryam 19:64]. If that were required with regard to the turban and head cover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have explained it as he explained that with regard to the khuffs. The one who says that the turban and head cover are the same as the khuffs in this regard is making a claim with no proof, and he must provide proper evidence to support this claim. So it should be said to him: How do you conclude from the Prophet’s words about wiping over the khuffs and the requirement to be in a state of purity before putting them on that this also applies to the turban and head cover? There is no way to come up with such an argument except on the basis of individual opinion, which carries no weight. Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {Produce your evidence if you are telling the truth} [Al-Baqarah 2:111].</p>\n<p><em>Al-Muhalla</em>, 1/310.</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If someone were to say: Because wiping over the khuffs is permitted for a specific time limit when travelling and for a different specific time limit when not travelling, then wiping over the turban should be likewise, this is a claim for which there is no proof of its soundness, and a statement for which there is no evidence that it is obligatory. It should be said to him: What is your evidence to prove what you are saying about the ruling for wiping over the turban being the same as the two times mentioned with regard to wiping over the khuffs? This is something for which there is no proof at all except his statement. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his turban and head cover, and he did not stipulate a time limit for that as he did for wiping over the khuffs. Therefore we must say what he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, and not say anything about issues of religion that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never said. Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not transgress them} [Al-Baqarah 2:229].</p>\n<p><em>Al-Muhalla</em>, 1/310.</p>\n<p>There is not even a single soundly-narrated religious text stipulating that the turban must be put on when in a state of purity in order to be able to wipe over it, and there is no time limit regarding that for one who is not travelling or one who is travelling. What has been narrated concerning that is weak (da`if), such as the hadith of Abu Umamah, which says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wipe over his khuffs and turban for three days when travelling and for one day and one night when not travelling.</p>\n<p>Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>But its chain of narrators includes Marwan Abu Salamah. Ibn Abi Hatim said: He is not strong. Al-Bukhari said: His hadith is odd. Al-Azdi said: He is nothing. Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about this hadith and he said: It is not authentic.(<em>Nayl al-Awtar</em>, 1/204).</p>\n<p>See also the answers to questions no.&nbsp; <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/129557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">129557</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/72391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72391</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/139719\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">139719</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The Jews had Saturday, and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and Allah guided us to Friday. So there is Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and we will be dealt with before all others.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Muslim, 856)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Al-Qadi said: The apparent meaning is that it was obligatory for them to venerate Friday but this was not stated clearly; the matter was left to their own reasoning… But they did not manage to work it out and Allah did not guide them to it. It was enjoined clearly upon this ummah, and was not left to their own reasoning, thus they were blessed with it … It was narrated that Musa enjoined Friday upon them and told them of its virtues, but they disputed with him and argued that Saturday was better, and it was said to him, ‘Let them be.’ Al-Qadi said: if there had been a clear command, their arguing with him would not have been valid, rather it would have been said to him that they were going against the command. I say: it may be that that was clearly enjoined upon them but they disputed as to whether it was something they had to adhere to or they could change it to another day; they decided to change it to another day and they erred greatly thereby.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that Friday was specifically enjoined upon them and they went against that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz said: “How can it be otherwise when they are the ones who said “We hear and we disobey”?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aws ibn Aws narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On that day Adam (peace be upon him) was created; on that day he died; on that day the Trumpet will be blown and on that day all of creation will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings upon me, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings upon you be shown to you when you have turned to dust?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets, peace be upon them.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1047; classed as sahih by Ibn al-Qayyim in his comments on Sunan Abi Dawud, 4/273; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 925)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted to Paradise and on it he was expelled therefrom.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Muslim, 1410)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith includes some of the reasons why Friday is regarded as special. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The apparent meaning is that these virtues do not mean that Friday is regarded as special because Adam was expelled on a Friday and the Hour will begin on a Friday. Rather it is meant to explain what momentous events took place and will take place on this day, so that people will make the most of this day to do righteous deeds, so as to attain the mercy of Allah and ward off His punishment.&nbsp; This is the view of al-Qadi. Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said in his book al-Ahwadhi fi Sharh al-Tirmidhi: All of these events are good and add to the virtue of Friday. The expulsion of Adam from Paradise is the reason why his offspring and the messengers, the prophets, the righteous and the awliya exist. He was not expelled from it as such, but rather it was for a purpose, then he will return to it. With regard to the Hour beginning on a Friday, the reason is so that the reward may be hastened for the prophets, believers in truth, awliya and others, and their honour and high status may be made manifest. This hadith points to the virtues of Friday and its high status in relation to the other days.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Lubabah ibn ‘Abd al-Mundhir said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Friday is the master of days, and the greatest of them before Allah. It is greater before Allah than the day of al-Adha and the day of al-Fitr. It has five characteristics: on this day Allah created Adam, on it He sent Adam down to the earth, on it Allah caused Adam to die, on it there is a time when a person does not ask Allah for anything but He gives it to him, so long as he does not ask for anything haram, and on it the Hour will begin. There is no angel who is close to Allah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain and no sea that does not fear Friday.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1084; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, no. 2279)</p>\n<p>Al-Sanadi said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“They fear Friday” means they fear the onset of the Hour.

      "question": "<p>“Ahmad” has two wives, the first one cannot have children and the second one can have children, praise be to Allah. In the modern scientific age doctors can, by the grace of Allah, put an egg from the second wife with the husband’s sperm (test-tube baby) and mix them and let them start to grow, then place (the fertilized egg) in the womb of the wife who cannot have children, so that the child can grow until he is born. Is this permissible in the light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah? Some people say that it permissible by analogy with breastfeeding, i.e., just as it is permissible to nourish a child with her milk in her lap, it should also be permissible for her to nourish him with her blood in her womb.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This method of fertilization, which involves placing the egg with the husband’s sperm in the womb of the other wife, is a method that is not acceptable according to sharee’ah, and a large number of scholars are of the view that it is haraam. Statements were issued concerning it by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League. Those who initially said that this method was permissible later retracted their view. There follows some of what was said in those statements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The meeting of the Islamic Fiqh Council held on 8 – 13 Safar 1407 AH (11–16 October 1986).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After examining the subject of artificial fertilization –“test-tube babies” – by studying the research presented and listening to comments of experts and doctors, and after discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The methods of artificial fertilization that are known nowadays are seven:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in his wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>ii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm of a man other than the husband and the wife’s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>iii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, and the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to carry it (surrogate motherhood).</p>\n<p>iv.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of strangers, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>v.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.</p>\n<p>vi.Where sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, and fertilization occurs outside the womb, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>vii.Where sperm is taken from the husband and placed in the wife’s vagina or uterus so that fertilization may take place inside her body.</p>\n<p>It was determined that the first five methods are all haraam according to sharee’ah and are forbidden completely in and of themselves, or because of the results to which they will lead, such as mixing of lineages, loss of motherhood and other things that are forbidden according to sharee’ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the sixth and seventh methods, the committee thinks that there is nothing wrong with resorting to them in cases of need, after emphasizing that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majallat al-Majma’ (3/1/423).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 –Statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>and blessings and peace be upon our Master and Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session held at the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, from Saturday 18 Rabee’ al-Aakhir until Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985), examined the remarks submitted by some of its members concerning what the Council had declared permissible … with regard to artificial fertilization and test-tube babies, which was issued in its seventh session, held between 11-16 Rabee’ al-Aakhir 1404 AH, where it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the couple and, after fertilization in a laboratory vessel, the embryo is implanted in the womb of another wife of the same man, as she volunteers to carry this pregnancy of behalf of her co-wife whose womb has been removed – it seems to the committee that this is permissible in cases of need and subject to the general conditions mentioned previously.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The remarks may be summed up as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other wife in whose womb the embryo from the egg of the first wife is implanted may become pregnant with a second child before the embryo becomes established in her womb, as the result of relations with her husband around the time of the implanting of the embryo, then she may give birth to twins and it may not be known which child resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which resulted from relations with the husband, and it may not be known which wife is the mother of the child who resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which is the mother of the child who resulted from relations with the husband. Similarly, one of the two embryos may die at the ‘alaqah or mudghah stage but not be expelled from the uterus until the other child is born, and it may also not be known whether he is the child that resulted from the (implanted) embryo or from relations with the husband. This means that there is confusion as to who the real mother is and there is mixing of lineages which affects a number of rulings. All of this means that the Council must retract their rulings in the case mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Council has also listened to the opinions presented by doctors and obstetricians who attended the meeting and who pointed to the possibility of the other pregnancy being miscarried as the result of marital relations with the woman who is carrying the embryo, and confusion of lineages as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After a discussion of the matter and an exchange of opinions, the Council decided to retract the view that the third type mentioned is permissible, and in the seventh session, 1404 AH.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Qaraaraat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi (pp. 159-161).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to take the husband’s sperm and the wife’s egg and put the mixture in the womb of another wife of the husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to stipulate that the borrower must pay the difference in value if the currency drops?",
      "question": "<p>I am student in a British university. As a British student, the government here gives me a loan to complete my study. This loan is not interest-based, as it is mentioned in the terms and conditions. It will be also considered cancelled after 25 years of taking it. It must not be paid unless the student starts working with a salary of at least 15 000 pound a year. But it includes what is called inflationary interest, meaning that if the currency price drops by 0.01%, then I will have to pay this difference. <br />\n<br />\nI have asked a lot, many fatwa councils in Europe said that it is permissible loan, as well as many scholars did. But some scholars said it is haram, I do not know what to do?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible for     the one who borrows money from anyone to commit himself to repaying the loan     based on the value of the currency at the time when the loan is repaid,     rather he must repay the loan with the same value as it had at the time he     took it. This is the view of the majority of scholars both classical and     modern, and it is what is stated in fatwas issued by contemporary fiqh     councils. This applies if the currency remains in circulation, even if the     exchange rate changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the currency is     abolished altogether and the people no longer use it, in this case there are     different scholarly opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars say that the     borrower must pay back the value at the time of the loan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some say that what counts     is its value at the time the currency is abolished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Others say that what     matters is its value at the time of paying it off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih     al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The view that is most     likely to be correct is the view that what counts is the value at the time     the currency is abolished, because he was responsible to pay ten fuloos [a     kind of currency] until it was abolished, i.e., if he had asked him for ten     fuloos one minute before it was abolished, he would have given him ten     fuloos, and it would have been binding on the lender to accept it. So if     that is the case, we should estimate the value to be paid at the time when     it is abolished. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti’     (9/104).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the ruling in the     case of the currency being abolished and another being used instead. But if     the currency is still valid and people are still using it, then it must be     repaid as it is, even if the rate of exchange is different and even if the     purchasing power has changed, and even if there is inflation. This is stated     in a report by the International Islamic Fiqh Council which belongs to the     Organization of the Islamic Conference, which is sufficient and good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Statement no. 115 (9/12)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Re:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inflation and change in     currency values&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Journal of the     International Islamic Fiqh Council which belongs to the Organization of the     Islamic Conference in its eighteenth session held in Riyadh, in the Kingdom     of Saudi Arabia, 25 Jumaada al-Aakhirah&nbsp; – 1 Rajab 1421 AH (23-28 September     2000 CE).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After studying the closing     statement of the Economic Fiqh Council for the Study of Inflation (in its     three sessions in Jeddah, Kuala Lumpur and al-Manaamah) and its     recommendations and suggestions, and after listening to the discussions on     this topic with the members and experts of the Council and a number of     fuqaha’, the following has been determined:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Affirmation of the     previous decision, no. 42 (4/5) which reads as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What matters with regard     to repayment of undisputed debts in a certain currency is that they should     be paid in the same currency, not the equivalent value, because debts are to     be paid off in the same form as the loan was given. It is not permissible to     connect debts owed, regardless of the nature of the debt, to changes in the     level of prices.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – In the event that     inflation is expected at the time of signing the contract, the contract may     be drawn up based on a currency or form of wealth other than that which is     expected to fall, such as basing the contract on the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (a)Gold or silver</p>\n<p>    (b)A similar product</p>\n<p>    (c)A basket (group) of similar     products</p>\n<p>    (d)Another, more stable currency</p>\n<p>    (e)A basket (group) of currencies</p>\n<p>Payment of the debt in the     examples given above must be in the same form as that on which the loan was     given, because the borrower is not obliged to pay back anything more than     what he actually received.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These cases are different     from the case which is forbidden, whereby the two parties involved in the     transaction do the deal on the basis of giving in one currency on condition     that the debt is paid back in another currency or a basket (group) of     currencies. The prohibition on this type of loan was issued in the Council’s     statement no. 75 (6/8).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – It is not permissible     in sharee’ah to agree when drawing up the contract to connect payment of the     debt to any of the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (a)a mathematical formula</p>\n<p>    (b)the index of living expenses or     any other index</p>\n<p>    (c)gold or silver</p>\n<p>    (d)the price of a specific item</p>\n<p>    (e)the average gross domestic     product</p>\n<p>    (f)another currency</p>\n<p>    (g)the rate of interest</p>\n<p>    (h)the average price of a basket     (group) or products</p>\n<p>That is because this kind     of connection may lead to many types of risk and unknown factors, to such an     extent that neither party knows what is owed or expected to be paid, so the     condition of clarity which is required for contracts to be sound will not be     met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If these things to which     the debt is connected increase in value, that will result in differences     between what is owed and what is expected to be paid, and if the contract is     based on that, it is riba. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This statement by the Fiqh     Council is in accordance with that which was stated in fatwas by the     Standing Committee, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Muhammad ibn     Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee for     Issuing Fatwas said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The borrower must pay the     pounds that he borrowed at the time when the lender asks for them, and the     difference in purchasing power does not affect anything, whether it has     increased or decreased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Lajnah     al-Daa’imah (14/146).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also the answer to     question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/23388\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">23388</a>, as it     deals with a similar question. The two answers complement one another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on handing the remote to<br />\n      your mother/father to put music on t.v?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Turning up the volume of music for one’s parents with    a remote control</p>\n<p>That is not permissible because it involves cooperating in sin, and    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“… but do not help one another in sin and    transgression.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>If you withhold the remote control and they get angry, they have no    right to do so, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:    “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the    Creator.” </p>\n<p>(Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 1041; it is a saheeh hadeeth).    </p>\n<p>The remote control you mention is merely a tool, the    person who is doing the action is you, and the responsibility rests with you. You have to    call your parents to give up evil things, inviting them with wisdom and beautiful    preaching, addressing them kindly and lowering to them the wing of humility. If Allaah    told Moosa and Haaroon to address the kaafir tyrant Pharaoh with kindness, as He said    (interpretation of the meaning), “And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept    admonition or fear (Allâh).” [Ta-Ha 20:44] – then your parents are more    deserving of being addressed mildly and gently. May Allaah guide us all to the path of    those who fear Him.</p>\n",

      "title": "Divorcing (talaaq) three times based on a belief that it is obligatory",
      "question": "<p>Me and my wife have had a rough couple of years. We got divorced when we both had little knowledge of this religion. For the first time she is willing to work out are marriage and I thank Allah that she has been thinking about this. It is imperative that this question be answered for me because it involves a family being united or seperated. When we first got seperated someone told her that you have to give talaq 3 times, so i gave her the first talaq willingly from my heart. After that we tried to work it out, But someone told her that it is obligatory to give the 2nd talaq even if one does not want to after 3 months and a 3rd one is obligatory after 6th months. So I was angry and didnt bother researching and asking about this. So when the 3 months were over i gave the second talaq without really wanting to but i thought i had to. When the 6 month came, i thought it was a sin upon me if i did not give it to her because this is what a view ignorant people told her and myself. So i waited longer then the 6 months sad that i was forced to give her the last one knowing she will not be available to me unless she marries, so out of anger and sadness i gave her the third talaq because i was told it was obligatory on me to do so. After that we were apart for a year since then but i always wanted to work it out. When i started studying fiqh under shayukh and in the masjid they told me to relate to them how i did my talaq. I told 3 or 4 people and they said subhanallah you may still be married if you thought you had to give the third. So now i relate my question to a proper scholar. We both now want to work it out, but this one last steps in the way. We live far apart now and I havent seen my son in 2 years because of no travel money and the only way to see him is to live with her and him again. So I wanted to know if she is still lawful for me because we both want to work it out. No shaykh has answered my question and i need an answer quickly, and i fear i may follow my desires if i do not get a response because i havent found any answer related to my situation.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If you only uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) on the second or third occasion because you believed that it was obligatory, as you had been told, then this talaaq does not count as such according to the more correct opinion, because if a person bases his talaaq on a reason, then finds out that that reason was not valid, his talaaq does not count as such.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have received your letter in which you ask about your divorce (talaaq) of your wife and you said that you heard something about her and you got angry and divorced her three times (threefold talaaq), then after that you found that the news you had heard was false and you became certain that it was not true, and you are asking whether this divorced counts as such or not, because it turned out that she is innocent of what was said about her.</p>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<p>If the situation is as mentioned and you only divorced her based on this false news, then the correct scholarly opinion is that this divorce does not count as such. Based on that, the divorce is invalid and your wife is permissible to you on the basis of the first marriage contract. There is no need to go through the process of taking her back or do a new marriage contract.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, 11/ question no. 3159</p>\n<p>See also question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/36835\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">36835</a></p>\n<p>The one who told you that made a serious mistake and spoke about Allah without knowledge.</p>\n<p>For a woman who menstruates, her ‘iddah is three menstrual cycles, not three months. If her husband gives her a revocable divorce and does not take her back during the ‘iddah, she becomes completely divorced and is not permissible for him except with a new marriage contract.</p>\n<p>As it has become clear that your second and third talaaq do not count as such, but you did not take your wife back during her ‘iddah following the first talaaq, then she has become completely divorced from you and cannot go back to you except with a new marriage contract that fulfils the necessary conditions.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

That excludes the reports that speak of the physical description of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); but this exclusion is only when talking about the Sunnah in the context of it being one of the sources of Shari`ah. In that context, the reports that speak of his description are not part of the Sunnah; rather the Sunnah is only based on his words, deeds and approval.” (Tahrir `Ulum Al-Hadith)</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the names of the saved group, the group that will continue to adhere to the commands of Allah, is “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12761\" target=\"_blank\">Ahl Al-Hadith</a> .” They are also called “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10777\" target=\"_blank\">Ahl As-Sunnah</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The books that deal with the transmission of reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Companions, and the words of the righteous early generations, are called “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/239540\" target=\"_blank\">Kutub Al-Hadith</a> ”; they are also called “Kutub As-Sunnah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Places_where_Hadith_and_Sunnah_mean_different_things\">Places where Hadith and Sunnah mean different things</span></h3>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term Sunnah is applied to the Prophet's (may the peace and blessings of Allah be on him) guidance which is well-established in a general sense in all of his affairs, meaning his path, his methodology and his way. In this context, scholars do not usually use the term “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/197164\" target=\"_blank\">Hadith</a> .” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-`Allamah As-Sayyid Sulayman An-Nadwi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>““Hadith” refers to every incident that is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), even if he only did it once in his life, and even if it was narrated from him by only one person. With regard to the word “Sunnah,” in reality it is used for his actions – I mean how the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) did things – that has been transmitted to us via mutawatir actions, in the sense that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did it, then the Companions did it after him, then the Successors did it after them, and so on. It does not necessarily mean that there is a narration describing that action; rather this refers to the way in which a particular act was performed and was passed down through the generations by means of tawatur (i.e., passed down by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could have all agreed upon a lie).&nbsp; This is what is called “Sunnah,” and this is mentioned alongside the Book (the Quran) in the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “I am leaving among you two things and you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger.” This is what it is not permissible for any Muslim, no matter who he is, to forsake or go against, otherwise he has no share in Islam.” (Majallat Al-Manar, 30/673)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scholars use the word <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/89878\" target=\"_blank\">“Sunnah” to describe adhering to Islam</a> in the manner prescribed, without adding to it or introducing innovations into the religion; they do not call that “Hadith.” For example, `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi Al-Mashhur said: Sufyan Ath-Thawri is an imam (leading scholar) in Hadith, but he is not an imam in Sunnah; al-Awza`i is an imam in Sunnah but he is not an imam in Hadith. Maik ibn Anas is an imam in both. (Tarikh Dimashq by Ibn `Asakir, 35/183)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Abu `Amr ibn As-Salah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of them said of Imam Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that he combined knowledge of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/604\" target=\"_blank\">Sunnah</a> and of Hadith; what is the difference between the Sunnah and Hadith?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah be pleased with him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In this context, Sunnah is the opposite of bid`ah (innovation). A person may be a scholar of Hadith yet also be an innovator. Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) combined both Sunnahs; he was a scholar of the Sunnah, i.e., Hadith, and also believed in the Sunnah, i.e., his way was that of Ahl al-haqq (the people of truth), with no bid `ah (innovation). And Allah knows best.” (Fatawa ibn As-Salah, 1/139-140)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurists use the word “Sunnah” when explaining the ruling on doing a specific action as being mustahabb (liked or encouraged); they do not use the word “Hadith” in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the scholars speak of reports and whether <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/134465\" target=\"_blank\">they are authentic or weak</a> , they only use the word “Hadith”; they do not use the word “Sunnah.” So they say “This is a weak Hadith”; they do not say “This is a weak Sunnah”, because of them the Sunnah is that which is proven in the Hadiths; therefore they sometimes say “This Hadith is contrary to analogy, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The substance that is put in cheese is rennet; it is a yellowish white substance in a vessel of skin which is extracted from the stomach of a calf or nursing lamb. A little of it is added to the milk, which curdles and becomes cheese.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/155).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ruling on rennet varies according to where it is taken from. If it is taken from an animal that has been slaughtered in accordance with sharee’ah, then it is pure and may be eaten. If it is taken from an animal that died of natural causes or an animal that was not slaughtered in accordance with sharee’ah, then there is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ concerning it. The majority of Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is najis. Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, according to the other report narrated from him, were of the view that it is taahir. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). He said in al-Fataawa (21/102): It is more likely that their cheese -- referring to the Magians -- is halaal and that the rennet from a dead animal (one that died of natural causes) and its milk are taahir. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said (35/154): With regard to cheese that is made with their rennet – i.e., from some of the baatini sects who are regarded as kaafirs – there are two well-known views concerning that among the scholars, as in the case of rennet from dead animals and rennet from animals slaughtered by the Magians and Franks, of whom it is said that they do not slaughter meat properly. The view of Abu Haneefah and of Ahmad according to one of the two reports narrated from him is that this cheese is permissible, because the rennet of dead animals is taahir according to this view, because then it does not die when the animal dies. The view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and of Ahmad according to the other report, is that this cheese is najis because in their view the rennet is najis, because the milk and rennet of the dead animal are najis according to them. If meat slaughtered by a particular person cannot be eaten, then meat slaughtered by him is like dead meat. Those who hold both views quoted as evidence reports that were narrated from the Sahaabah. Those who hold the first view narrate that the Sahaabah ate the cheese of the Magians, and those who hold the second view narrate that they ate what they thought was cheese of the Christians. This issue is subject to ijtihaad and one may follow the view of the Shaykh he asks. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the correct opinion. Whether you know the source of the rennet and that it comes from an animal that was slaughtered properly or otherwise, or you do not know, there is nothing wrong with eating cheese that has been made with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Dealing with a company that sells gold by means of pyramid marketing",
      "question": "<p>A company sells gold in a way that if you buy gold for $800 from it, you will be a member in this company. If you bring six buyers and they buy from the company, you will be an affective member and you will have continuous profits from this company forever according to how much it makes. Is it permissible to join this company?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is not permissible to join companies that are based on     pyramid marketing, because this transaction involves gambling and consuming     people’s wealth unlawfully, and tricking and deceiving them by telling them     that they will make unbelievable profits, which are very rarely achieved by     those who join these companies. This has been discussed in detail in the     answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/40263\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">40263</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/42579\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">42579</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/45898\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">45898</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the company sells gold, and the gold does not reach     the purchaser until several days after the contract is done, and this is     another reservation about this company. When selling gold for cash, it is     stipulated that the gold and the money be handed over in the same sitting as     that in which the contract is drawn up, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver,     wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for     like, same for same, hand to hand. If any of these types are different, then     sell however you like, so long as it is hand to hand.”&nbsp; Narrated by Muslim     (2970) from the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased     with him). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Riyals, dollars and other kinds of currency come under the     same rulings as gold and silver, so it is not permissible to buy gold for     any kind of currency unless it is hand to hand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the subscriber is going to pay the price of the gold up     front, then the gold is going to be sent to him by mail, or via a shipping     company, then this means that it is not hand to hand, so this transaction is     haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of these companies offer the option of paying by     instalments, which is another reason why it is haraam, because it is not     permissible to sell gold by instalments, rather it must be sold hand to hand     as stated above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Conclusion: It is not permissible to join companies that are     based on pyramid selling, because their dealings are based on gambling and     consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, and because they involve riba when     selling gold by instalments or when delaying handing over gold until after     the sitting in which the contract is done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on hunting birds during the sacred months or in the sanctuary (al-haram)?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Hunting birds during the sacred months is permissible, because what is forbidden during the sacred months is only fighting. But many scholars, or most of the scholars, say that the prohibition on fighting during the sacred months has been abrogated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the birds are inside the boundary of the sanctuary, then it is not permissible to hunt them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when he conquered Makkah: “Its game is not to be disturbed.” If it is forbidden to disturb the game, then killing is even more forbidden. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in a state of Ihraam [for Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage)]”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:95]</p>\n<p>“Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food — for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel, but forbidden is (the pursuit of) land game as long as you are in a state of Ihraam (for Hajj or ‘Umrah)”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:96].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person is in ihraam or is within the boundaries of the sanctuary, then it is not permissible for him to hunt.

      "question": "<p>We are a group of friends who get together to talk about and discuss worldly and religious matters. In one of our gatherings a question was asked, as follows: Can a Muslim live a 100% Muslim life whilst continuing to live and interact with his society with all the good and bad things that that involves? What I mean is that if he wants to keep away from everything that Allaah has forbidden and enjoy everything that Allaah has permitted in His Holy Book, and follow the Sunnah of His chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in what he has permitted and keep away from that which he has forbidden?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslim is not infallible. Every son of Adam inevitably commits sin and the best of those who sin are those who continually repent, as it says in the hadeeth. But it is possible for the Muslim to live in an Islamic society and adhere to his religion as much as he can, following the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”</p>\n<p>[al-Taghaabun 64:16 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>His religious commitment is not affected by some sins that he may commit without meaning to, or that he thinks are permissible according to his own ijtihaad and reasoning and the information that he has, or that he asked some scholars about and they gave him a fatwa concerning that but the fatwa was not in accordance with sharee’ah. To sum up, what the Muslim has to do is to keep his duty towards Allaah and fear Him as much as he can, to regard as forbidden that which Allaah has forbidden to him, and to strive to do that which Allaah has enjoined upon him. If he slips or stumbles then he must hasten to repent sincerely.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Assalaam alaikum<br />\nI am desiring to embrace Islam, however I have a slight concern. I am legally<br />\nblind and use a guide dog for mobility purposes. I have been informed that I<br />\nhave no problems being a Muslim and having a guide dog due to my<br />\ndisability. However, I am concerned at the reaction that I get from other<br />\nMuslims when I approach an Islamic Center. I do not want to offend but<br />\nwithout the assistance of the guide dog I am unable to travel to a Masjid or<br />\nIslamic center alone. With who should I discuss this situation i.e., an Imam? I<br />\nsometimes feel I am at a \"stalemate\" . <br />\nThank you for your help.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.)</p>\n<p>To the dear noble inquirer:</p>\n<p>You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern over what you may face vis-à-vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is simple and much easier to deal with than you may think.</p>\n<p>You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable according to Islamic shari’ah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing.</p>\n<p>I can’t imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing.</p>\n<p>In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) [translation of the meaning]:</p>\n<p>\"Verily Allaah has said, ‘If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him for them Heaven.’ \" (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653)</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is your opinion of a Jumu’ah khutbah that, along with the prayer, lasts ten minutes?",
      "question": "<p>What do you say about an imam whose khutbah, along with the prayer, takes only ten minutes? Yes, ten minutes! Is this Jumu’ah valid?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that keeping the Jumu’ah khutbah short is indicative of the khateeb’s understanding of Islam, as he can compile many meanings in a few words, and does not speak for so long that the people forget the first things he said by the time he reaches the end. This was the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his regular khutbahs; indeed this is what he enjoined, and it is the best way. Similarly his exhortations were few so that what he exhorted the people could be remembered. So his Jumu’ah khutbahs were short and the exhortations few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Waa’il said: ‘Ammaar addressed us and he spoke briefly but eloquently. When he came down (from the minbar), we said: O Abu’l-Yaqzaan, you spoke eloquently but briefly, would that you had made it longer. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (S) say: “A man’s lengthening his prayer and shortening his khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion), so make your prayers lengthy and your khutbahs brief, for there is charm in eloquent speech.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (869).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are many comments from the scholars to confirm this idea:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>As for making the khutbah short, it is a Sunnah to be followed. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that and did it. According to the hadeeth of ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined making the khutbah short. And he used to give khutbahs with good words and few, and he disliked prattle and long-windedness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars disapprove of exhortations in which some is forgotten because of the length, and they like that in which the listener can focus on what is said and learns from it after memorizing it. That can only occur when the exhortation is brief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Istidhkaar (2/363, 364).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to make the khutbah lengthy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Muhalla (5/60).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is better to keep the khutbah short, because there are two benefits of keeping the khutbah short:</p>\n<p>(i)The listeners do not get bored, because if the khutbah is lengthy – especially if the khateeb delivers it in a boring manner which does not move their hearts and does not motivate them – then the people will get bored and fed up.</p>\n<p>(ii)That makes the listener remember better, because if it is too long, the first part of it is lost by the time he reaches the end, but if it is short, then it is possible to remember it and learn from it. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man’s lengthening his prayer and shortening his khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion),” i.e., it is indicative of his understanding of religion and shows that he pays attention to people’s circumstances. But sometimes there is a need for a lengthy exhortation, and if a person speaks at length because the situation requires that, it does not mean that he is excluded from the description of being one who understands religion, because length and shortness are relative matters. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would sometimes give a khutbah by reciting Soorat Qaaf, and Soorat Qaaf, when recited slowly and carefully (tarteel) and pausing at every verse, takes a long time.</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni’ (5/65).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This keeping the khutbah short should not be done in such a way as to erode the khutbah altogether, so that the people do not benefit at all from the khutbah. They have not travelled long distances or come out of their homes merely to see the khateeb, or to hear the tone of his voice, rather they have come to attain some benefit by hearing his exhortation or an Islamic ruling and so on. Hence attention should be paid to moderation in this matter. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I was praying with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his prayer was moderate and his khutbah was moderate.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (1433).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., it was somewhere between being very long or too short to be any benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (6/159)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is mustahabb to keep the khutbah short, because of the hadeeth quoted above, and so that they do not get bored by it. Our companions said: Keeping it short should be done in moderation, and should not be taken to such extremes that (its benefit) is erased altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Majmoo’ (4/358)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But we cannot say that a khutbah that is very short does not count, when most of the scholars are of the view that if the khutbah contains the essential parts (lit. pillars) then it is valid. There is a great difference of opinion as to the definition of those essential parts. The correct view is that there is nothing that can be called the essential parts or pillars of the khutbah, and everything that may be called a khutbah, even if it is only a few words, is counted as such and is valid as a khutbah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh Ibn Sa’di, whose views we have mentioned in the answer to question no. 115854. In the answer referred to, Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) supported this view, but he pointed out that it should not be followed. Please see his words in that answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This khateeb whose khutbah and prayer together take ten minutes does not have deep understanding of Islam, rather he is ignorant, because understanding of the religion means keeping the khutbah short and making the prayer long, not effectively destroying them both! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let us read what the Khateeb of al-Masjid al-Haraam, Shaykh Sa’ood al-Shuraym, says concerning the length of the Jumu’ah khutbah and prayer, with approximate length of time:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Sa’ood al-Shuraym (may Allaah preserve him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to reach an approximate definition of what is meant by the prayer being long and the khutbah being short in modern terms, I say – and Allaah is the source of strength – &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you recite in Fajr prayer, for example, al-Jumu’ah and al-Munaafiqoon at a moderate speed, the prayer will take you no less than ten minutes, if not fifteen. I tried it and I found that to be the case. All of this applies if you recite at a moderate speed, with the rukoo’ (bowing) and sujood (prostration) of the prayer. So how about if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was following the command of his Lord, “And recite the Qur’aan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style” [al-Muzzammil 73:4], and he used to make the bowing, rising, prostration and sitting between two prostrations lengthy, and the narrator of the hadeeth said: “to such an extent that one would think he had forgotten”? In the hadeeth of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him) it says: The prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his bowing, and when he raised his head from bowing, and when he prostrated, and the time between two prostrations were all nearly the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shaamil fi Fiqh al-Khateeb wa’l-Khutbah (p. 154)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From this it is clear that it is not possible for this khateeb to deliver the Friday khutbah and offer the Jumu’ah prayer in ten minutes, unless there is clear undermining of both matters, the khutbah and the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such a person needs to be told, because perhaps he may have misunderstood something from the Sunnah with regard to this matter, so he is spoiling both the khutbah and the prayer, whilst thinking that he is one of those who do good!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he does not respond to your telling him, then look for someone else who establishes the Sunnah in a proper way or close enough, and pray with him, and protect your prayer, and keep your heart sound. As for him who does not learn and does not want to, leave him to his own devices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

A woman with dark cheeks stood up in the midst of the women and said, ‘Why is that, O Messenger of Allah?’ He said, ‘Because you complain too much and are ungrateful to your husbands.’ Then they started to give their jewellery in charity, throwing their earrings and rings into Bilal’s cloak.” (Narrated by Muslim, 885)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Lessons_for_Muslim_women\">Lessons for Muslim women</span></h3>\n<p>Our believing sisters who learn of this Hadith should behave like those female Companions who, when they learned of this, did good deeds which would be the means, by Allah’s leave, of keeping them far away from being included in that majority of the inhabitants of Hell<span>. </span></p>\n<p>So our advice to the sisters is to strive to adhere to the rituals and obligatory duties of Islam, especially prayer, and to keep away from that which Allah has forbidden, especially shirk in its many forms which is widespread among women, such as seeking one's needs from someone other than Allah, going to practitioners of witchcraft and fortune-tellers, etc<span>.</span></p>\n<p>We ask Allah to keep us and all our brothers and sisters far away from the Fire and the words and deeds that bring one close to it<span>.</span></p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/344118\" target=\"_blank\">344118</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22836\" target=\"_blank\">22836</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114050\" target=\"_blank\">114050</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/608\" target=\"_blank\">608</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/149336\" target=\"_blank\">149336</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96619\" target=\"_blank\">96619</a> <span>.</span></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best<span>.</span></p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on allocating some mosques for i‘tikaaf and not others",
      "question": "<p>In our country the state allocates some mosques for people to observe i‘tikaaf in, and there are other mosques that are not allocated for i‘tikaaf. There are some people who want to observe i‘tikaaf in these mosques, I mean the ones that are not allocated by the state. Are the employees of these mosques sinning if they prevent these people from observing i‘tikaaf there, in accordance with the instructions of the government? Are they included in the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allaah’s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations) in Allaah’s mosques” [al-Baqarah 2:114]? If they are sinning by doing that, what about obeying the authorities? Especially since there are other mosques allocated for i‘tikaaf. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Mosques are the most honoured places on Earth; they are the     houses of Allah and were built for His worship by praying, reading Qu’'aan,     remembering Allah, seeking and teaching Islamic knowledge, and i‘tikaaf.     Concerning this, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     said: “… rather they [mosques] are for the remembrance of Allaah, may He be     glorified and exalted, and prayer, and reading Qur’aan.” Narrated by Muslim     (285).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Every Muslim has the right to enter the mosques and worship     Allah there, so long as he does that in the prescribed fashion. Based on     that, whoever wants to observe i‘tikaaf in some mosque has the right to do     that, and no one has the right to prevent him from doing so. The one who     prevents him may be included in the meaning of this verse (interpretation of     the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And who are more unjust than those who forbid that     Allaah’s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations)     in Allaah’s mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such     should themselves enter them (Allaah’s mosques) except in fear. For them     there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the     Hereafter”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:114].</p>\n<p>    i.e., no one is more unjust than those who do this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This prohibition is reinforced if it is done because these     people who are observing i‘tikaaf are keen to follow the Sunnah and warn     people against innovation and tell them not to cause mischief on earth, so     restrictions are put on them to prevent them from observing i‘tikaaf in the     houses of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Whoever strives -- in this case -- to prevent people from     observing i‘tikaaf and staying in the mosques to pray, read the Qur’aan and     remember Allah, is sinning and comes under the warning mentioned in this     verse. The one who helps him to do that is like him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the employees of the mosques, if they can take a     stance for the sake of Allah against preventing people from observing     i‘tikaaf in the mosques unjustly, this is what they should do, and they     cannot afford to do anything else. If they cannot do that, then they should     be gentle with the one who wants to observe i‘tikaaf and ask him to change     his mind, because it is not wise for a person to observe i‘tikaaf in the     mosque and thus cause harm to his Muslim brothers.</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;It may be better for him and for the Muslims to observe     i‘tikaaf in the mosques where i‘tikaaf is permitted, so that a large number     of Muslims will come together, and perhaps that will be a means of teaching     them some Islamic rulings that they do not know, or one of them may receive     sincere advice (naseehah) that will benefit him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Prohibiting i‘tikaaf in some mosques may be acceptable if the     mosque is small and does not have enough room for the worshippers, in which     case observing i‘tikaaf there would bother the worshippers and make the     place even more overcrowded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Does repentance bring back the reward for what was lost because of showing off?",
      "question": "<p>If someone does do a good deed with an intention other than to please Allah, then he or she repents, will he get the rewards after the repentance?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    There is evidence in the Sunnah to indicate that if a person     did a righteous deed whilst he was a kaafir, then he repented and became     Muslim, there will be recorded for him after his repentance the reward of     the righteous deeds that he did before, as if he did them in Islam. This is     the great generosity of Allaah and His immense bounty and kindness. Although     some scholars disagreed with that, this is the correct view and it is the     apparent meaning of the saheeh Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased     with him) that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think of     things that I did as acts of worship during the Jaahiliyyah such as giving     charity, freeing slaves and upholding the ties of kinship – is there any     reward for them? The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah be     upon him) said: “You have become Muslim with all your previous virtues.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1436) and Muslim (123).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Haafiz ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him)     said, commenting on this hadeeth:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a person did a righteous deed, then he did a bad deed     which cancelled it out, then he repented, then the reward that was lost     because of his bad deed will be restored to him. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fath al-Baari by Ibn Rajab     (1/146)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the hypocrite or show-off repents, does he have to repeat     (prayers etc), or will his repentance have the effect of reversal on the     deeds he did before that, so that he will be rewarded for them, or is it     that he does not have to repeat anything and will not be rewarded?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for repeating, the hypocrite does not have to do it at     all, because a group of hypocrites repented from hypocrisy at the time of     the Messenger of Allaah and he did not order any of them to repeat. And     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “and they could not find any cause to do so except that     Allaah and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If then they     repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away; Allaah will     punish them with a painful torment in this worldly life and in the     Hereafter”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tawbah 9:74]</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the hypocrite is inwardly a kaafir, so when he     believes he is forgiven what he did before, so he does not have to make     anything up, just as that is not required of the one who was outwardly a     kaafir when he becomes Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to his reward for what he did before, when he     repents he is like the kaafir if he did righteous deeds when he was a kaafir     then became Muslim -- will he be rewarded for it? In al-Saheehayn it     is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him)     said to Hakeem ibn Hizaam: “You have become Muslim with all your previous     virtues.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the show-off, if he repents from showing off,     even though he believed it was obligatory, then it is similar to the issue     of what we are speaking of here, which is the issue of one who did not carry     out an obligatory duty, even if he was not inwardly a kaafir; obliging him     to make ups or repeat things is a major deterrent to repentance. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (22/20-21)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He also said (may Allaah have mercy on him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The one who repents from sin is like the one who did not sin,     and if the sin is erased then the punishment and consequences are also     erased. Negation of good deeds is one of the consequences of sin. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sharh al-‘Umdah (1/39).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Chapter: if his recent bad deeds supersede his past good     deeds and cancel them out, then he repents sincerely from them, his good     deeds are restored to him and he does not come under the same ruling as one     who starts all over again, rather it is said to him: You have repented on     the basis that what you did previously of good deeds (will be kept for you).     The good deeds that he did in Islam are greater than the good deeds that the     kaafir did when he was a kaafir, such as freeing slaves, giving charity and     upholding the ties of kinship. Hakeem ibn Hizaam said: O Messenger of     Allaah, what do you think of things that I did as acts of worship during the     Jaahiliyyah such as giving charity, freeing slaves and upholding the ties of     kinship – is there any reward for them? The Messenger of Allaah (blessings     and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “You have become Muslim with all your     previous virtues.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That is because sins that come between two acts of obedience     are erased by means of repentance, so it becomes as if they never happened,     and the two acts of obedience come together and will be counted together.     And Allaah knows best. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Madaarij al-Saalikeen (1/282)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The extent to which delaying prayer may be forgiven in the case of women",
      "question": "<p>Is a Muslim woman who prays at home considered to be sinning if she delays praying Zuhr until half an hour or a quarter of an hour before the adhaan of ‘Asr, or she prays ‘Asr half an hour or a quarter of an hour before the adhaan of Maghrib, or if she prays ‘Isha’ half an hour before the adhaan of Fajr? If the answer is that this is not permissible, what is the extent to which delaying the prayer may be allowed without incurring any sin?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible to delay prayers beyond the time when they are due, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:103]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As‑Salaah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”&nbsp;[Maryam 19:59]</p>\n<p>Islam has told us the times of the prayers, as described in the hadeeth which was narrated by Muslim (217) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet who said: “The time of Zuhr is so long as the time for ‘Asr has not begun, and the time for ‘Asr is so long as the sun has not begun to turn yellow, and the time for Maghrib is so long as the afterglow has not faded, and the time for ‘Isha’ is until midnight, and the time for Fajr is so long as the sun has not yet risen.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9940\" target=\"_blank\">9940</a> we have explained the times of the five daily prayers in detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is sufficient here to mention the end of the time for each prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for Zuhr is when the time for ‘Asr begins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for ‘Asr is when the sun starts to turn yellow; the time is extended in cases of necessity, such as when a person is sick, etc., to when the sun sets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for Maghrib is when the red afterglow disappears from the sky, which is the beginning of the time for ‘Isha’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for ‘Isha’ is midnight (halfway through the night), and it does not last until the time when dawn begins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for Fajr is when the sun rises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is permissible to offer the prayer at any point within the time for that prayer, whether at the beginning, in the middle or at the end. It is not permissible to delay any of these prayers until after its time is over without a valid excuse such as sleeping or forgetting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, praying Zuhr half an hour or a quarter of an hour before ‘Asr is valid, and there is no sin on you in that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to ‘Asr, you must pray it before the sun turns yellow, and the timing of that varies from one season to another. It seems that quarter of an hour before Maghrib the sun will have turned yellow, so the time for ‘Asr will be over.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for you to delay ‘Isha’ until half an hour before Fajr, because the time for ‘Isha’ is up to midnight, as it says in the hadeeth. If you want to work out when midnight is, then calculate the time from sunset until dawn, and half way between the two is the end of the time for ‘Isha’ (this is midnight). If the sun sets at five o’clock and the adhan for Fajr is given at five o’clock, then midnight (or half way through the night) is eleven o’clock at night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is better to hasten to perform the prayers when the time for them begins, because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (496) and Muslim (122) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Which deed is most beloved to Allah?” He said: “Prayer offered on time.” He said, “Then what?” He said, “Honouring one’s parents.” He said: “Then what?” He said, “Jihad for the sake of Allah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

In some of these poor families there are individuals (men and women) who are able to work, but they have got used to receiving charity every month, and they have started to refuse work if it is offered to them. The jobs that they have refused include sewing, working as a janitor, working in a school, and selling food in the school or neighbourhood. <br />\n<br />\nMy question is: <br />\n<br />\nBy giving this money, have we handled it in the proper way?

      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What you are doing of sponsoring a number of poor families is     a good deed for which you are to be thanked, and we ask Allah to accept it     from you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What people give of charity is of two types:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1.</p>\n<p>    Obligatory charity, namely zakaah. It is not permissible to     give this to anyone except those whom Allah mentioned in the verse     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the     Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect     (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined     (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for     Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and     for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty     imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tawbah 9:60]</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to give zakaah to one who is able to     work and earn enough to suffice him, because the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no share of it [zakaah] for the     one who is independent of means or one who is strong and able to earn a     living.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1633; classed as saheeh by     al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 876.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2. </p>\n<p>    Mustahabb charity, which is what a person gives other than     zakaah. It is permissible to give this to both poor and rich, but it is     better to give it to the one who is in need of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is     permissible to give voluntary charity to the rich, and there is no     difference of scholarly opinion on this point. It is permissible to give it     to them and the giver will be rewarded for it, but it is better to give it     to the needy. Our companions said: It is better for the rich person to     refrain from taking it and he should not ask for it, and it is not     permissible for the rich person to accept voluntary charity, making a show     of being poor.

Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:65].</p>\n<p>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his <em>Tafsir</em>, 2/349:</p>\n<p>Regarding the words {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them}: here Allah, may He be exalted, swears by His divine essence that no one truly believes until he refers judgement to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him in all his affairs, for whatever he rules is the truth which the believer must accept wholeheartedly, both inwardly and outwardly. Hence Allah says: {then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}. That is, when they refer to you for judgement, then they must obey you inwardly and not feel any reservations about your verdict, and they must submit to it both outwardly and inwardly. So they should submit to it completely, without any reluctance, objection or dispute, as it is narrated in the hadith: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of you truly believes until his inclinations are in accordance with what I have brought.” (End quote)</p>\n<p>In his beneficial and blessed book <em>Riyadh as-Salihin</em>, Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled: the Chapter on the command to adhere to the Sunnah and the etiquette learned therefrom.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, he quoted a number of verses from the Quran which are indicative of this important principle of faith, as clear evidence in which there is no confusion or doubt:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{Whatever the Messenger gives you [of the gains, or of instructions], accept it, and whatever he forbids to you, refrain from it}&nbsp;[al-Hashr 59:7]</p>\n<p>{nor does he speak of his own accord;</p>\n<p>It is but divine inspiration}&nbsp;[an-Najm 53:3-4]</p>\n<p>{Say: If you love Allah then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins}&nbsp;[Al `Imran 3:31]</p>\n<p>{Verily, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example for those who look with hope to Allah and the Last Day}&nbsp;[al-Ahzab 33:21]</p>\n<p>{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:65]]</p>\n<p>{If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:59].</p>\n<p>The scholars said: What is meant is referring to the Quran and Sunnah.</p>\n<p>And Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:80]</p>\n<p>{And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path,</p>\n<p>The path of Allah}&nbsp;[ash-Shura 42:52-53]</p>\n<p>{So let those who go against his command beware lest some calamity strikes them or a painful punishment befalls them}&nbsp;[an-Nur 24:63]</p>\n<p>{And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom}&nbsp;[al-Ahzab 33:34]</p>\n<p>and there are many similar verses. (End quote).</p>\n<p>In the same chapter, he also quoted a number of hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which affirm this principle. These hadiths include the following:</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” It was said: Who would refuse, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari) It is very strange for someone to claim that following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not obligatory, when Allah, may He be exalted, has connected guidance and success to following and obeying him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided}&nbsp;[al-A`raf 7:158]</p>\n<p>{If you obey him, you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}&nbsp;[an-Nur 24:54].</p>\n<p>One of the things that the Muslim must believe is that the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is his path – meaning his words and actions regarding religious matters – is infallible.</p>\n<p>If the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a decision on the basis of his personal opinion, and it turned out to be incorrect, revelation would come down straightaway to correct it and show what Allah wanted and what His ruling was concerning a specific, new development. This is what is proven in the Quran, in passages such as the following:</p>\n<p>{It is not befitting for a Prophet to take captives until he has thoroughly suppressed [the enemy] in the land. You desire the fleeting gains of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise.</p>\n<p>Were it not for a prior decree from Allah, a grievous punishment would have befallen you for what you took [of ransom].</p>\n<p>So enjoy what you have gained in war as lawful and good, but fear Allah; verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}</p>\n<p>[al-Anfal 8:67-69]</p>\n<p>{It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire</p>\n<p>And the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient}&nbsp;[at-Tawbah 9:113-114]</p>\n<p>{O Prophet, why do you prohibit [for yourself] that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>Allah has already prescribed for you a way of releasing yourselves from your oaths. Allah is your Guardian, and He is All-Knowing, Most Wise}&nbsp;[at-Tahrim 66:1-2].</p>\n<p>Conclusion: the one who raised this objection has not understood anything about following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the importance thereof in the religion of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He has not understood the evidence that points to that, and when he objected to this fundamental principle, he has not objected with something that will benefit him or that has anything to do with the issue under discussion.</p>\n<p>Would that this doubter, if he is confused about something, would refer the matter to people of authority, such as the scholars and jurists, so that they could respond to the doubt that he has in his mind.</p>\n<p>May Allah show us the path of guidance and enable us to follow it.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I want to ask about protein made from the hemp plant, which can be found in sporting goods stores in the UK. Is it permissible to consume this protein as a natural source of energy? This substance does not contain THC.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-‘Arabiyyah al-‘Aalamiyyah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Hemp (also known as Cannabis) is a plant that is sometimes     cultivated for its strong fibres, which are obtained from the woody stems of     the plant and are used in making string and various kinds of rope.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Growing hemp is banned in most countries because it is     possible to obtain a psychoactive substance from it, known as marijuana or     hashish. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The cannabis plant has a serious effect on the body, hence     the fuqaha’ in the past and at present have stated that it is forbidden to     consume it, as has also been stated by legal systems worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/66227\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">66227</a></p>\n<p>    The psychoactive substance in cannabis that has an effect on     the brain and nervous system is that which the questioner referred to by its     acronym THC, which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is known that this psychoactive substance is not present     in leaves other than the flowering or fruiting tops, and it is not present     in the seeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The military doctor Muhammad Fathi ‘Eed (may Allah guide him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The cannabis plant is one of which cultivation is banned in     accordance with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, which was     ratified by the Protocol of 1972. That is with the exception of a small     quantity that a country that is signatory to the Convention may need for     scientific research purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Convention clarified in clause (c) that what is meant by     “cannabis” is any plant of the genus Cannabis, whether it is male or female,     cultivated for the production of fibre or the production of drugs…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs it says:     “Cannabis” means the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant     (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops) from which     the resin has not been extracted, by whatever name they may be designated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Convention stated that this definition does not include     cannabis leaves that are not attached to the tops and it does not include     the seeds. End quote from Jareemat Ta‘aati al-Mukhaddiraat fi’l-Qanoon     al-Muqaaran, 1/145, 146&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if the protein that is derived from the     cannabis or hemp plant is taken from one of these two things – other than     the flowering tops and seeds – which are in fact free of THC, then there is     nothing wrong with consuming it, so long as it does not have a negative     effect on the body apart from what may be caused by the psychoactive     substance. This is the general condition that applies to everything that is     available in the market of natural or manufactured substances that claim to     benefit the body by increasing energy.

      "question": "<p>I am a muslim residing currently in the lands of disbelief,I was born and brought up in the west. I recently made an intention to do hijra to the lands of islam and muslims and Allah be praised and glorified, i managed to raise some money for my journey, the problem that Im facing and I pray to Allah that you can help me, is that I had a problem with a sin and everytime I committed it, I would regret it, and I would repent, but I would always go back to it and this became a big problem for me, so in order for me to stop I made an oath out of desperation, and I said \" O Allah if I commit this sin again, then I will give the money which I raised to do hijra with, away in charity and I will not offer the expiation for it (kaffarat yameen). (Meaning even if I had a choice to give an expiation, I wouldnt. oblighing myself to give the money)But out of stupidity and foolishness i did it again. what can i do? should i give the money and start raising the money again or could i repent for my mistakes and head towards perparing for hijra in the way off Allah ? .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      You did well when you formed the intention to leave that       country and migrate to a Muslim country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because you were able to collect the money needed for travel,     but you swore that oath, intending to prevent your self from going back to     that sin, then you were overwhelmed by your nafs and you went back to it,     now you have to continue with your plan to migrate and you should not let     the oath that you swore hold you back. What is prescribed in the case of one     who swears an oath then thinks that something else is better than it, is to     do what is better and to offer expiation for his oath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no doubt that the purpose of migration and the good     consequences that will result from it, such as keeping away from temptation     and its people, takes precedence over the harm caused by breaking an oath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Lawgiver takes into consideration the pros and cons, and     when there is a&nbsp; case in which there are pros and cons, the definite pros     take precedence over the uncertain cons. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 24/269&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (6718) and Muslim (1649) narrated from Abu Moosa     al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allaah, if Allaah wills, I do not     swear an oath (to do something) then see something better than that, but I     expiate my oath and do that which is better.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Muslim (1650) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be     pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah     be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath (to do something) then sees that     something else is better than it, let him do that and offer expiation for     his oath.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In these hadeeths there is an indication that if a person     swears to do something or not to do something, but breaking his oath is     better than going ahead with it, it is mustahabb for him to break his oath     and he has to offer expiation for that. This is something on which there is     scholarly consensus. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So hasten to leave that land and move to a Muslim country.     This will be more beneficial for you and will be more effective in helping     you to adhere to the straight path than forcing yourself by means of oaths     that you are not able to fulfil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to be sincere in repentance and turning to Allah,     and you have to think positively of Him and renew the covenant by coming     back to Him. Do not lose hope in Him, for no one who pins his hope on Allah     will ever be disappointed. And do not despair of the help and mercy of     Allah. Resolve to strive hard and turn to your Lord with a heart full of     fear and hope.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Remember the words of Allah, may He be exalted     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Say: O 'Ibâdî (My slaves) who have transgressed against     themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of     Allâh, verily Allâh forgives all sins.

      "title": "Is it permissible to delay paying the price of gold and the cost of having it made into jewellery?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to give some money to a craftsman to make jewellery on the basis that the rest will be given to him when he finishes it, knowing that the first amount is not being used to buy the gold?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    What we understand from the question is that you are going to     buy the gold from this craftsman, and he will make it into jewellery. If     that is the case, it is not permissible, rather what you should do is pay     the price of the gold (in cash) and take possession of the gold in one     sitting. As for the cost of making it into jewellery, it is permissible to     delay it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if what is meant in the question is that you are going to     give the craftsman gold that you already own, so that he can make it into     jewellery, then there is nothing wrong with delaying payment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for     wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like,     same for same, hand to hand.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) said: “Whoever gives more or asks for more has engaged in     riba.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) was brought some good-quality dates. He asked about them and     they said: “We used to take one saa’ for two saa’s, and two saa’s for     three.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered     that the transaction be cancelled and he said, “This is the essence of     riba.” Then he told them to sell the inferior dates and to buy good-quality     dates with the dirhams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From these ahaadeeth we may understand that what the     questioner said about exchanging gold for gold and adding the cost of making     one of them into jewellery is something that is forbidden and is not     permissible. It comes under the heading of riba which the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade. The correct way to do     it is to sell the broken gold for a certain price without any other     conditions. After the seller has taken the price, he may then buy the new     gold. It is better to look for the new gold in another place, and if he     cannot find it then he may return to the one who bought from him, and buy it     with dirhams. If it costs more it does not matter. What matters is that     there should not be an exchange of gold for gold with an extra payment, even     if that is for making it into jewellery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This applies if the seller is a merchant. If the merchant is     also a goldsmith he can say: “Take this gold and make it into jewellery for     me (whatever he wants him to make), and I will pay you for that when you     finish making it.” There is nothing wrong with this. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ As’ilah fi Bay’ wa Shira’ al-Dhahab     (no. 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Shaykh was also asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is it essential to pay for work when collecting the gold (to     the goldsmith) or can we regard it as an ongoing transaction?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It does not have to be     paid up front, because this is payment for work. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ As’ilah fi Bay’ wa Shira’ al-Dhahab     (no. 10). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My brother-in-law had a miserable married life for last two years. his wife used to behave badly with him and the worst thing the girl used to torture /abuse her mother-in-law .<br />\n<br />\nAfter many tormenting and disgusting discussions the boy,his mother, his father and his sister decided divorce is the only solution and he divorced. Please clarify whether the stance taken was right or not? .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The basic principle concerning divorce is     that it is makrooh. This is indicated by the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait for four months,     then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>227.&nbsp;And if they decide upon divorce, then     Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:226]</p>\n<p>With regard to the oath not to have sexual     relations, Allaah says “Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”, but with regard to divorce, He says, “All-Hearer, All-Knower”. This contains     an element of warning, and this indicates that divorce is makrooh or disliked by Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there may be some situations in which there is no alternative to divorce, and matters     may reach a point where divorce becomes essential. In a situation such as that mentioned in the question, divorce is an appropriate solution,     because one of the rights that a husband has over his wife is that she should respect his family, especially the husband’s mother. The mother’s     rights over a man come before his wife’s rights, so the wife should help her husband to honour his mother.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that divorce is permissible in     cases where it is needed because of the wife’s bad attitude and bad conduct and because she is causing too much harm and not doing what she is     supposed to do. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mughni,     10/324&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

Thus they came from the same source, and as that is the case there cannot be any contradiction or conflict between them, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.} [An-Nisa’ 4:82]</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, describes the Glorious Quran as “confirming” the Books that came before it, and that which confirms something cannot contradict or conflict with it.

It is because these two Books have fallen prey to distortion and alteration, with things being taken away, added and changed. That is in addition to the fact that the sources and manuscripts that have come down to us today cannot be trusted.</p>\n<p>This is what explains any differences that researchers or students find between these two Books and the Glorious Quran which has been transmitted to us in a Mutawatir fashion (i.e., narrated by so many from so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie), as is attested by both believers and nonbelievers.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Biblical_Mentions_of_Ibrahims_Journey_to_Makkah\">Biblical Mentions of Ibrahim’s Journey to Makkah</span></h3>\n<p>Nevertheless we say that Ibrahim’s arrival in the land of Makkah Al-Mukarramah – and indeed his building of the Sacred House – are historical events that are attested to in the Torah and other ancient historical books.</p>\n<p>We cannot deny the fact that there are different interpretations of these texts of the Torah and so on, and that the context is open to different interpretations. Our aim here is to confirm that such indications exist. However, the matter should be left to scholars to examine the story in the Old Testament, in order to reach a definitive conclusion.</p>\n<p>These references include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the book of Genesis 16:7 it says, after mentioning the story of Ibrahim (Abraham) going in unto Hajar (Hagar) and her becoming pregnant, then Sarai’s [Sarah’s] complaint to Ibrahim about her:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Biblical quotations in English are taken from the King James Version (KJV); some place names have been changed, followed by the place name, in brackets, that is mentioned in the KJV.

And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>13&nbsp;And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</p>\n<p>14&nbsp;Wherefore the well was called Be’er lahai roi (Well of the Living One Who sees me); behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>\n<p>See how the name of the Hijaz is mentioned, and Hajar’s departure to that place, after which the blessing of the “Well of the Living One Who sees me” is bestowed by Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted; this is the Well of Zamzam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 13:1-18 it says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, towards the Qiblah (into the south).</p>\n<p>2&nbsp;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p>\n<p>3&nbsp;And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</p>\n<p>4&nbsp;Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>18&nbsp;Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 20:1 it also says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the land of the qiblah (the south country), and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>\n<p>We have quoted these texts [in the original Arabic of this article] from the Torah as translated into Arabic by Sa`id Al-Fayyumi, (d. 943 AH); the King James Version of the Bible has been used here].</p>\n<p>He was the first one to translate the Old Testament into Arabic. He also wrote a commentary for most of its books.

Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in Al-Jawab As-Sahih liman baddala Din Al-Masih, 5/200):</p>\n<p>There is no difference of opinion between the Muslims and the People of the Book concerning the fact that Paran is Makkah. But if they say that it is not Makkah, there is nothing strange in that, because they are known for their distortions and fabrications.</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said concerning the region around Mount Hira’ in Makkah:</p>\n<p>That place is called Faran (Paran) to this day. (End quote)</p>\n<p>Abdul Haqq Vidyarthi (d. 1978 CE) stated in his famous book Muhammad in World Scriptures:</p>\n<p>In the Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch (Torah), which was published in 1851 CE, it says that Paran is located in the Hijaz, as follows:</p>\n<p>“And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 21:21).</p>\n<p>This translation remained in circulation for a long time, but when the Muslims alerted the Christian world to this prophecy, and that it constituted testimony to the truth of this Noble Prophet, the translation was changed. End quote</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Old Testament, in Psalms 84:5-6, 10, there is mention of the valley of Baca. This passage, in the King James Version (KJV), reads as follows:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5&nbsp;Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>\n<p>6&nbsp;Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>10&nbsp;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand (elsewhere).</p>\n<p>There is no valley on earth called Baca (or Bakkah) that contains a house of worship and a spring of water (Zamzam), in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, other than Makkah Al-Mukarramah.</p>\n<p>Baca (Bakkah) is one of the names of Makkah. This name is mentioned in the Glorious Quran, where Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning)”</p>\n<p>{Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-`Alamin (the mankind and jinns).} [Al `Imran 3:96]</p>\n<p>But the translators and commentators of the Old Testament distorted the word Baca to buka’ [weeping or crying; the Hebrew cognate denotes the same meaning], even though the meanings of place names should not be translated; rather the name should be transliterated, and even though the meaning of the (original) name has nothing to do with crying or weeping, as a result of their desire to eliminate all references to anything that is proven in the Glorious Quran, such distortions occurred.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we say:</p>\n<p>Even if nothing was mentioned in the Old Testament concerning Ibrahim’s journey to the Hijaz, that does not indicate that this journey did not happen at all.</p>\n<p>The well-known academic principle says that the fact that a thing is not mentioned does not mean that it did not happen. In other words, denying that something happened should take the form of a negative statement.</p>\n<p>The fact that no mention is made of its happening does not necessarily mean that it did not happen; rather the reason why it was not mentioned may be that it was omitted, forgotten, summarized in brief, and the like.</p>\n<p>If you find news of something in one newspaper, then you find that it is not mentioned at all in another newspaper, the fact that it is not mentioned in the latter does not mean that it did not happen. Whoever thinks in such terms is lacking in reason and is making no sense.</p>\n<p>This is also applicable in the case under discussion here.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we were to quote the words of non-Muslims who have investigated the story of the Ka`bah and who really built it, and have determined that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is the one who built it, this article would become far too long. But we will limit ourselves to quoting one of the most famous of contemporary history books, The Story of Civilization, by Will Durant. This book is composed of forty-two volumes in which the author discusses the history of most civilizations, including the history of the Arabian Peninsula, concerning which he says: “It (the Ka`bah) was built the fourth time by Abraham and Ishmael, his son from Hagar.

      "question": "<p>My father works in a tourist restaurant where there is no alcohol, only food and drink. He gets a share of the daily profits and a monthly salary. <br />\n<br />\nThe tourists come in buses and do not pay the bill after eating; rather it is the tour company that pays the bills for the food. <br />\n<br />\nDuring the meal, the bus drivers wait outside. <br />\n<br />\nThe owner gives my father some money every day and says to him: Give tips to the bus drivers. The owner of the restaurant and the owner of the tour company know about these tips, in the sense that is something regular for the owner of the tour company to give the driver a salary and tell him that the restaurants will give him tips. <br />\nAnd the driver has nothing to do with the tourist groups; rather he is just a driver.<br />\n<br />\nMy father also accepts tips with the knowledge of the owner of the restaurant; in fact the owner encourages him to accept them. <br />\nWhat is the ruling on my father's wealth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      We have previously discussed the ruling on accepting tips       and “baksheesh” in the answer to question no.      <a href=\"/en/answers/82497\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">82497</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the tips in this case are given with the knowledge of     the tour company for whom the driver is working, there is nothing wrong with     that, because the restaurant can give some of the money to the company, so     if it agrees to give it to the worker, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The same may be said with regard to what your father     receives: if it is with the knowledge of the owner of the restaurant, there     is nothing wrong with it, because the customer has the right to pay more     than the agreed price, and if the owner of the restaurant agrees to leave     this additional money for the worker, there is nothing wrong with that. But     the worker or employee has to do his job properly and give the customer his     rights in full, whether he gives him a tip or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: I     work for a transportation company and I transport refrigerated fruit and     vegetables from Madeenah to Jeddah or Makkah or Riyadh.

Please note     that the owner of the company knows about that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    My question is: is this money or tip, as they call it, halaal     or haraam? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: We think that there is nothing wrong with you     taking the money that the owner of the grocery store gives to you when the     owner of the company is aware of that, and the aim behind that is to     encourage you to deliver the goods and take care of the vegetables before     they go rotten. As you deserve it because of your effort and you taking care     of the goods, and as it was given to you willingly by the owner, there is no     reason why you should not take it, even if it is in addition to the salary     for which you work. The aim behind it is to encourage you to carry on and to     do what is in their interests.

      "answer": "<p>    In His holy Book, Allah instructs us not     to enquire too deeply into matters that have nothing to do with our deeds     and which, if the truth became plain to a person, may cause him trouble.     Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Ask not about     things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask     about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to     you.

End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The commentators mentioned as the reason     for revelation of this verse a situation that is similar to your situation     that you are asking about. One of the Sahaabah was uncertain about his     attribution to his father, and he wanted to find out about that by asking     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). But when he asked     him, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) answered his     question, Qur’an was revealed criticising this behaviour on the part of that     questioner and rebuking him for enquiring into such matters. Al-Bukhaari     (7089) and Muslim (2359) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him)     said: (The people) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) until he was hard pressed by their questioning. He ascended the minbar     one day, and said: “You will not ask me anything but I will explain it to     you.” I started to look to my right and my left, and every man had wrapped     his head in his garment and was weeping. A man (‘Abdullah ibn Hudhaafah) who     used to be slandered and attributed to someone other than his father [i.e.,     if he had a dispute with anyone, his opponent would attribute him to someone     other than his father] stood up in the mosque and said: O Prophet of Allah,     who is my father? He said: “Your father is Hudhaafah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Qataadah used to quote this hadeeth in     reference to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who     believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you     trouble” [al-Maa’idah 5:101].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Az-Zuhri said: The mother of ‘Abdullah ibn     Hudhaafah (who was the mother of the Sahaabi who asked this question) said:     I have never seen a son more disrespectful than you. How can you be sure     that your mother did not commit some of the sins committed by the women of     the Jaahiliyyah, thus you would have exposed her before the people?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we advise you to do is to refrain     from mentioning this matter and from wondering and asking about it. Do not     ask your parents or anyone else about it. You are definitely to be     attributed to your father, because you were born to his wife and the     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: The     child is for the (owner of the) bed (i.e. the husband). Narrated by al-Bukhaari     (2053) and Muslim (1457).&nbsp; We ask Allah to guide you and help you to do all     that is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Questions regarding divorce in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation, divorce during menses, and denying paternity of the child",
      "question": "<p>There is a husband who does not fulfil his duties and responsibilities towards his wife; rather instead of doing so, he mistreats her verbally, mentally and physically, and instead of spending on her he takes her money and spends it on his own interests. After all this suffering she is compelled to ask him for a divorce, but he refuses, then when her family intervenes, he says that he will divorce her, but that is on condition that she lets him off paying the mahr, and her family agreed to that and wrote a document on her behalf in which they agreed that she will give up her right to the mahr if he divorces her. At the same time, he wrote a document in which he said, “In light of the request of wise people among the family, and because of the misunderstanding that occurred between me and her (i.e., his wife), I am divorcing her thrice, and there will never be any relationship between me and her in the future, and I do not have any child from her.” This is despite the fact that he had slept with her two days before that, and he knew that she was pregnant from him. Therefore the questions are:<br />\nIs this talaaq or khula‘?<br />\nIf it is khula‘, does it come under the same rulings as talaaq with regard to taking the wife back? In other words, is there any chance of taking her back?<br />\nIf it is a talaaq, is it irrevocable and is it the case that he cannot take her back except after she has been married to another man? Or is this threefold talaaq only counted as a single talaaq, and therefore does he have the right to take her back?<br />\nIf it is a talaaq, then what about the mahr that her family forced her to give up to him? Does he have to pay it despite what was written about giving it up? As far as we know, the husband is excused from paying the mahr if the wife is the one who is asking for separation for no good reason, but he forced her to do that with his bad behavior and bad treatment, so I think the ruling is different. Of course this applies if we regard this as a case of khula‘, but if it is a talaaq then it is more appropriate that he should pay, isn’t it? From what we know also, talaaq must take place during a period of complete purity (from menses) in which he has not had intercourse with her, and that he must wait for one month after that, and the same applies in every talaaq until the three talaaqs have been used up, then after that he should pay the mahr; but if he says the three talaaqs in one go, that only counts as one talaaq. But there are some scholars who say that it counts as a threefold talaaq, hence she is irrevocably divorced. What is the correct opinion on all these details? I hope that you can clarify, because we are people with little knowledge, and we cannot find anyone we can rely on with regard to these sensitive matters except you. As far as I know, Allah hates divorce, hence He has allowed man three opportunities in which to rethink the matter and take his wife back. Perhaps anger may overtake him in the first instance, in which case he can take her back. But some of the Sunni scholars here say that divorce is divorce, and that it takes place in all situations; so long as he has uttered it three times, then it counts as a threefold divorce, and they quote some hadeeths as evidence for that. We hope that you can advise us about this matter. Finally, in that document the husband wrote that he had no child from her, at the time when she was carrying in her womb a child from him, and she will give birth to this baby seven or eight months from now. What are the rulings connected to that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly this husband – if he really did that – is mistreating his wife, depriving her of her rights, and going against what Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined upon him of treating her in a good manner. He should have been kind to his wife and given her her rights in full, and if he disliked her, he should have parted with her in a good manner, in obedience to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner” [at-Talaaq 65:2]. This husband is not keeping her in a good manner, because he is mistreating his wife, transgressing against her and wasting her money. And he is not parting with her in a good manner, because what he should have done, if he wanted to separate from her, is to give his wife her rights in full with regard to the mahr. But he harmed her and put pressure on her, and he withheld her rights from her – without her deserving any such treatment – until she ransoms herself from him. Allah, may He be exalted, has forbidden such reprehensible conduct in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse. And live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisa’ 4:19].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This talaaq that has been given by this husband is called a “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation”; it is a kind of khula‘, as was explained in fatwa no. 198920&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fuqaha’ differed as to the definition of a khula‘ or “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation”. According to the majority of fuqaha’, it is an irrevocable talaaq. Al-Khurashi al-Maaliki said: An irrevocable talaaq can only come about using words that signal khula‘, “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation”, ransom or talaaq with monetary payment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel by al-Khurashi, 4/17&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the rulings on talaaq in return for payment is that the husband does not have the right to take the wife back during the ‘iddah. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (22/108), when mentioning the conditions on taking the wife back:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fifth condition: that the talaaq should not be in return for compensation. If the talaaq is in return for compensation, then it is not valid to take the wife back, because in that case the talaaq is irrevocable, because the woman has ransomed herself from the husband by means of the financial compensation that she gave him, which ended this relationship, as in the case of khula‘ and talaaq in return for money. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A number of scholars are of the view that khula‘ – along with “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation” – is an annulment of the marriage and not a talaaq. This is the more correct view, as we have explained in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/126444\">126444</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to this more correct view, what happened with this man is an annulment and is not a talaaq at all. Hence he has no right to take back the wife from whom he separated by khula‘ during the ‘iddah. If he wants to marry her again, then he may do so, with a new marriage contract and mahr, if she herself agrees to that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once it is proven that what happened comes under the heading of khula‘, then it does not matter whether it happened during menses or during a period of purity in which he had had intercourse with her, because the correct scholarly view is that there is nothing wrong with khula‘ during menses or during a period of purity in which intercourse took place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah (7/324): There is nothing wrong with khula‘ during menses or during a period of purity in which he had intercourse with her, because the prohibition on talaaq during menses is because of the harm that will affect her as a result of making the ‘iddah longer, whereas khula‘ is aimed at removing the harm that affects her because of the husband's bad treatment and staying with someone whom she dislikes, which is worse than the harm caused by extending the length of the ‘iddah. Hence it is permissible to ward off the greater harm by means of the lesser. For this reason the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask the woman who was separated by means of khula‘ about her condition. Moreover, the harm caused by extending the length of the ‘iddah affects her, whereas khula‘ occurs at her request, which signals that she approves of it and indicates that it is most likely in her best interests. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This issue has been discussed in detail in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/186809\">186809</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the mahr that was given up by the wife, she does not have the right to change her mind, because she gave it up by choice after the husband offered to give her a talaaq in return for giving up the mahr, and she agreed to that. She could have refused and referred the matter to the shar‘i judge (qaadi) to make him divorce her (talaaq) because of the harm she was suffering. In that case she could have gotten her rights in full.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the husband’s denial of this pregnancy and saying “I do not have a child from her,” this is reprehensible and is a false statement; there is a fear that he may come under the warning mentioned in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any man who denies his child whilst he is looking at him, will be obstructed from Allah, and Allah will disgrace him before all of creation, the first and the last of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2263; Ibn Maajah, 2743; classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah, 1427&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fuqaha’ (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that any child born to a woman six months or more after the marriage contract, when it is possible that intercourse may have taken place thereafter, is to be attributed to the husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle concerning that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The child is for the (owner of the) bed and the fornicator gets nothing.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “The child is for the (owner of the) bed”, what is meant is that if the man has a wife or a slave woman who has become his concubine, and she gives birth to a child within the timeframe during which it is feasible that it could be his child, the child is to be attributed to him and becomes his child; they may inherit from one another and all the other rulings stemming from birth are applicable to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 10/37&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what he has written, or even if she or her guardians wrote it, stating that he has no child from her, this is idle talk which is worthless and has no impact. If it so happened that he did not have a child from her at the time of writing, and her pregnancy was not known then, this does not mean that she did not bear him a child who was born after that, within the timeframe of feasibility, as mentioned above. It is not permissible for him to deny the child and it is not permissible either for her to conceal what Allah created in her womb from her husband, even if she hates him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>When having intercourse my desire is not fulfilled between me and my husband, and sometimes after intercourse is over I masturbate with my hand without my husband’s knowledge. This happens frequently. What is the Islamic ruling on that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Masturbation using the hand and otherwise is haram for both men and women, because of the evidence which you will find mentioned in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/329\" target=\"_blank\">329</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both spouses have the right to enjoy one another however they wish, so long as they avoid menstruation and the back passage. There is nothing wrong with him masturbating you by hand and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What you have mentioned about your desire not being fulfilled may be dealt with by speaking frankly with your husband and by each side being open and honest with the other, by each of them being aware of his or her responsibility and by both of them being eager to achieve happiness, tranquillity and love. Many husbands neglect the wife’s rights with regard to intimacy and fulfilment of desire, and this usually stems from ignorance about women’s nature and their differences from men with regard to this action. Speaking frankly, trying to deal with the matter and reading some books on this topic all play a major role in setting things straight, in sha Allah. If the woman has the habit of masturbating, that may make her lose interest in her husband and she may not feel any desire for intercourse, or it may not be enough to satisfy her. This is one of the harmful effects of masturbation that has been mentioned by specialists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please see also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/23390\" target=\"_blank\">23390</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My father divorced my mother irrevocably, and they cannot get back together. He subjected my mother to all kinds of injustice, humiliation, bad treatment and stinginess. He even betrayed her physically with more than one woman. <br />\n<br />\nThe point is that all of this mistreatment made my mother mentally ill and she could no longer bear to live with that. Now he has two houses, one in which my mother and her children live and the other in which he lives. The two houses are built of bricks and concrete without reinforcement, and the roofs are made of wood. The house in which we live with our mother was not built for us by him; rather it was built for us by some well-wishers five years after he left us and ran away, but he is threatening to sell it. Is it permissible for us, in order to protect our rights and our mother’s rights, to ask him to register this house in which we live, in return for our mother giving up to him things that she is entitled to, namely her mahr and the delayed portion of it, and the maintenance he is obliged to give her for the rest of her life, giving up all of that in return for him registering this house in which we live in our name?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is permissible for your father to put the house asked     about in your mother’s name and to make that a pure gift or to do it in     return for what she has of the mahr and the delayed portion, if applicable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    However some things must be borne in mind:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -1-</p>\n<p>    That your mother is no longer regarded as his wife, so if     your father has another wife, he is not obliged to treat them equally,     because she is no longer his wife. If he does not have another wife, then     there is nothing to prevent him from giving a house or anything else to his     ex-wife.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -2-</p>\n<p>    If he wants to put the house in your name, that is in the     name of his children, if he does not have any children from another wife,     then there is nothing wrong with him putting it in your name, because a man     may give his children whatever he wants. If he does have other children,     then he has to treat them fairly in terms of giving, so if he gives     something to one of them, he has to give the others something similar. See     the answer to questions no. <a href=\"/en/answers/22169\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">22169</a>     and <a href=\"/en/answers/89720\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">89720</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -3-</p>\n<p>    If your father does not own any part of the house, either the     land or the structure, and it was built for you by well-wishers, then it is     your property and your father has nothing to do with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the land belonged to your father, then the same applies as     stated above: it is permissible for him to register it in his ex-wife’s name     or in his children’s names, if he does not have other children, or if he has     other children and he treats all the children fairly in terms of giving.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We should point out that it is not permissible to accuse your     father of zina and that this is regarded as slander, so long as you have not     produced four witnesses to that, because Allah, may He be exalted, says     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four     witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony     forever, they indeed are the Fasiqoon (liars, rebellious, disobedient to     Allah).</p>\n<p>    Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous deeds,     (for such) verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</p>\n<p>    [an-Noor 24:4-5].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the father has the right to be treated with     kindness and respect, and to have ties upheld with him, even if he is an     evildoer or wrongdoer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah to set straight the affairs of all the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Some types of haraam transactions",
      "question": "<p>What are the types of haram transactions? Please quote the evidence for that.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There are many types of haram transactions, and it is not possible to list them all in this brief answer. On our website, in the section on haram transactions you will find many of these transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a useful principle concerning this matter, which will help one to understand the issue and by referring to it the issue will become clear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (29/22):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second principle concerning contracts, both halaal and haram: the basic principle in this regard is that Allah has forbidden us in His Book to eat up one another’s property unjustly (cf. 2:188); He condemned the rabbis and monks who ate up the people’s wealth unjustly; He condemned the Jews for consuming usury (riba) when they had been forbidden to do so, and for eating up the people’s wealth unjustly. This includes everything that is eaten up or consumed unjustly in transactions and donations, and whatever is taken without consent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eating up or consuming wealth unjustly in transactions is of two types, which Allah mentioned in His Book. They are usury (riba) and gambling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The prohibition on usury, which is the opposite of charity, is mentioned at the end of Soorat al-Baqarah, Soorat Aal ‘Imraan and ar-Room. The Jews are condemned for it in Soorat an-Nisa’, and the prohibition on gambling is mentioned in Soorat al-Maa’idah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained in detail that which Allah had mentioned in general terms in His Book. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade ambiguous transactions, as was narrated by Muslim and others from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). Ambiguous transactions are those of which the outcome is unknown, which leads to the same negative outcomes as gambling, namely enmity and resentment, in addition to consuming wealth unlawfully, which is a type of oppression or wrongdoing. Ambiguous transactions involve wrongdoing, enmity and resentment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for usury, the prohibition on it in the Qur’an is more emphatic. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers.</p>\n<p>And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger”&nbsp;[al-Baqarah 2:278-279].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) included it among the major sins, as was narrated in as-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). Allah stated that some good things that had been permitted to the Jews became forbidden to them because of their wrongdoing, their preventing people from following the path of Allah, and their consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. And He, may He be glorified and exalted, said that He will destroy riba (usury) as He gives increase for charity (cf. 2:276). Both matters are tried, tested and true in people’s experience. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the basic principle is that any transaction that includes either of these two forbidden matters – usury (riba) or gambling – or that is a trick to get around the prohibition on these two things, comes under the heading of haram transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of transactions that are haram because of usury (riba) include: ‘Eenah transaction [which means to sell something for a price to be paid at a later date, then to buy it back for a lower price to be paid immediately]; selling debts; combining a sale contract with a loan; and the like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of transactions that are haram because of gambling include: sales of unknown items; and sales of things that one cannot deliver.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/105339\">105339</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger.” [al-Tawbah 9:54]</p>\n<p>According to the hadith of Mu’adh, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent him to Yemen, he said: “You are going to people from among the people of the Book. Call them to bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers each day and night. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them charity (zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” (Agreed upon)</p>\n<p>So the disbeliever is commanded first of all to enter Islam. If he becomes Muslim, then we tell him to pray, give zakah, fast, perform Hajj and all the other duties of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Being_of_sound_mind_and_being_an_adultnbsp\"><b>Being of sound mind and being an adult&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pen is lifted from three [and does not record their deeds]: from one who is sleeping, until he wakes up; from a child until he reaches puberty, and from one who is insane until he comes to his senses.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4403; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So a child is not obliged to perform Hajj, but if his parents take him for Hajj, his Hajj is valid; the child will have the reward of Hajj and his parents will also have a reward. When a woman lifted up a child and asked, “Is there Hajj for this one?” the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, and you will have the reward.” (Narrated by Muslim)</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Being_freenbsp\"><b>Being free&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>Hajj is not obligatory for a slave, because he is distracted by his duties towards his master.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Being_able_to_do_itnbsp\"><b>Being able to do it&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Aal 'Imran 3:97]</p>\n<p>This includes being able both physically and financially.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by being physically able is that one is sound in body and can bear the hardship of travelling to the sacred House of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Meaning_of_financial_ability_in_Hajj\"><b>Meaning of financial ability in Hajj</b></span></h5>\n<p>Being financially able means that one has enough funds to get to the sacred House of Allah and back again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee said (11/30):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Being able to do Hajj means that one is sound in body and has means of transportation to reach the sacred House of Allah whether by plane, car or riding animal, or by renting such means, according to his situation, and that he has sufficient provisions to get there and back. That should be surplus to what he needs to spend on those on whom he is obliged to spend, until he returns from Hajj. A woman should also have a husband or mahram with whom to travel to Hajj or ‘Umrah.”</p>\n<p>The money that he uses to reach the sacred House should be surplus to his basic needs, the spending enjoined on him by Shari’ah, and what he needs to pay off his debts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by debts here is things that he owes to Allah, such as expiations, and what he owes to other people.</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Hajj_of_one_who_is_in_debt\"><b>Hajj of one who is in debt</b></span></h5>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36852\" target=\"_blank\">If a person has a debt</a> , and he does not have enough money to both do Hajj and pay off the debt, then he should pay off the debt first and he does not have to go for Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some people think that the reason is that he did not ask permission from the one to whom he owes the money, and that if he gives him permission, then there is nothing wrong with it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no basis for this thinking, rather the reason is being in debt. It is known that if the lender gives the debtor permission to go for Hajj, that does not mean the debt is waived, and he will not have discharged his duty because of this permission. Hence it should be said to the debtor: Pay off your debt first, then if you have enough left, go for Hajj; otherwise Hajj is not obligatory in your case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the debtor who did not go for Hajj because of his debt dies, then he will meet Allah with his Islam complete and not lacking, because Hajj was not obligatory for him, just as zakah and also Hajj are not obligatory for one who is poor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he does Hajj before paying off his debt and then dies before paying it off, then he is in danger, because even the martyr is forgiven for everything except debt, so what about anyone else?&nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Meaning_of_spending_enjoined_by_Sharirsquoah\"><b>Meaning of spending enjoined by Shari’ah</b></span></h5>\n<p>What is meant by the spending enjoined on him by Shari’ah is what he is obliged by shari’ah to spend on himself and his family, without being either extravagant or stingy. If he is of average means and wants to show signs of richness such as buying an expensive car so that he will look rich, and he does not have enough money to perform Hajj, then he has to sell the car and use that money to perform Hajj, and he should buy a car that suits his situation. His spending on this car is not a kind of spending that is approved of in shari’ah, rather it is extravagance, which is forbidden in Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by financially able is that he should have enough for his family until he returns, and he should have an income after he returns to take care of himself and those on whom he spends, such as rent from property, a salary and business earnings, etc. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence he does not have to use the capital of his business, the profit of which he spends on himself and his family, to do Hajj, if that loss of capital will result in a loss of profits which in turn will mean that his family does not have enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee (11/36) was asked about a man who has a sum of money in an Islamic bank and his income came from the profits on that money which gave him enough to live a moderate lifestyle. Is he obliged to do Hajj using that capital, knowing that this would affect his monthly income and stretch his finances unbearably?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If your situation is as you describe, you are not obliged to perform Hajj because you are not able to in the manner required by shari’ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Al 'Imran 3:97]</p>\n<p>And He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [al-Hajj 22:78]” &nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Meaning_of_basic_needs\"><b>Meaning of basic needs</b></span></h5>\n<p>What is meant by basic needs is what a person needs a great deal of in his life, and which it is too hard for him to do without, such as books for the seeker of knowledge. So we do not tell him: Sell your books and use the money to go for Hajj, because these are basic needs for him. Similarly if a person needs his car, we do not tell him, Sell it and use the money to go to Hajj. But if he has two cars and he does not need one of them, then he has to sell one of them and use the money to go to Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly, a craftsman does not need to sell his tools, because he needs them. And if a man has a car which he uses for work and spends on himself and his family from the money he earns for hiring it out, he does not have to sell it in order to go for Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another basic need is the need to get married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person needs to get married, that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27120\" target=\"_blank\">takes precedence over Hajj</a> , otherwise Hajj takes precedence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by being financially able is that a person should have surplus funds that are sufficient for doing Hajj after paying off debts and taking care of shar’i obligations and basic needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person is physically and financially able to do Hajj, then he is obliged to hasten to do Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is not physically and financially able, or if he is physically able but he is poor and has no wealth, then he is not obliged to do Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person is financially able but he is not physically able, then we look at the matter further.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If his problem is something that he hopes will disappear, such as a sickness from which he hopes to recover, then he should wait until Allah heals him, then do Hajj.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If his problem is one for which there is no hope that it will disappear, such as a person with cancer or an old person who cannot do Hajj, then he has to appoint someone to do Hajj on his behalf, and the duty to perform Hajj is not waived because of his physical inability if he is financially able. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1513) according to which a woman said: “O Messenger of Allah, Allah’s command to the people to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He said: “Yes.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed with her comment that Hajj was obligatory for her father even though he was physically unable to perform Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Can_women_go_to_Hajj_without_a_mahram\"><b>Can women go to Hajj without a mahram?</b></span></h4>\n<p>In order for Hajj to be obligatory for a woman, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/34380\" target=\"_blank\">it is essential for her to have a mahram with her</a> , and it is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj, whether that is an obligatory or nafl Hajj, without a mahram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a mahram.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1862; Muslim 1341)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mahram is her husband or one whom it is permanently forbidden for her to marry because of blood ties, breastfeeding or ties through marriage. The husband of a sister, maternal aunt or paternal aunt is not a mahram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some women take this matter lightly and travel with their sister and sister’s husband, or with a maternal aunt and the aunt’s husband, but this is haram, because the sister’s husband or the maternal aunt’s husband is not a mahram, so it is not permissible for her to travel with him. So there is the fear that her Hajj is not proper, for the proper Hajj (Hajj mabrur) is that which is not mixed with any sin, but this woman is sinning throughout her journey until she returns home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also essential that the mahram be an adult of sound mind, because the aim of the mahram is to protect the woman, and a child or one who is insane cannot do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman does not have a mahram, or she has one but he is unable to travel with her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Should_the_wife_ask_for_her_husbandrsquos_permission_to_go_to_Hajjnbsp\"><b>Should the wife ask for her husband’s permission to go to Hajj?&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/40525\">husband’s permission is not an essential condition</a> of it being obligatory for a woman to do Hajj, rather she is obliged to do Hajj when the conditions of it being obligatory are met, even if her husband does not give permission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee said (11/20):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The obligatory Hajj is obligatory when the conditions of being able to do it are met, and the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36595\" target=\"_blank\">husband’s permission</a> is not one of them. It is not permissible for him to forbid her, rather it is prescribed for him to cooperate with her in fulfilling this duty. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This has to do with the obligatory Hajj. As for nafl Hajj, Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that the scholars were unanimously agreed that a husband has the right to forbid his wife from doing a nafl Hajj, because the husband’s rights are binding upon her and are not superseded by something that is not obligatory for her.

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on exercising in a gym where there is music? Please note that I have advised those who are in charge but they did not act upon my advice. Now I have started to use an mp3 player whilst I am exercising.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to listen to music, whether in a gym or     elsewhere, because of a great deal of evidence which states that it is     haraam to listen to musical instruments. See the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/5000\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">5000</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fact that there is music in the gym is an evil which must     be denounced. It is not sufficient just to put on earphones to block the     sound or distract oneself by listening to something permissible. Rather if     denouncing it verbally does not work, there remains the option of denouncing     it in one’s heart, which can only be achieved by going away from the evil     and leaving the place where it is happening, so long as one is able to do     that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let him change it with     his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking     out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart – and that is the weakest of     faith.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Muslim (49).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fact that it is obligatory to leave the place where evil     is being committed is also indicated by the verse in which Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And it has     already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear     the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them,     until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them)     certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect     the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’     4:140]</p>\n<p>al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have     mercy on him) said: The words of Allaah, “then sit not with them, until     they engage in a talk other than that” mean, something other than kufr     (disbelief). “(But if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you     would be like them” – this indicates that it is obligatory to avoid     people of sin if they are openly committing evil, because the one who does     not avoid them is approving of their deeds, and approving of kufr is also     kufr. Allaah says “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case     you would be like them”, so everyone who sits in a gathering where sin     is committed and does not denounce them will share the burden of sin with     them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>They should be denounced if     they speak of sin or commit sin; if one cannot denounce them then he should     leave them so that he will not be one of those mentioned in this verse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Umar     ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez caught some people who were drinking alcohol, and it was     said to him that one of the people present was fasting. He had the     punishment carried out on him too, and he recited this verse: “(but if     you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them”,     i.e., approval of sin is also a sin. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Jassaas said in     Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (2/407): This verse indicates that it is obligatory to     denounce evil to the one who does it, and part of denouncing it is showing     one’s dislike of it if it is not possible to remove it, and not sitting with     the one who does it, and leaving him until he stops it and does something     else. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah     have mercy on him) said: Denouncing in one's heart is obligatory for     everyone, which means hating the evil and leaving the people if one is     unable to change it with one's words or actions, because Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And when you (Muhammad    صلى الله عليه وسلم) see those who engage     in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’aan) by mocking at     them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaytaan     (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the     company of those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)”</p>\n<p>[al-An’aam 6:68]</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Durar     al-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajwabah al-Najdiyyah (16/142).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    To sum up, you must denounce this evil and advise those who     are in charge of this gym. If they respond, then praise be to Allaah, and if     they do not respond then look for another gym, and do not share in the sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to refuse a suitor because he does not own an apartment?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to refuse someone who comes to propose marriage because he does not own an apartment? Is it permissible to refuse to read al-Faatihah for the same reason, that he does not have an apartment? Please note that the girl agrees to this young man and his family are moderately well off. Is the girl’s speaking to the young man behind her family’s backs halaal or haram?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the one who is proposing marriage is acceptable in terms of religious commitment and good character, and he is able to provide accommodation, even if that will be after some time, then he should not be refused, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him, for if you do not do so, there will be tribulation and great mischief on earth.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1084) from Abu Hurayrah; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he is not able to provide accommodation, or he needs a lot of time until he can afford it, then there is nothing wrong with refusing him, because of the harm that will be caused to the girl by tying her to him and waiting a long time to get married. When Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan proposed to Faatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with them both), Mu’aawiyah was poor, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised her to refuse his offer, because he was poor and had no wealth. Narrated by Muslim (1480).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This suitor who is unable to afford the expenses of marriage is addressed by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty” [al-Noor 24:33] and&nbsp; by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5065)and Muslim (1400).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not prescribed to recite al-Faatihah at the time of engagement, because that is not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mahr and accommodation are the rights of the wife, and she may be content with a little of that. Her guardian should help her to be chaste. If she accepts someone whose religious commitment and character are pleasing, and he has enough to provide accommodation and the mahr, then it is not permissible to prevent the girl from marrying. But if he does not have anything, then the guardian may refuse the proposal, because the girl’s agreement in this case is based on emotion and lack of experience, and perhaps she is deceived by the suitor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for a girl to form a relationship with a non-mahram man, whether he has proposed marriage to her or not, because of the bad consequences to which that may lead, as is obvious, especially if her family have refused his proposal; in that case there is no justifiable reason for him to speak to her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45668\">45668</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36807\">36807</a> on the ruling on speaking and correspondence between a suitor and his fiancée.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>There are many ways of creating interest in Islam, such as reading the seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or reading about the miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or about his prevailing victories and the defeat of his enemies. One may also look at the beauties of Islam, or explain that the sharee’ah of Islam includes everything that is good, and that sharee’ah does not enjoin anything except that which is in accordance with reason and common sense, and it does not forbid anything without explaining what is wrong with it and putting people off it. For this reason people, Arabs and others, entered Islam voluntarily, without being forced. We advise this woman to put an end to her relationship with this Christian man which has lasted for so long and he is still persisting in his kufr. If he chooses Islam of his own free will, then he must be tested after that to be certain that he is sincere. He must also be told that if he goes back to Christianity after becoming Muslim, he is to be killed. (Because the punishment for apostasy in Islam is death. Whoever recognizes the true religion and enters it then leaves it, does not deserve to live. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.” This is what is to be applied if he is living in a country which is ruled by sharee’ah. The point is that this person should be informed of the seriousness of the matter. And Allaah is the source of strength.)&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on mixed da‘wah groups on Facebook and WhatsApp? If they are not permissible, then is the ruling different if the women merely follow the group without participating in it?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Islamic teachings aim to close the door to evil and temptation in order to protect people’s religious commitment and piety, and to keep their hearts free of the traces of desires and sin.</p>\n<p>Direct conversations and correspondence between specific men and women on the Internet – whether by speaking or writing – are among the doors that lead to temptation and evil, because of what results from these conversations of getting carried away in talking, which usually leads to admiration and infatuation.</p>\n<p>How often have such conversations brought about evil and calamity for those who participate in them, until they ended up falling in love and becoming infatuated, and – in some cases – has led to what is even worse than that, for the Shaytaan makes each party imagine about the other things that lead to infatuation which brings about negative consequences in both worldly and spiritual terms.</p>\n<p>Islamic teachings close the doors that lead to temptation. Islam forbids women to speak softly, and it forbids a man to shake hands with a non-mahram woman or look at her, or to be alone with her. Islam explains that these matters are among the causes that lead to temptation. This is something that is proven by experience and well-known.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Dhamm al-Hawa (p. 582):</p>\n<p>Among the reprehensible carelessness that leads to the most serious trouble for individuals is speaking to non-mahram women and being alone with them. That was customary among some of the Arab tribes, who thought that that was not shameful, and they were confident that they would refrain from zina, so they were content to look at and speak to [those women]. But these things had an impact on the heart and soul without them realizing, until that led them to trouble and doom. This careless attitude caused many problems for “Majnoon Layla” [a figure in ancient Arabic literature who went mad because of his unrequited love for a woman called Layla] and others like him, and led them to insanity and doom.</p>\n<p>They erred on two counts:</p>\n<p>1. They went against Islamic teachings which forbade looking at non-mahram women and being alone with them.</p>\n<p>2. They exposed themselves to that to which they were naturally inclined, then they suffered in their attempts to restrain themselves, because human nature will usually have its way; so if a person’s natural inclination is strong and he cannot resist it, he will end up falling into sin. But if he resists his natural inclination, then that will lead to his ruin, like preventing a thirsty person from drinking water. End quote.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/277583\">277583</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/34841\">34841</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that a woman should keep away from chat rooms and other groups on social media and apps, and she should avoid wasting her time and protect her dignity.</p>\n<p>But if there is some benefit to be gained from a study group or a da‘wah group, and she thinks that there is something in it from what she may benefit, then there is nothing wrong with her taking part in these beneficial study groups or da‘wah groups, whilst ensuring that she adheres strictly to proper etiquette and remains completely serious, and shuts the door to any kind of temptation for herself or others. She should pay attention to the following things:</p>\n<p>1. She should not post anything that may provoke desire in these groups; rather she should only post that which is useful and beneficial.</p>\n<p>2. Comments should only be as much as is needed or is beneficial, and participants should avoid making any comment that could provoke desire or attract the attention of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p>3. The women’s participation should only be as much as is needed. So she should post her question or topic, then leave and not comment except when absolutely necessary, because the basic principle is that she should refrain from speaking to men or mixing with them.</p>\n<p>4. There should be nothing in her words that could provoke desire, such as joking or speaking softly, or laughing (such as writing “hahahaha”), or using smiling emojis, because that may lead to coveting on the part of one in whose heart is disease, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women. If you fear Allah , then do not be soft in speech [to men], lest he in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with appropriate speech”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:32].</p>\n<p>5. She should avoid giving out her email address, or corresponding privately with any man, even if that is for the purpose of seeking help, because of what such correspondence usually leads to of infatuation and temptation.</p>\n<p>6. If a woman joins the group in order to follow only, in order to benefit without participating or commenting, there is nothing wrong with that, and it is safer for her.</p>\n<p>7. Over and above all of that, each individual is responsible for his own self. So each person should check his own self and his actions, and he should check his heart and be aware of what influences him. If he notices any trace of temptation, evil or corruption, he should hasten to leave and close the door to corruption, for there is nothing of greater worth than being safe.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82196\">82196</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

As for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/153665\" target=\"_blank\">joining prayers</a> , it is proven that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined prayers when travelling, and it is also proven that he did not join prayers, which indicates that joining prayers is not a recommended Sunnah for all travellers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, the traveller does not have the choice between shortening or not shortening his prayers; rather it is confirmed that he should shorten his prayers, unless he is praying behind an Imam who is offering the prayer in full, in which case he should offer the prayer in full behind him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for joining prayers, the traveller has the choice: he may join them or not join them, or he may join them sometimes and not at other times. It is permissible but is not recommended, but joining prayers is recommended for the traveller if he needs to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>There is some pus that comes out of my penis from time to time, because of a bladder infection. Does this invalidate the fast, prayer and wudoo’?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>With regard to the fast, that does not invalidate it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to purification and prayer:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This pus that comes out of the urethra is najis (impure). If it comes out occasionally, but usually it does not come out, then it is obligatory to purify oneself of it every time it comes out, and to wash off whatever of it has gotten onto the body or clothes. It invalidates wudoo, and if comes out during the prayer, it renders it invalid. So in that case he should stop praying, go and purify himself and do wudoo’,&nbsp; and start the prayer all over again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if it comes out all the time, then it comes under the same ruling as urinary incontinence. In this case, he should clean himself (instinja’), purify anything it got onto, wrap something over it so that it will not get onto his garment and the impurity will not spread further, then he should do wudoo’ at the time of each prayer, and it will not matter if it comes out after that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who had a constant discharge of pus from his penis: is his prayer valid when this is coming out?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to give up praying; rather he should pray according to what he is able to do. If the impurity does not stop long enough for him to do wudoo’ and pray, then he should pray according to his situation, after doing wudoo’, even if the impurity comes out whilst he is praying. But he should put something over it so as to prevent the impurity spreading further.

      "question": "<p>I am struggling to gain khushoo in salah as I am a mother of two children. One daughter is 3 the other 8 months. I always have that worry in the back of my head the children will hurt themselves on furniture , or the kitchen as it is joint to the lounge with no doors! I want to connect with Allah but feel the shaytan is playing games with my head! My motherly instincts tell me to check they are ok!</p>\n<p>Also is the salah Invalid if I turn to glimpse that my baby is ok؟</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>You should not pay any attention to the whispers of the Shaytaan with which he tries to distract people from their prayers and from focusing properly in the prayer (khushoo‘).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Before starting to pray, the Muslim should deal with anything that may distract him from his prayer. If you can pray at a time when the children are sleeping, that is better, and you should hasten to pray before they wake up.</p>\n<p>If it is possible for you to leave your daughters with someone who will watch them so that you can focus on your prayer and not be distracted by anything else, then do so.</p>\n<p>If you can distract the children with some toys or cartoons, then do that. If it is not possible for you to do that, then keep them with you in the room and close the door. By doing that, there will be no need to worry about them, and you will be able to deal with a lot of this waswaas yourself.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with you looking around whilst praying in order to check on them if need be, if there is something that really necessitates looking around. There are some hadeeths which indicate that there is nothing wrong with looking around whilst praying if there is a need to do so, as has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/160647\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">160647</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/5485\">5485</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Among us non-Arabs there are many who may<br />\n      pray one time, then not pray another time, until they reach the age of thirty or<br />\n      thereabouts, then after the age of thirty or forty, they start to pray regularly.

      "answer": "<p>The person who is in this situation is a kaafir guilty of kufr akbar    (i.e., he is beyond the pale of Islam), according to the more correct of the two scholarly    opinions, so long as he does not deny that the prayer is obligatory.

If he repents and starts    to pray the obligatory prayers and to fast in Ramadaan, and he continues to do so, then he    is considered to be a Muslim, and the prayers and fasts that he deliberately failed to do    in the past do not have to be made up, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah    be upon him) said: “Islam wipes out what came before and repentance wipes out what    came before”, and because the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), when they    fought the apostates at the time of [Abu Bakr] al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with    him), they did not tell those who came back to Islam to make up the fasts or prayers, and    they [the Sahaabah] are the most knowledgeable of the sharee’ah of Allaah after the    Messengers, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them.</p>\n",

      "title": "If he did ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, intending to do Hajj in the same year, is he doing tamattu‘ even if he intended to do ifraad?",
      "question": "<p>I am from Riyadh, and my mother and father were staying with me for a two-month visit in Riyadh, and we intended to do Hajj this year. We went to Makkah on the first day of Dhu’l-Qa‘dah to do ‘umrah, and we are going to stay in Makkah until Hajj, in sha Allah. We entered ihram for ‘umrah from the miqaat of as-Sayl, and I asked them not to say that it was ‘umrah as part of Hajj tamattu‘, because I cannot afford to pay the price for the hadiy (sacrificial animal), and we are going to do Hajj ifraad. Now they are in Makkah. What is the solution? Can they enter ihram for Hajj ifraad from Makkah on the day of at-Tarwiyah (the eighth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah), or do they have to complete it as Hajj tamattu‘? Or do they have to offer a hadiy? Please note that they are not able to go back to the miqaat.<br />\nThe second question is: I am going to go and join them in Makkah one week before Hajj. Do I have to do Hajj tamattu‘, or can I intend to do Hajj ifraad?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Whoever comes to Makkah for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj and intends to stay there until the time of Hajj is doing Hajj tamattu‘ and therefore must offer a sacrifice.</p>\n<p>The intention (niyyah) for tamattu‘, as explained by the scholars, is when a person does ‘umrah during the months of Hajj and – at the time of doing ‘umrah – also intends to do Hajj in the same year. Whoever does that is doing tamattu‘.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If you enter ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, having intended to also perform Hajj in the same year, then you are doing tamattu‘, so long as you do not go back to your own city. But if you go back to your city, then come back from your city and enter ihram for Hajj on its own, then you are not doing tamattu‘, so you do not have to offer a hadiy.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa al-‘Uthaymeen (24/191)</p>\n<p>He also said:</p>\n<p>So long as you came from your country, intending to do Hajj, and you entered ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, then you are doing tamattu‘ regardless of whether or not you intended to do tamattu‘, because what you have done is tamattu‘.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa al-‘Uthaymeen.</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>I came in Ramadan to perform ‘umrah and I intended to remain there until Hajj. On the fourth day of Shawwaal I did ‘umrah on behalf of my deceased sister. Please note that I was not aware that the one who does ‘umrah during the months of Hajj is regarded as doing tamattu‘. Do I have to offer a hadiy now, because I am doing tamattu‘?</p>\n<p>The shaykh replied: The one who does tamattu‘ is the one who enters ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, after the month of Shawwaal begins, with the intention of doing Hajj in the same year, then he does Hajj. The one who is doing tamattu‘ must offer whatever hadiy he can afford, such as a sheep, a goat or a lamb that is older than six months and is free of any defects that would prevent it from being acceptable as a sacrifice. If you are not able to do that, then you must fast for three days during Hajj and seven days after you return home, making a total of ten. The three days during hajj begin from the time the pilgrim enters ihram for ‘umrah. In other words, for example, a person may do tamattu‘ now, when he has no money. In this case we say: Fast from now; fast three days during Hajj and seven days when he goes back to his family and his journey is over. And if he says: I cannot fast on consecutive days, we say: Let him fast for one day and not fast for one or two days. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “then a fast of three days during hajj” [al-Baqarah 2:196]; He did not stipulate that they be consecutive. If Allah had wanted us to fast these days consecutively, He would have stated that. And if a person says: I cannot fast, because I have diabetes and I need water, and I cannot fast for three days or even for one day, then in that case he does not have to do anything, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity” [al-Baqarah 2:286].</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa al-‘Uthaymeen (22/42).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen also said:</p>\n<p>Should he say, “Labbayk ‘umaratan mutamatti‘an biha ila al-hajj [Here I am for ‘umrah, joining it to Hajj (tamattu‘)]”?</p>\n<p>The answer is: No, there is no need for him to say this, because simply intending to do Hajj in the same year is in effect tamattu‘. Tamattu‘ means entering ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, and finishing it [and exiting ihram], then entering ihram [again] for Hajj in the same year. There is no need to say “joining it to Hajj”. Rather the pilgrim should simply say “Labbayka ‘umratan [Here I am for ‘umrah], and if he has the intention of doing Hajj, this is tamattu‘.</p>\n<p>End quote from Jalasaat al-Hajj.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on playing with ouija boards",
      "question": "<p>I recently found out about a game that is very common in our country, which is called Ouija. Does this game come under the heading of witchcraft and interacting with the jinn?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The ouija board game poses a danger to the religious commitment and life of the player. With regard to his religious commitment, that is because it involves calling upon and addressing the jinn, responding to them, believing their words, and being afraid of going against their orders. The ruling on playing this game is no different than the ruling on going to fortune tellers and soothsayers, because of what happens of the player asking the jinn about matters that are unseen or unknown to him. With regard to the danger that it poses to his life, that is because of what has happened of many people being affected by mental illness, anxiety and fear that ruined their lives. Hence there have been many statements from psychologists and there is unanimous agreement on the necessity of getting rid of this game and not trying it out, let alone playing it and becoming attached to it.</p>\n<p>In brief, it consists of a board on which are written all the numbers and letters, and at the top of the board are written the words Yes, No, and Goodbye. Each board is written in the language of the local people and there is a disc in the middle of the board, the edges of which are held by a minimum of two players. The game begins by calling upon “Ouija”, and it is clear in the minds of the players that they are now calling upon a spirit or a jinn, according to the player’s belief, and he is asked about things that are unknown to them of events that have taken place, and the disc moves towards the numbers and letters in order to spell out the answer to the question. If the question is about a specific date, the disc, with their fingers on it, moves towards the numbers in order to answer the question. Similarly, if the question is about a name or an event, then the disc moves towards the letters in order to spell out the answer to the question. Or the answer may be Yes or No, so the disc moves towards one of them. The players cannot choose to exit the game until they ask permission from “Ouija”, then if the disk moves towards the word No, they cannot leave the game, but if it moves towards the word Yes, then they can leave, whereupon they have to thank him, then when the players have thanked him, the disc moves towards the word Goodbye.</p>\n<p>Some people try to take the matter lightly and make it merely a game for fun, but in fact it is extremely serious. What appears to be the case is that the word “Ouija” is the name of one of the jinn – a king or someone else– and he sends one of his troops to move the disk towards the numbers and letters to spell out the answers. There are some people who believe that this movement comes from the devil-companions (qareen) of the players, and that what they ask about is known to them only or is known in the realm of the jinn. There are others – Western doctors and scientists – who believe that the phenomenon of the disk’s movement is what is called “unconscious movement”; what is meant is that the mind is able, under the influence of certain emotions, to move the muscles of the body unconsciously, without the individual being aware of this movement, so it appears to him as if the spirits are moving the pointer under his hand.</p>\n<p>What is established in the mind of the Muslim is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade going to soothsayers and said that “they are nothing.” And he said that if a person goes to them, even if he does not believe in them, then no prayer will be accepted from him for forty days, and that whoever goes to them and believes in them has committed an act of disbelief.</p>\n<p>We have discussed all of this – with the relevant evidence – in the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8291\">8291</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60431\">60431</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for the Muslim to seek the help of the jinn to find out unknown and unseen matters, even if he does not seek to draw close to them by doing acts of worship or obedience to them. Merely seeking their help is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Because the jinn benefit from the humans who play this game, the jinn submit, in a sense, to the players, by telling them the unknown matters they ask about. The human also submits to the jinn in a sense. It is sufficient to note that they dare not leave the game without seeking the permission of “Ouija”, otherwise they think and believe that they will be harmed. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinns! Many did you mislead of men,’ and their Auliya (friends and helpers, etc.) amongst men will say: ‘Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us’” [al-An‘aam 6:128]. The sin and disbelief that affect the player before and during the game, and afterwards, is what Allah, may He be exalted, mentions in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the jinns, but they (jinns) increased them (mankind) in sin and disbelief” [al-Jinn 72:6].</p>\n<p>With regard to the ruling on seeking the help of the jinn, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11114\">11114</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/78546\">78546</a>.</p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>It is haraam for the Muslim to play the Ouija board game, even if in fact it involves no more than unconscious movements, because the player actually and intentionally calls upon the jinn, which comes under the heading of seeking the help of the jinn and the ruling on going to fortune tellers and soothsayers. All of these are haraam things. We have discussed this above and in the answers referred to.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Woman working in a home for the elderly",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for a women to work in a home for the elderly that is mixed, men and women together, where the workers have to wash the people, both men and women, and change their diapers, or she may have to give them forbidden drinks and meals containing pork? Can a Muslim woman work in this place if she avoids giving the people alcohol and haram meats? Also please note that she is not allowed to wear anything but a scarf on her head and a knee-length shirt over trousers, on grounds of necessity. Some people have told the women that doing this kind of work is better than being dependent on the social agencies that offer help to families whose head is out of work.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>With regard to offering alcohol and pork to the residents of the home for the elderly, this is undoubtedly haram, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to alcohol, including the one who carries it and the one who pours it. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to wine: the one who presses (the grapes), the one for whom it is pressed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it and consumes its price, the one who buys it and the one for whom it is bought.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1295; Abu Dawood, 3674). So it is not permissible to carry it or serve it and to be paid for that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah forbids people to eat something, He also forbids its price to them [i.e., they are not allowed to sell it].” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani – may Allah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 2978).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also well known that alcohol and pork are forbidden in the Qur’aan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There remain two further issues of concern:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first is that the Muslim woman who works in this home is not wearing complete shar’i hijaab.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second is that washing the elderly people and changing their diapers will lead to seeing and touching their ‘awrahs. This is permissible in cases of necessity, but I do not think they will appoint men to take care of men and women to take care of women; usually they bring all the people together in one place and both women and men work with both sexes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So my advice is that a Muslim woman, in particular, should not work in this place. This work is also not desirable because it involves dealing with impure things. Accepting help from the social institution, even though it involves the humiliation of the Muslim taking aid from the kaafirs, is still easier to bear that this work which involves going against sharee’ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to cause Islam and the Muslims to prevail. And Allah is the Source of help.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for the husband’s brother to take his brother’s wife to the doctor, if his brother is not there, or if he cannot be there, and the hospital is in the same city?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is not permissible for the wife to travel in a car alone     with her husband’s brother, because that comes under the heading of khulwah     (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) which the Messenger      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against when he said:     “Beware of entering upon women.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what     about the in-law?” He said: “The in-law is death.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari     and Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What do you understand from these words? Is it forbidden or     allowed? Undoubtedly what is meant is that it is forbidden and not allowed.     So it is not permissible for a man to be alone with his brother’s wife,     either in a car or in the house. Worse than that is what some people do when     a guest comes when the man is at work, and there is no one in the house     except his wife, then she opens the door to him and he goes in and waits for     the owner of the house to come home. The point is that it is not permissible     for any woman to be alone with any man (i.e., non mahrams) even if he is one     of her husband’s relatives or one of her relatives or neighbours, unless she     has a mahram with her, whether that is in her home town or when travelling.     It should also be noted that it is haraam for her to travel even if there is     no khulwah, if she does not have a mahram with her, because of the hadeeth     of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) which is narrated in     al-Saheehayn. He said: I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) delivered a khutbah and said: “No man should be alone     with a woman unless there is a mahram with her, and no woman should travel     without a mahram.”&nbsp;</p>\n",

For example, I would recite the first verse of Surah Fatiha, then after this I would say: \"All praise is due to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the Worlds.\" Is this right, or permissible?.</p>\n",

This comes under       the heading of pondering and thinking of the meaning. That is on condition       that you do not utter it out loud, because the one who is praying is       forbidden to speak during the prayer, based on the report narrated by       Muslim (537) from Mu‘aawiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Sulmi who said: Whilst I was       praying with the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon       him), a man among the people sneezed and I said: Yarhamuk Allaah       (may Allah have mercy on you). The people glared at me and I said: May my       mother be bereft of me! Why are you staring at me? They started striking       their hands on their thighs, and when I realized that they were telling me       to be quiet, (I felt angry) but I kept quiet. When the Messenger of Allaah       (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had prayed – may my father and       mother be sacrificed for him; by Allaah I have never seen a better teacher       or better teachings before or since; he did not rebuke me, hit me or       revile me – he said: “This prayer is not the right place for any of the       people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, takbeer and recitation of Qur’aan,”       or words to that effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And because it is not permissible to recite Qur’aan in any     language other than Arabic.

      "title": "Is Al-Fatihah Part of the Funeral Prayer?",
      "question": "<p>What is the status/class of Hadith: Nafi` reported that Abdullah Ibn Umar did not use to recite (Fatihah) over the dead person. (Muwatta Imam Malik)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This report is of the highest degree of soundness. Imam Malik narrated it in Al-Muwatta’ (535) from Nafi` from Ibn `Umar, and this is what some of the scholars called As-silsilah Al-dhahabiyyah (the golden chain), which is the soundest, or one of the soundest, of Isnads (chains of narration).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wording is: It was narrated from Nafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) that `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did not <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9304\" target=\"_blank\">recite in the funeral prayer</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The meaning of the phrase “did not recite” is that he did not recite the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/132386\" target=\"_blank\">Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah)</a> or anything else. This is one of the well-known topics of dispute among the scholars. Some of them are of the view that it is a pillar or essential part of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/35853\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> , and others are of the view that it is not a pillar or even recommended. Others adopt a middle view and say that it is recommended but not obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) who said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The scholars differed concerning recitation of the Quran in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/90030\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> . There are three views.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was said that it is not recommended under any circumstances, as is the view of Abu Hanifah and Malik.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And it was that it is obligatory to recite <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147645\" target=\"_blank\">Al-Fatihah</a> , as is the view of some of the companions of Al-Shafi`i and Ahmad.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And it was said that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/315345\" target=\"_blank\">reciting Al-Fatihah</a> in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/162515\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> is Sunnah, but not reciting it and saying Du`a’ without reciting is permissible. This is the correct view.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 2/121)&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It seems – and true knowledge belongs to Allah – that reciting Al-Fatihah is a pillar or essential part of the funeral prayer. This comes under the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no prayer for the one <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10995\" target=\"_blank\">who does not recite the Opening of the Book</a> .” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 714; Muslim, 595). Perhaps because Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) held this view, Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) used to recite it out loud sometimes, although the Sunnah is to recite it quietly, in order to demonstrate that it should be recited in the funeral prayer. He was asked about that and he said: “So that you will know that it is Sunnah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1249)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>His saying that it is Sunnah does not mean that it is recommended, rather what he means is that it was the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/231217\" target=\"_blank\">Al-Fatihah</a> is a pillar or essential part of the funeral prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book,” and the funeral prayer is a prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies” [At-Tawbah 9:84].&nbsp; So Allah calls it a prayer. And Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) recited Al-Fatihah in the funeral prayer, and said: “So that you will know that it is Sunnah.”&nbsp;(Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 5/401)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on reciting Al-Fatihah in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12363\" target=\"_blank\">funeral prayer</a> ? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is obligatory, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp; “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Majmu` Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 13/143)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Our religion says that if the husband calls his wife for intercourse, she must respond to his request. What if he calls her to play with him; does the wife also have to obey him in that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the husband calls his wife for intercourse, she must obey him in that. The same applies if he calls her to play with him; she must also obey him, as this is something that helps to perpetuate love and harmony between them.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (2097) and Muslim (715) narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Have you got married?” He said: Yes. He said: “A virgin or a previously-married woman?” He said: A previously-married woman. He said: “Why not a young girl, whom you could play with and she could play with you?”…</p>\n<p>Ahmad (16886) and Abu Dawud (2513) narrated that `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Anything a man does to entertain himself is pointless, except three things: shooting arrows, training his horse, and playing with his wife; these actions are valid and purposeful.”</p>\n<p>It says in <em>al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em> (35/337):</p>\n<p>The hadith indicates that everything a man does to entertain himself which does not benefit him in this life or the hereafter in a religious sense is pointless and objectionable, except these three actions. That is because, if he does them for the purpose of entertaining himself, comforting himself and energizing himself, it is valid, as there is benefit in them. Shooting arrows and training horses help a man to develop fighting skills, and playing with his wife could lead to the birth of a child who will testify to Allah’s oneness and worship Him. That is why these three actions are valid and purposeful, and all others are pointless.</p>\n<p>Al-Khattabi said: This confirms that all forms of entertainment are disallowed, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only exempted these three forms of entertainment from those that are prohibited, because, if you think about it, each one of them is beneficial or leads to something beneficial. End quote.</p>\n<p>One of the most important and sublime rights that the husband has over his wife is the obligation for her to obey him in everything that he tells her to do of things that are right and proper.</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (2140) narrated from Qays ibn Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to instruct anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have instructed women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the rights that Allah has given the husbands over them.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in <em>Sahih Abi Dawud</em>.</p>\n<p>So if a man calls his wife to play with him, she must obey him in that, and that is for several reasons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The obligation to obey him in what is right and proper, and this comes under the heading of what is right and proper.</li>\n<li>Obeying him in that is a means of attaining something that is obligatory, which is keeping him chaste.</li>\n<li>Obeying him in that is a means of fulfilling objectives of marriage such as harmony between the spouses and producing offspring.</li>\n<li>Her playing with him is one of the duties that the Lawgiver has recommended and enjoined.</li>\n<li>If that does not happen, it will create resentment and grudges between them, and the husband will be angry with his wife, as a result of which she will be exposed to the wrath of Allah, may He be Exalted.</li>\n<li>If that does not happen when he asks for it and she refuses, he will feel upset and will feel humiliated and looked down upon, which could result in him not seeking intimacy with her and avoiding her altogether.</li>\n<li>Islam enjoins everything that will increase love between spouses and forbids everything that will spoil the relationship between them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if the wife does not obey her husband when he calls her to play with him, that is contrary to what Islam has enjoined upon her and encouraged her to do.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The majority of scholars are of the view – which is the correct view – that he is obliged to do ghusl, because he is excused (with regard to the prayer).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his case the time that counts is the time that he woke up, because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (177), al-Nasaa’i (615), Abu Dawood (437) and Ibn Maajah (698) from Abu Qataadah who said: They mentioned to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that they fell asleep and missed the prayer. He said: “There is no negligence when one is sleeping, rather there is negligence when one is awake. If any one of you forgets to pray, or sleeps and misses a prayer, then let him pray when he remembers.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. The hadeeth also appears in al-Saheehayn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said, explaining the view of the majority: If water is available but the effort to acquire it and use it means that the time will end, it is not permissible for him to do tayammum, whether he is at home or travelling, according to the majority of scholars including al-Shaafa’i, Abu Thawr, Ibn al-Mundhir, and as-haab al-ra’i. It was narrated from al-Awzaa’i and al-Thawri that he may do tayammum. That was narrated from them by al-Waleed ibn Muslim.

The same applies to one who forgets it. End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: with regard to heating water, if a person has been lazy and got up late from sleeping in the desert, and he is afraid that the time will end –what should he do, should he heat the water or do tayammum?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He has to heat the water even if he is afraid that the time will end, because if the sleeper wakes up late, the time for prayer in his case is when he wakes up from sleep, and not from when the time for that prayer started, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it.” So the time for it begins when he remembers it, for one who forgot it, and when he wakes up, for one who slept. So we say: if you got up about five minutes or ten minutes before sunrise, and if you do tayammum you will manage to pray in time but if you do ghusl the time will end, we say that you should do ghusl even if the time will end, because the time for prayer in your case starts when you wake up, not from when the dawn breaks, because you are excused.

How can the Muslim lawyer serve his ummah? What is your advice to me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\tFirstly:</p>\n<p>\tThe real nature of the lawyer’s \trole is to represent someone in disputes when cases are taken to court in \torder to ward off injustice or attain rights and dues. The basic principle \tregarding this type of representation is that it is permissible.</p>\n<p>\tIbn Qattaan (may Allah have \tmercy on him) said: </p>\n<p>\tThe scholars are unanimously \tagreed that representing someone in disputes and pursuing rights in the \tpresence of the one being represented and with the consent of the opponent, \twhen the person represented is present, is permissible.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from al-Iqnaa‘ \t(2/156).</p>\n<p>\tShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz \t(may Allah have mercy on him) said: </p>\n<p>\tThe lawyer is a person’s \trepresentative in a dispute. This type of representation was known at the \ttime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and up until \tthe present day.

As for one who is in the wrong or has \tno right to a claim, it is not permissible to support him in his falsehood.</p>\n<p>\tAllah, may He be exalted, says \t(interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“And \tcooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and \taggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Maa’idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>\t“<a>And \tdo not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves</a>.\t<a>Indeed, Allah loves not one who is a habitually \tsinful deceiver</a>”</p>\n<p>\t[an-Nisa’ 4:107].</p>\n<p>\tShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di \t(may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\t“And do not argue on behalf \tof those who deceive themselves” in the sense of committing offences \tagainst their own souls. That includes the prohibition on speaking on behalf \tof one who has committed sin for which the punishment is now due, whether it \tis a h@add punishment (specified in sharia) or a ta‘zeer punishment (a \tdisciplinary punishment meted out at the judge’s discretion). So he should \tnot plead on his behalf by trying to prove that he did not do it, or try to \tward off the resulting punishment as dictated by sharia.</p>\n<p>\t“Indeed, Allah loves not one who is a \thabitually sinful deceiver” that is, one who is habitually treacherous \tand sinful. Stating that Allah does not love someone implies the opposite, \twhich is that He hates such a person. This is like the reason why what is \tmentioned above should not be done.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di \t(p. 200)</p>\n<p>\tIt was narrated that Yahya ibn \tRaashid said: We sat waiting for ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar and he came out to us, \tand sat down and said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \tof Allah be upon him) say: “If a person’s intercession prevents one of the \thadd punishments of Allah (from being carried out), then he has opposed \tAllah. The one who argues for a false case knowingly will remain subject to \tthe wrath of Allah until he gives it up. If a person says something of a \tbeliever that is not true, Allah will cause him to dwell in the mud of \tkhabaal (the juice of the people of Hell) until he retracts what he said.”</p>\n<p>\tClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani \tin as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (1/798).</p>\n<p>\tShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may \tAllah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tThe practice of law [as a \tlawyer] refers to the representation of a man so as to prove his case \tagainst his opponent; this is divided into two categories. The first is that \tin which the lawyer seeks to prove a case based on true facts and to protect \tthe rights of the one whom he represents. There is nothing wrong with doing \tthat, because all it is, is one person representing another in return for a \tfee, and representing someone in return for a fee is permissible and there \tis nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<p>\tThe second category of \tpractising law refers to when the lawyer wants to prove a case whether \trightly or wrongly. It is not permissible to do this, because in that case \tthe lawyer will be defending any case, regardless of whether it is valid or \tfalse. This is haraam; rather what the Muslim is required to do, if he sees \tthat his brother’s case is based on falsehood, is to advise him and not \tagree to represent him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \tupon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil, let him change it with his \thand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking \tout); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that \tit is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” </p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Fataawa Noor \t‘ala ad-Darb (11/609-610).</p>\n<p>\tThe Muslim lawyer who practices \this profession on the basis of clear proof and in accordance with Islamic \trulings, and with a sound intention, advising the one whom he represents to \tfear Allah, may He be exalted, and not to demand that to which they have no \tright, and only to pursue what is permissible to them according to Islamic \tteachings, and to acknowledge people’s rights and to be truthful in their \tstatements, words and testimonies, and tells him that fearing Allah, may He \tbe exalted, is the way to a good life in this world and the hereafter, and \tto be kind to those of the poor and weak whose rights are neglected – the \tlawyer who adheres to all of that is doing an important job in rectifying \tsociety.</p>\n<p>\tSecondly: </p>\n<p>\tAs for Islamic studies in your \tspecialty, they are available in Islamic universities and in some colleges \tin which there are Islamic specialties.</p>\n<p>\tIn your country, there is the \tCollege of Sharia and Law in al-Azhar University; you can benefit from its \tcurricula, and if you cannot study there, there are also Islamic sharia \tdepartments in colleges of law and the Centre of Islamic Economics in al-Azhar \tUniversity.</p>\n<p>\tOne of the useful books that we \tcan recommend to you is: at-Tashree‘ al-Jinaa’i al-Islami: Muqaaranan \tbi’l-Qanoon al-Wad‘i by ‘Abd al-Qaadir ‘Awdah.</p>\n<p>\tYou could also benefit from \tMusannafah an-Nuzum al-Islamiyyah by Mustafa Kamaal Wasfi.</p>\n<p>\tWhatever the case, by \tcontinuing to read and study, asking questions of specialists in your \tcountry, you will come to know of books and curricula that will help you to \tachieve your goal.</p>\n<p>\tRegarding the legal profession \tand some of its etiquette, and other issues connected to it, we advise you \tto read the book al-Muhaamaah by Shaykh Mashhoor Hasan Salmaan, which \tyou will find on the following link:</p>\n<p>\t\t<a href=\"http://majles.alukah.net/t66552\">\thttp://majles.alukah.net/t66552</a></p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows best.    </p>\n",

      "title": "He owns an café in which men and women mix",
      "question": "<p>A man owns a high-quality café which has a mixed clientele of men and women. He feels uneasy because of this mixing and fears that the income from this café may come under the heading of things which are forbidden or are doubtful and therefore disallowed in sharee’ah, even though he has told his employees not to sell anything that is forbidden in sharee’ah, such as cigarettes, and he has forbidden his customers to do anything that goes against Islamic etiquette. We would like you to please shed some light on this issue by quoting some verses of Qur’aan and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that we may find some peace of mind and avoid falling into sin, and we may meet our Lord when He is pleased with us. We hope that the answer will be detailed.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    The owner of this café has done well by refusing to sell     forbidden substances in his café, such as refusing to sell cigarettes and     refusing to allow people to do things that go against Islamic etiquette. May     Allaah reward him with good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But it remains for him to forbid mixing, because of the evil     and temptation that it involves. The Qur’aan and Sunnah indicate that mixing     is haraam. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask     them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their     hearts”</p>\n<p>    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]</p>\n<p>    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting     on this verse: i.e., just as it is forbidden for you to enter upon them, it     is also forbidden for you to look at them at all; even if one of you has a     need to ask them for anything, he should not look at them or ask of them     except from behind a screen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This verse     indicates that Allaah has given permission to ask of them from behind a     screen in the case of necessity, or when consulting them about some matter.     This meaning includes all women, because the basic principle of sharee’ah is     that the whole of a woman is ‘awrah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women.     If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in     whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should     be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”</p>\n<p>    [al-Ahzaab 33:32]</p>\n<p>    If there is this warning against being soft of speech lest     the one in whose heart is a disease be moved with desire, then what about     men sitting with women who are clothed yet naked, who go astray and lead     others astray, chatting and laughing together, and looking at one another?     What fitnah can be greater than that? What heart can remain free of sickness     when this is the case?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     took care to prevent men mixing with women even in the dearest spots on     earth to Allaah, namely the mosques, when he separated the rows of men and     women, and he stayed for a while after saying the salaam so that the women     could depart, and he designated a door of the mosque specifically for women.     The evidence for that is as flows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – It was narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased     with her) said: When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) had said the salaam, the women would get up and leave     when they had said the salaam, and he would stay for a while before getting     up to leave. Ibn Shihaab said: I think – and Allaah knows best – that he     stayed a while so that the women could disperse before the men got up to     leave. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 793.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased     with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) said: “Why don’t we leave this door for the women?” Naafi’     said: Ibn ‘Umar never entered through that door until he died. Narrated by     Abu Dawood, 462; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased     with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “The best rows for men are the first ones and the worst are the last,     and the best rows for women are the last ones and the worst are the first.”     Narrated by Muslim, 664.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is among the greatest evidence that Islam forbids     mixing. The further away the men are from the women’s rows the better, and     the further away the women are from the men’s rows the better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If these precautions are to be taken in the mosque which is a     pure place of worship, then taking them in other places is undoubtedly more     important.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    4 – It was narrated from Abu Usayd al-Ansaari that he heard     the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     say, when he was outside the mosque and the men were mixing with the women     in the road. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said to the women: “Move aside, for you have no right to walk in     the middle of the road; you should walk at the sides of the road.” Then a     woman would walk so close to the walls that her garment would catch on the     wall because she walked so close to it.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 5272;     classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more details on the dangers of mixing, please see the     answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/1200\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">1200</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Since mixing is haraam, the owner of this café is committing     sin by allowing it and refraining from denouncing it, and by helping these     people to commit sin by providing a place for them where they can disobey     Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What he has to do is to fear Allaah and not help to spread     evil and corruption among the believers. He should be keen to make his food     good (i.e., from halaal sources), for “every body that is nourished on     haraam, the Fire is more befitting for it,” as the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. Narrated by al-Tabaraani and Abu     Na’eem from Abu Bakr; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’,     no. 4519.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Another version was narrated from Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah: “No flesh     grows that is nourished by haraam but the Fire is more befitting for it.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If he can prevent mixing, then this is what he must do, or     else he can restrict the café to men only. Otherwise he should look for     other, permissible work. Whoever gives up a thing for the sake of Allaah,     Allaah will compensate him with something better than it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He     will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</p>\n<p>    3.&nbsp;And He will provide him from (sources) he never could     imagine”</p>\n<p>    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A married woman commits adultery, then she repented but the guilt of the act is haunting her. She is now thinking about suicide. What should be done and what is your advice?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The believer sees his sin as a mountain beneath which he is sitting and which he fears may fall down upon him. The rebellious person sees his sin as a fly which passes in front of his nose and he swats it away\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6308)</div>\n<p>This woman's overwhelming sense of the burden of her sin is a sign of faith. We offer her the following advice:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>She should examine her divorce from her first husband to make sure that it is sound according to sharee'ah (Islamic law), whether it took the form of talaaq (male-instigated divorce) or khul' (female-instigated divorce).</li>\n<li>She should make sure that her marriage contract to the second man is also sound, because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery is not valid unless they have repented (see questions # <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/649\" target=\"_blank\">649</a> ); if the contract is found not to be valid, it must be repeated.</li>\n<li>If this woman is sincere in her repentance towards Allah, regrets what she did and is determined never to do it again, Allah will forgive all her sins, no matter how great they were, so she should not despair of the mercy of Allah, for no one despairs of Allah's Mercy, except the people who disbelieve, and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are astray?</li>\n<li>She should hasten to do many good deeds, to expiate for her sin, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And perform al-salaat (the prayer) at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds\" [Hud 11:114]</li>\n<li>She should resume a pure Islamic life, based on purity and chastity. Suicide is not a solution at all, as it is one of the most grievous of major sins, and will only increase the punishment of the one who does it. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Whoever throws himself down from a high mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down from a mountain in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever takes poison and kills himself will be taking poison in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever kills himself with a weapon (literally, iron) will be holding it in his hand and stabbing himself in the stomach in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5778)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to help this woman to repent sincerely, to forgive her sins and to include her in His Mercy, for He is the All-hearing Who answers prayers.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The      first khaleefah who succeeded the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and      blessings of Allaah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be      pleased with him), according to the consensus of the respected scholars,      because of the consensus of the Sahaabah who all gave their bay’ah      (allegiance) to him. This was after an initial dispute between the      Muhaajireen and Ansaar, then the Ansaar were convinced and gave their      bay’ah to Abu Bakr, and they did not differ amongst themselves, and they      did not hesitate in making a choice between Abu Bakr and ‘Ali (may      Allaah be pleased with them both). None of the Sahaabah asked to give      bay’ah to ‘Ali after Abu Bakr and before ‘Umar (may Allaah be      pleased with him), and no one asked to give bay’ah to ‘Ali after      ‘Umar – may Allaah be pleased with them all. The fitnah and      differences arose because of the murder of ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be      pleased with him). The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted      for their worldly affairs the one whom the Messenger of Allaah had      accepted for their religious affairs, the one who had acted as the deputy      of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon      him) in leading the prayers [when he was unable to do so – i.e., Abu      Bakr].</p>\n<p>With      regard to what happened at Ghadeer: Ghadeer is the name of a well in a      place between Makkah and Madeenah which is called Khum. The hadeeth was      narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh      (no. 2408) from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up and addressed us one      day at a well called Khum, between Makkah and Madeenah. He praised Allaah      and exhorted and reminded us. Then he said: ‘I am leaving among you two      important things: the first of which is the Book of Allaah’ – and he      urged us to adhere to the Book of Allaah, then he said: ‘And the people      of my household (ahl bayti).      I remind you of Allaah with regard to the people of my household, I remind      you of Allaah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of      Allaah with regard to the people of my household.’” Zayd said: his      wives are among the people of his household, but the people of his      household who are forbidden to receive sadaqah (charity) after his death      are the family of ‘Ali, the family of ‘Aqeel, the family of Ja’far      and the family of ‘Abbaas. All of these are forbidden to receive      sadaqah.” [abbreviated version].</p>\n<p>                  His advice concerning the people of his household has to do with honouring      and respecting them, and not exposing them to abuse or annoyance. This      does not mean that they are to be given preference over others who are      known through the texts to be more virtuous than them, such as Abu Bakr,      ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with them all).</p>\n",

Al-Bukhari (379) and Muslim (513) narrated that Maymunah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray on a khumrah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A khumrah is a small mat made of palm leaves that is big enough for the face, on which a worshipper may prostrate to protect himself from the heat or coldness of the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Khattabi favoured the view that the khumrah may be bigger than that, and he quoted as evidence the report narrated by Abu Dawud (5247) from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: A mouse came and started dragging the wick of the lamp and threw it in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), on the khumrah on which he was sitting, and it burned an area the size of a dirham… (This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 4369.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: “This clearly shows that the word khumrah may apply to a large mat. This was also stated in al-Nihayah.”&nbsp;(See Fath al-Bari, 333)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shawkani said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This hadith indicates that there is nothing wrong with praying on a mat, regardless of whether it is made of rags, palm leaves or anything else, whether it is small or big, like a mat or carpet, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed on mats, carpets and animal pelts.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cases_where_it_is_not_permissible_to_pray_on_carpets\">Cases where it is not permissible to pray on carpets</span></h3>\n<p>But there may be some reasons why it is not permissible to pray on carpets and similar things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the carpet contains images of animate beings; in which case it is haram to keep them and the images must be blotted out. Please see question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12422\" target=\"_blank\">12422</a> .&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If the carpet has decorations and patterns that attract the attention of the worshipper and distract him from his prayer; praying on such carpets is makruh.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to pictures of inanimate objects such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plants, trees, houses and so on, so long as there are no images of living beings in or around them, these are permissible, but praying on them is makruh because they distract the worshipper and detract from his proper focus and humility (khushu’) in prayer, but his prayer is still valid.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 6/180)</p>\n<p>They also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The mosques are the houses of Allah, built for the establishment of prayer and the glorification of Allah and the fear of Allah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patterns and decorations in the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50407\" target=\"_blank\">furnishings</a> and on the walls of the mosques are things that distract the heart from the remembrance of Allah and take away much of the worshippers’ proper focus and humility. Hence they were regarded as makruh by many of the salaf. So the Muslims should avoid that in their mosques and strive to make their worship perfect by keeping distractions away from the places in which they seek to draw close to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, hoping to increase their reward. But with regard to praying (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/90097\" target=\"_blank\">on carpets decorated with such patterns</a> ), it is valid.”&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If praying on the rug is done in order to avoid praying on the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (2036) narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We observed i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the middle ten days of Ramadan, and we came out on the morning of the twentieth. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the morning of the twentieth and said: “I was shown Laylat al-Qadr but then I was made to forget it, so seek it in the last ten nights, on the odd-numbered nights. I saw that I was prostrating in water and mud. Whoever was observing i’tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), let him go back.” So the people went back to the mosque, and we did not see any trace of a cloud in the sky. Then a cloud came and it rained, and the iqamah for prayer was given, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated in mud and water until we saw the marks of mud on the tip of his nose and his face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by Muslim (1167): “And his forehead was covered with mud and water.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith points to the humility of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as he prostrated on water and mud, and he did not order that something be brought for him to prostrate on.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If praying on the rug is done to avoid praying on the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/213229\" target=\"_blank\">carpets</a> that are spread for all the people in the mosque, or if a person does that to be on the safe side because there may be some impurity (najasah) on the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to those who suffer from extreme waswasah (whispers from the Shaytan), they do not pray on the ground or on the carpets spread out for everyone on the ground, rather they pray on a rug or something similar…” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/177)&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a man seeks to pray on the rug because he thinks that it is essential to have a rug just for prayer and that he has to pray on something whether he is at home or in the mosque. Many people only ever pray on the rug even if the house is carpeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Praying on rugs, in the sense that the worshipper insists on that – this was not the way of the salaf, the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth at the time of the Messenger of Allah. Rather they used to pray on the ground in his mosque, and none of them had a rug that was used just for prayer. It was narrated that when ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi came to Madinah he spread out a rug, and Malik ordered that it be taken away. It was said to him, “He is ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi.” Malik said, “Do you not know that spreading a rug in our mosque is bid’ah (an innovation)?”’ (&nbsp;Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/163)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The same applies to the practice in many mosques of having a rug that is just for the imam, which is set out for him to pray on, even though the mosque is carpeted. Why is he distinguished from the other worshippers??</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not appropriate because there is no need for it, and because that may make him feel somewhat superior to the people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The point is that putting down rugs in a carpeted mosque is a bid`ah unless there is a reason for that, such as it being very cold, or the floor being rough or the first carpet being impure or filthy, and so on.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah.

One of us said, ‘We see that you appear to be in high spirits today.’ He said, ‘Yes, praise be to Allah.’ Then the people spoke about riches.

This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, no. 1741)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Aims_of_playing_sports_in_Islam\">Aims of playing sports in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>The Muslim’s aim in playing sports should be to strengthen himself to do acts of worship and to support the religion of Allah, to defend His sacred limits and to protect the honour of the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If that is not the case, then at the very least he should aim to earn himself a living in this world, protect himself from enemies or use his physical strength to earn a living, so that it will be a means of him eating from what he earns with his own hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Miqdam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man eats better food than the one who earns it with his own hands. The Prophet of Allah Dawud (peace be upon him) used to eat from what he earned with his own hands.&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1966)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For one of you to chop wood and carry it on his back is better for him than asking (begging) from anyone who will either give him something or refuse to give him anything.”&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1968; Muslim, 1042)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_boxing_haram\">Is boxing haram?</span></h3>\n<p>This is with regard to permissible kinds of sports. But from what we see nowadays, most sports have gone beyond that and are no longer permissible; they have become haram, especially <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10427\" target=\"_blank\">boxing</a> which is the worst of sports, for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It involves attacking the face, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you has a fight with his brother, let him avoid the face.”&nbsp;(Al-Bukhari, 2560; Muslim, 2612). This game is based on hitting the face of one's opponent with the strongest blow the boxer can muster.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It is a waste of time. Allah has bestowed many blessings upon the Muslim, and He will question him about them on the Day of Resurrection. But people think little of these blessings and waste many of them such as good health and free time. One of the things that Allah will question the Muslim about on the Day when he meets Him will be his youth and what he did with it, and his life and how he spent it. What will this man say who spent his youth and his life training to fight people and wrestle with them and box with them in order to gain a title or win a prize?&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:</p>\n<p>“If a person should not waste his money on things that are of no benefit, it is even more important that he not waste his time, because time is more precious than money, and because the fact that the young and the not-so-young waste their time on these sorts of games that are of no benefit to them is something that is very unfortunate and regrettable.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/435)&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It is a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3895\" target=\"_blank\">harmful sport</a> which can lead to irreparable damage, and Allah has forbidden us to harm our bodies, which He has commanded us to preserve and protect.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) decreed that there should be no harm or reciprocation of harm. (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2340; Ahmad, 21714; this hadith was classed as sahih by Imam Ahmad and al-Hakim, and as hasan by Ibn al-Salah)&nbsp;(See Khalasat al-Badr al-Munir, by Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 2/438)</p>\n<p>Because of your practising this sport, you know that there are many boxers who have been permanently injured, especially with damage to the brain and nerves. &nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It involves wasting money and wasting people’s time with something that is of no benefit. Instead of being wasted on this useless entertainment, that money could have been spent on charitable causes. How many millions are wasted that could have been spent on feeding the hungry, building a mosque, opening a school or other good works?&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">These sports – including boxing – have become an excuse for tribalism and nationalism. Sport, as it exists nowadays, has divided people and made people love or hate one another on the basis of the victory or defeat of a team.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">It involves uncovering the ‘awrah, even if you do not do that, your opponent will. The man's ‘awrah is from the navel to the knee, as was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Similarly, it involves uncovering of the spectators’ ‘awrahs, both men and women. This is something that you cannot ward off or even denounce them for.</p>\n<p>You say in your question that you will not fight Muslims, but will the people who organize the matches allow you that? I don’t think so, and you know better than we do.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Boxing_for_Islam_Possible\">Boxing for Islam: Possible?</span></h3>\n<p>These fights are not held for the sake of religion, and they are not based on that. When people watch a fight, they do not think that this is a fight between Islam and disbelief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, when you fight, you will be fighting in the name of the country where you live, or which has given you its nationality; they will not allow you to fight in the name of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And even if your opponent is a disbeliever, he may be from among the people with whom there is peace (ahl al-silm), not those who are in a state of war with the Muslims (ahl al-harb), so what right do you have to raise your hand against a man who is at peace with us?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this sport is one of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22305\" target=\"_blank\">haraam games</a> that causes more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Boxing_for_jihad\">Boxing for jihad</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to your saying that you intend to go for jihad one day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are beautiful words, even if boxing is haram. You can strengthen your body by doing other sports that are not haram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I took some abortion pills to open the cervix of the uterus in preparation for a surgery, but I was not pregnant; that was only for the surgical procedure. Some bleeding occurred; it was spotting in the beginning, then the amount increased. What should I do about my prayer until the time of the procedure? If bleeding occurs after the surgery, should I pray or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is well-known that taking such pills may cause disruption in a woman’s menstrual cycle, causing the period to come earlier than usual, or increasing the number of days it lasts.</p>\n<p>A number of scholars favour the view that a woman should look at the blood that is emitted because of these pills:</p>\n<p>If it has the characteristics of menstrual blood, such as if it is deep red and thick, with a characteristic smell, then it is menstrual blood and therefore she cannot pray, fast or have intercourse.</p>\n<p>But if it is light red with no smell, then it is simply bleeding, and comes under the rulings on istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding]. In that case, the woman should wash the blood from herself, do wudoo’ and pray, and she should wear sanitary pads to prevent the blood spreading.</p>\n<p>If the menses is stopped by means of pills or otherwise, then the woman is deemed to be taahir [pure; free of menses] as a result of that; by the same token, menstrual bleeding that occurs as a result of taking pills means that she is indeed menstruating.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a breast-feeding woman whose menses was slow in resuming, so she took medicine to bring about menstruation, and she had three periods or menstrual cycles. She was recently divorced; has her ‘iddah ended or not?</p>\n<p>He replied: Yes, if her regular menses occurred as a result of that, then it is to be counted as such [and she has completed her ‘iddah thereby]. Similarly, if she took medicine to stop her menses, or to increase the time between one period and the next, then she becomes pure thereby; and if she got hungry or tired or something else happened that affected her physically and caused her to bleed, then this is to be regarded as menses.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (34/23, 24).</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta’ were asked: Nowadays, women use artificial methods of contraception, such as pills and IUDs, and any doctor will agree to insert an IUD or prescribe pills, and before that he will give the woman two pills to confirm that she is not pregnant, after which she has to bleed if there is no pregnancy.</p>\n<p>My question is: with regard to this bleeding that comes within these few days, does it come under the same ruling as menstrual bleeding, with regard to not praying or fasting or having intercourse? Please note that the duration of this bleeding is not at the same time as her regular menses.</p>\n<p>Similarly, after having an IUD inserted or using pills, for some women the pattern of the menstrual cycle changes, and it may increase suddenly after using contraception, to the extent that some of them do not become pure for more than a week out of the month; the bleeding lasts for three consecutive weeks, and the blood in this case is the same as the blood that comes during menses. The same may also apply to the bleeding that occurs when taking two pills to confirm that there is no pregnancy, as mentioned in the previous question.</p>\n<p>My question here is: what is the ruling on the woman during this three-week period? Is it the same as the ruling on menses? Or should she follow what was her usual cycle before taking that contraceptive, regardless of whether her period was usually one week or ten days?</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>If the bleeding that occurred after taking the two pills was the same as the woman’s usual menses, then this blood is menses, and at that time she should stop fasting and praying. But if it was otherwise, then it is not regarded as menstrual blood that means that she cannot fast, pray or have intercourse, because it only happened as a result of taking the pills.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (5/402).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about menses that results from taking pills, and he said:</p>\n<p>The woman should ask the doctor; if he says that this is menses, then it is menses, and if he says that this is excretions caused by those pills, then it is not menses.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa wa Duroos al-Haram al-Makki, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (2/284).</p>\n<p>The same ruling applies to bleeding that occurs after the surgery. It should also be looked at, and if it appears to be menstrual bleeding, then you should stop praying and fasting, but if it does not appear to be menstrual bleeding, then you are like one who is experiencing istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding).</p>\n<p>It should be noted that any bleeding that lasts beyond fifteen days of the month is not regarded as menses, and it comes under the rulings on istihaadah, according to the majority of scholars.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/67777\">67777</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She wore niqaab during Hajj; is there any sin on her?",
      "question": "<p>A couple of years back i went for the holy pilgrimage of hajj . at the time i performed the hajj wearing a nikab , it has come to my attention that its not permissable for women to cover their faces during the pilgrimage . when i did wear the nikab , i was informed by good sources that it was permissable .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>1 – Covering the face is something good for women. May Allah bestow abundant mercy on the women who cover their faces with niqaab. Perhaps your question is based on keenness for your religion – may Allah increase your keenness – but it is better to heed the commands of the religion, which tells women to remove the niqaab from their faces during prayer and Hajj, but especially during prayer, when it is not permissible to cover the face at all except if there are non-mahram men present. During Hajj it is permissible for women to lower the veil over their faces provided that it does not cling to their faces; this is what is called the burqa’. It is not permissible for the woman in ihram to wear it, but it is permissible for her to lower over her face a cover which comes down from her head over her face. If the burqa’ is not available, and there are men present who should not see the woman’s face, then it is permissible for her to wear the niqaab.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what kind of clothes do you command us to wear during ihram?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not wear a shirt or pants or a turban or a burnous. If one of you does not have any sandals then let him wear the khuffayn (leather slippers) and cut them so that they come below the ankle. Do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or turmeric. Women in ihram should not wear niqaab or gloves.”</p>\n<p>(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1468; Muslim, 1177).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – With regard to lowering a cover over the face other than the niqaab, or for fear of being seen by non-mahram men, it has been reported in saheeh reports that some of the Sahaabiyyaat (women of the Sahaabah) did that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “We used to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when we were in ihram. If we met the riders we would lower our garments over our faces.</p>\n<p>(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman in ihram to cover her face; rather he forbade the niqaab only because it is worn on the face. He differentiated between the niqaab and covering the face. Based on this, if a woman in ihram covers her face, we say there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better for her to uncover it so long as there are no non-mahram men around her, in which case she should cover her face from them. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/153&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – With regard to the past and the Hajj that you did in the manner you describe, there is no sin on you because you were unaware. If a person does something that is not allowed during ihram because he was unaware or he forgot, there is no sin on him, and he does not have to offer any fidyah (ransom).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ya’la ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in al-Ji’raanah and entered ihram for ‘Umrah. The man had dyed his beard and hair with saffron, and he was wearing a jubbah (cloak). He said, “Take off your jubbah and wash off your saffron, and whatever you do in your Hajj, do in your ‘Umrah.”</p>\n<p>(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1697; Muslim, 1180).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similar to forgetting are cases where one is unaware or is forced to do something, i.e., if a person forgets and puts on ordinary clothes when he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he has to take them off and put on the izaar and rida’ (ihram garments). The same applies to perfume; if he puts on perfume, forgetting that he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he must hasten to wash it off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/222</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Ghusul</div>\n<div>I had intercourse with my husband and had my hair done just before that (I have Hijab). Do I have to rinse my hair entirely or can I just wipe it with water from the outside. May God reward you with goodness.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>When performing ghusl because of janaabah (impurity, e.g. after intercourse), both men and women must wash their heads and ensure that the water reaches the roots of the hair; it is not sufficient merely to wipe the head. A woman who wears her hair in braids is excused from having to undo her braids when doing ghusl because of janaabah, due to the difficulty involved in doing them up again. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who wears her hair in braids. Do I have to undo my braids when I make ghusl because of janaabah?’ He said, ‘No, it is enough if you pour water on your head three times, and then over the rest of your body. That will make you clean.’”</p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim, no. 497).</p>\n<p>But in the case of a woman who has ended her period or nifaas (post-natal bleeding), she has to undo her braids when she does ghusl.

      "title": "He was not sure about the number of prostrations, and he omitted the prostration of forgetfulness out of ignorance; what is the ruling on his prayer?",
      "question": "<p>He was not sure about the number of prostrations, so he proceeded on the basis of what was certain, and did another prostration, based on the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz, then he did not do the prostration of forgetfulness after the prayer, thinking that he did not have to do it. Is his prayer valid?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If a person is unsure about the number of prostrations, in the sense that he is not sure whether he prostrated once or twice, then he should proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is the smaller number. So he should assume that he has done one prostration, and do a second prostration; then he should do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam, by way of preference. This view is the one favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to uncertainty in the prayer, he should do another prostration and proceed on the basis of what is certain. If he is not sure whether he prostrated once or twice, he should do another prostration, whether that is in the first rak‘ah or in the second, third or fourth, and he should do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam, but if he does it after the salaam it does not matter, although it is preferable to do it before the salaam.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz (30/11)</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that uncertainty about not having done essential parts of the prayer is like uncertainty concerning the number of rak‘ahs, so one should proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is the smaller number, if one of the two possibilities is not more likely in his view, and in this case he should do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam.</p>\n<p>But if one of the two possibilities is more likely in his view, then he should proceed on that basis, and in that case the prostration of forgetfulness should come after the salaam.</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“If he is not certain about having omitted an essential part of the prayer, then it is as if he did omit it” – this is our view and it is the view of most of our companions, and was stated definitively by some of them. And it was said that he should try to work it out and proceed on the basis of what he thinks most likely to be the case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Insaaf (2/150)</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“If he is not certain about having omitted an essential part of the prayer, then it is as if he did omit it” – that is, if he is not sure whether he did that essential part or omitted it, then the ruling in this case is the same as the ruling on one who did omit it.</p>\n<p>For example, if he got up to do the second rak‘ah, then was not sure whether he had prostrated twice or only once,</p>\n<p>Uncertainty about whether one omitted an essential part of the prayer is like omitting it, because the basic principle is that it was not done. So if he was uncertain as to whether he had done it, but he thinks it most likely that he did do it, then according to the more correct view, which is that one should act upon what one thinks most likely to be the case, then he is deemed to have done it and he does not have to do go back and repeat it, because we stated that if he is uncertain about the number of rak‘ahs, he should proceed on the basis of what he thinks was likely to be the case, but he has to do the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (3/384)</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that whoever omits to do the prostration of forgetfulness because he forgot to do it should make it up so long as it is not been a long time since he finished the prayer. However, if a long time has passed since he finished the prayer, then the prostration of forgetfulness is waived in his case, and his prayer is valid.</p>\n<p>Al-Bahooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If he forgets the prostration (of forgetfulness), and it was preferable to do it before saying the salaam, then he should make it up. If he has started another prayer, then he should make it up when he has said the salaam at the end of that prayer, if only a short time has elapsed and he has not invalidated his wudoo’ or left the mosque. But if a long time has elapsed, according to custom, or he invalidated his wudoo’ or left the mosque, then he should not make up the prostration of forgetfulness, because the time for it has passed, but his prayer is still valid – as in the case of all other obligatory (waajib) duties if a person forgets to do them by mistake.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat (1/235)</p>\n<p>With regard to this matter, the one who is ignorant is like the one who forgot.</p>\n<p>It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol 2 – 6/10):</p>\n<p>If he omitted the prostration of forgetfulness deliberately, his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat it. If he omitted it because he forgot or was ignorant of the ruling, then he does not have to repeat it and his prayer is valid. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>If a person does too many rak‘ahs in the prayer, or omits anything from it, and does not do the prostration of forgetfulness, is the prayer rendered invalid?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>That depends. If he decided to omit this prostration whilst he was praying, if he did that deliberately and was aware of the shar‘i ruling, then his prayer is rendered invalid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he was ignorant of the ruling or forgot, then it is not rendered invalid, and his prayer is still valid.</p>\n<p>End quote from <a href=\"http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/15296\" target=\"_blank\">Fatawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb</a> by Ibn Baz</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer&nbsp;to question&nbsp;no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/95410\" target=\"_blank\">95410</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The prohibition on masturbation is not from a medical point of view only",
      "question": "<p>I have an important question about masturbation. I have read the previous fatwa on it but am curious as to whether it may be changed due to new knowledge. One of the things I read about, why masturbation is haram is because of the ‘negative effects’ of it. However research done by professors has proven that all the old myths about it are false. Scientific research has actually proven the opposite that masturbation has many health benefits. I will name a few, it promotes the release of endorphins, the neurotransmitters associated with happy feelings that can improve the overall mood and fight off depression. It produces a chemical called oxytocin which works as a natural pain and improves pain resistance and tolerance. Masturbation also releases cortisol which improves the immune system. Masturbation has also been proven to help in the prevention of type-2 diabetes and prostate cancer by releasing cancer causing agents. Due to the fact that masturbation is not directly declared haram by Quran or hadith doesn’t the decision rest with whether it benefits of harms a person? With the present facts in mind it is obvious and scientifically proven that there are many effective health benefits of masturbation. And also the old myths and misconceptions about any harm it was thought to cause have been proven false. With the apparent facts wouldn’t the ruling on masturbation be changed as the benefit clearly outweighs any harm it was believed to have caused?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the shar‘i ruling was worked out on the basis of medical information only, and the medical findings changed, then in that case the shar‘i ruling would also change according to new medical findings. That is like the change in the ruling on smoking – over the years – for example. Because medical knowledge when tobacco first appeared and was used for smoking did not indicate that there was any real physical harm from tobacco, the fatwas of many scholars at that time said that it was permissible to deal with tobacco, consume it and buy and sell it. But when medical science advanced and new medical research proved the grievous harm that smoking causes to the human body, the shar‘i ruling changed and it was prohibited. The fatwas of most contemporary scholars state that it is prohibited, because the ruling on smoking is based on medical findings and the harms and benefits that tobacco may cause. It is not something based on specific religious texts.</p>\n<p>The agreed-upon fiqhi principle states that the ruling is connected to the reason for it, and the ruling applies when the reason for it is present, and does not apply when the reason is absent. See Tahqeeq al-Burhaan fi Sha’n ad-Dukhaan by Mar‘i al-Karami (d. 1033 AH), annotated by Mashhoor Hasan Salmaan.</p>\n<p>This in fact is not a change to the shar‘i ruling; rather it is a change in the view of the scholars that is based on the findings on smoking and the harm it causes.</p>\n<p>As for masturbation, or the “secret habit”, the reason for its prohibition as mentioned by the scholars is not physical harm only. Rather it is aimed at preventing physical desires from dominating a person’s thinking, and not allowing any way of fulfilling those desires except through halaal marriage. We may note this idea in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts).</p>\n<p>Except from their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame;</p>\n<p>But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors”&nbsp;[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-7].</p>\n<p>The shar‘i reason for not allowing it is based on the apparent meaning of this verse, which the scholars may understand in various ways and reach a number of conclusions:</p>\n<p>It is aimed at barring the means of fulfilling these overwhelming desires that may go beyond the secret habit to looking for haram means such as watching movies, engaging in unlawful relationships and looking at images.</p>\n<p>It is aimed at protecting man’s power of reasoning and physical energy from being wasted in an inappropriate manner. Or it may be prohibited on the grounds that it is contrary to dignity, and so as to protect the individual from doing base and ignoble actions which serve no purpose, therefore it could be prohibited on moral grounds, as Imam Ahmad ibn Hazm said: We disapprove of it, because it is contrary to noble characteristics and virtuous deeds. End quote from al-Muhalla (12/407).</p>\n<p>Medicine is also one of the reasons that could be understood from the verse. That is because doctors have affirmed the harm of this practice and its addictive nature that could lead to ruining one’s health. So medicine is not the only reason for this shar‘i ruling, such that it might be said that the ruling should change with changes in medical findings.</p>\n<p>We searched the books of the fuqaha’ and we did not find anyone who limited the reasons for the prohibition on masturbation to medical findings on its harm. Rather we found in the words of ash-Shawkaani that which indicates that medical knowledge is just one of the reasons for the prohibition; it is not the only reason. That is when he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Among the reasons they cited is the fact that masturbation is harmful, as was mentioned by physicians. End quote from al-Fath ar-Rabbaani (7/3380).</p>\n<p>We say all of this on the assumption that what is mentioned of health benefits of the secret habit is actually correct. But proving that requires proper scientific studies or the support of specialists whose views are based on definitive academic research, not just quoting some statements (of unknown people) from here and there, because such quotations do not constitute knowledge or a sound view.</p>\n<p>We refer you to what has been written on some medical websites that are supervised by specialists, for you will find some beneficial information there, in sha Allah:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.altibbi.com/definition/masturbation\">http://www.altibbi.com/definition/masturbation</a></p>\n<p>For more information on the ruling on masturbation from our website, please see the following numbers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/329\" target=\"_blank\">329</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20161\" target=\"_blank\">20161</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/101539\" target=\"_blank\">101539</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the point at which one should stand up to pray. There are several opinions that were mentioned by an-Nawawi in al-Majmoo‘ (3/233), and they are as follows:</p>\n<p>(i)That he should stand up when the muezzin starts to recite the Iqamah. This is the view of ‘Ata’ and az-Zuhri</p>\n<p>(ii)That he should stand up when the muezzin says “hayya ‘ala as-salah (come to prayer)”. This is the view of Abu Haneefah.</p>\n<p>(iii)That he should stand up when the muezzin has completed the Iqamah. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i.</p>\n<p>(iv)That there is no specific point at which one should stand up; rather it is permissible for the worshipper to stand up at the beginning of the Iqamah, during it or at the end of it. This is the view of the Maalikis.</p>\n<p>(v)That it is Sunnah to stand up when the muezzin says “Qad qaamat is-salah (prayer is about to begin)” if the worshipper can see the imam; if he cannot see him, then he should stand up when he does see the imam. This is the view of Imam Ahmad.</p>\n<p>There is no clear evidence from the Sunnah to support any of these opinions; rather this is the ijtihaad worked out by the imams according to what each of them thought was correct.</p>\n<p>Based on that, the matter is broad in scope, so the worshipper may stand up whenever he wants, at the beginning of the Iqamah or during it. But the Sunnah indicates that if the muezzin gives the Iqamah for prayer when the imam has not yet entered the mosque, then the worshippers may not stand up until they see him.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Abu Qataadah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Iqamah for prayer is given, do not stand up until you see me.”. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (637) and Muslim (604). According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Until you see that I have come out.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Rushd al-Maaliki said: … If this is sound – i.e., the hadith of Abu Qataadah quoted above, then it must be followed, otherwise the issue remains as is, and may be overlooked, meaning that there is no prescription concerning it, but whenever a person stands up, it is fine.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/112).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there any mention in the Sunnah of a specific time to stand up for prayer when the Iqamah is recited?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>The Sunnah does not say anything specific about standing up, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not stand up until you see me.” So whether a person stands up at the beginning of the Iqamah, or whilst it is being recited, or when it ends, all of that is permissible. End quote.</p>\n<p>Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (13/8).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not prescribed to give the Iqamah for any but the five daily prayers.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not prescribed to give the Adhan or Iqamah for any but the five [daily prayers], whether they are in fulfiment of a vow or the funeral prayer or a Sunnah prayer, and whether it is prescribed to offer them in congregation, such as the Eid prayers, eclipse prayers and prayer for rain (istisqaa’) or not, such as Duhaa prayer. … This is the view of the majority of scholars of the earlier and later generations.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (3/83).</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9360</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have to pay zakah on all the wealth that you have in the form of cash or products offered for sale in the stationery store after one full (Hijri) year has passed, if their value meets the minimum threshold for zakah (nisab).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/313.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The nisab is twenty mithqaal of gold, i.e., eighty-five grams; or one hundred and forty mithqaal of silver (i.e., 595 grams). The equivalent in Saudi dirhams of silver is fifty-six riyals.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa al-‘Uthaymeen, 18/93.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the value of the goods offered for sale, plus the cash money that you have is equal to one of these two nisabs, gold or silver, then you have to pay zakah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/257.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How zakah is to be calculated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If one year has passed for the threshold, you should calculate how much money you have, and add to that the value of the goods offered for sale in the stationery store, then pay one-quarter of one-tenth (i.e., 2.5%) of the total, which you should give to those who are entitled to it of the groups mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“As-Sadaqaat (here it means zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise”&nbsp;[Al-Tawbah 9:60]</p>\n<p>The value of the goods on sale in the stationery store should be based on the price for which they are sold, not the price for which they were bought. See question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/26236\" target=\"_blank\">26236</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the photographic equipment, there is no zakah on it, unless you have prepared it for sale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no zakah on items that are for use, whether they are tools or other things. The basic principle is that whatever is prepared for sale is that on which zakah is due. Tools or equipment used in the store are not subject to zakah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fatawa Ibn Baz, 14/184.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for me to wake my wife for Fajr prayer knowing that she breastfeeds her small daughter during the night and sometimes she is very exhausted?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Prayer is very important,     and we are commanded to offer prayers at the prescribed times; we are urged     to do that and we are warned against neglecting it. This is well known. For     example, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, As‑Salaah (the     prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’ 4:103]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Guard strictly (five     obligatory) As‑Salawaat (the prayers) especially the middle Salaah (i.e. the     best prayer ‑ ‘Asr). And stand before Allaah with obedience”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:238]</p>\n<p>And the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when he was asked which deed is     most beloved to Allaah: “Prayer offered on time.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari     (527) and Muslim (85).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you should beware of     missing prayer or delaying it until the time for it is over, because Allaah     says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Then, there has     succeeded them a posterity who have given up As‑Salaah (the prayers) [i.e.     made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by     not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed     times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”</p>\n<p>[Maryam 19:59]</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to     delay prayers beyond their appointed time unless that is for a reason that     makes it permissible to join prayers at the time of the earlier or later     prayer. It is well known that Fajr prayer cannot be joined with any prayer     before or after it, so it must be offered on time, no matter how sick or     tired a person is, so long as he is conscious and of sound mind. He should     pray standing, but if he cannot then he may offer it sitting, and if he     cannot do that then he may pray lying down. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sleeper should take     precautions to help him wake up, such as not staying up late, setting an     alarm clock and asking others to help him wake up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The husband is enjoined to     take care of his family and save them from the Fire, as Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Ward     off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and     stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey     not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that     which they are commanded”</p>\n<p>[al-Tahreem 66:6]</p>\n<p>Based on this, you should     be keen to wake up your wife and encourage her and help her to pray; you can     delay waking her up until it is nearly the end of the time for prayer. We     ask Allaah to guide and help us and you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible for him to open a business offering treatment with ruqyah and cupping?",
      "question": "<p>I am a young Muslim man who is among those who call people to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. Three years ago I started to recite ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah for people, according to proper guidelines but not in any organized fashion, in return for money which I use on some of my needs. Allaah decreed that my ruqyahs be accepted and Allaah has healed many people at my hands and guided others to the right path and helped them to believe in His Oneness and to keep away from shirk, despite the hassles that I have faced from some of the charlatans, biased people and those who seek to prevent shar’i ruqyah which they describe as bid’ah and haraam earnings. Too many people started coming to me and urging to help them because there are no people who devote their time to reciting ruqyah. All of these people are coming to me for ruqyah in my home which is very humble, which causes me a lot of hardship and difficulty, and it bothers my family because people knock at the door so much, and I have started to neglect my other duties because of reciting ruqyah for them because I feel too shy to refuse. I thought of renting a place which I can use specifically for reciting ruqyah as prescribed in sharee’ah and cupping in return for approximately 20 riyals for doing ruqyah for one person, and that charge will go towards paying the rent and some of my essential needs. But I was surprised when some Muslims who claim to have knowledge denounced me for specializing in this and said that specializing in this was a bid’ah and was not known among the salaf of this ummah, and that money earned in this way is haraam. <br />\n<br />\nIt is permissible to open a clinic for ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah and cupping in return for money, especially since I am in need and am not well off, and I have responsibilities towards my family, and I am suffering from a chronic illness and cannot do heavy work, and the Muslims are in need of someone who can specialize in ruqyah and call them to Tawheed and forbid them from shirk? <br />\n<br />\nIf it is permissible to open a Qur’aanic clinic, then after that I find a job, there are further questions to be answered: <br />\n<br />\n1-  Should I stop doing ruqyah and take this job even though this would result in several negative consequences such as not being able to do this good deed and this will create a vacuum in this area?<br />\n<br />\n2-  Should I combine both and try to reconcile between them without letting one of them affect the other?<br />\n<br />\n3-  Should I refuse to work and be content with doing ruqyah because it benefits others and serves the interests of the Muslims? <br />\n<br />\nIf it is not permissible to open a Qur’aanic clinic: <br />\n<br />\n1-   Should I stop doing ruqyah altogether?<br />\n<br />\n2-   Is it better to carry on doing ruqyah in my house and not specialize in it, and put up with people’s annoyances?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the situation is as described, that you recite ruqyahs     that are prescribed in sharee’ah and the people really need that, then we     ask Allaah to reward you and help you and guide you. There is nothing wrong     with you receiving payment in return for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: We     heard of some people who treat others by means of the Qur’aan; they recite     Qur’aan and du’aa’s that are prescribed in sharee’ah over water or olive oil     as a remedy for witchcraft, the evil eye and madness (the touch of the     shaytaan), and they receive payment for that. Is this permissible according     to sharee’ah? Does reciting over water or olive oil come under the same     ruling as reciting over the sick person himself?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with receiving payment for reciting     ruqyah for one who is sick, because it is proven in al-Saheehayn that     a group of the Companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they made came near     one of the Arab tribes. (These people were either kaafirs or very stingy, as     Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in al-Madaarij). They asked them for hospitality but     they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they     tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why don’t     you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have     something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been     stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you     have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allaah. I will perform ruqyah for     him, but by Allaah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us     anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something     in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on     him and recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen. Then he recovered     quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong     with him. Then they have them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the     Sahaabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said,     Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see     what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He     said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” Then he said, “You did the     right thing.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2115) and Muslim(4080).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with reciting over water or olive oil     to treat the sick person, the one on whom a spell has been cast or the one     who is insane, but reciting over the patient and blowing over him is better     and preferable. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated with a     hasan isnaad that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) recited over water for Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas and poured it over     him. And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah that does not involve shirk.” Muslim     (4079). This saheeh hadeeth is general in meaning and includes ruqyah     recited over the patient himself and ruqyah recited over water and olive oil     etc. And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz     (19/338).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about a man     who performed ruqyah for people in return for payment, and he did not know     anything but that which was proven from the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he referred to the books of     trustworthy scholars concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the situation is as you describe and you treat the sick     with ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah, and you do not recite any     ruqyahs except those that are proven from the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), and you are keen to refer concerning that     to that which was stated by the great scholar Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have     mercy on him) in his well known books, and what was written by the great     scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Zaad     al-Ma’aad and other similar books by Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, then     you work is permissible, and your efforts are appreciated and will be     rewarded in sha Allaah. And there is nothing wrong with you receiving     payment for that, because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah     be pleased with him) to which you referred in your question. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri is the hadeeth mentioned     above, about reciting al-Faatihah as a ruqyah for the man who had been stung     by a scorpion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As ruqyah is permissible and it is permissible to receive     payment for it, it makes no difference whether that is in your home or in a     rented place, or in separate premises, so as to ward off hardship for the     family at home. There is no basis for those who object to that on the     grounds that it is not known that the salaf earned a living in this manner;     once it is proven that job is permissible and that being paid for it is     permissible, the view that this profession is haraam is the view of one who     speaks without knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari said in his Saheeh in Kitaab al-Ijaarah     (the Book of Employment): Chapter on what is given for reciting the Opening     of the Book (al-Faatihah) as a ruqyah for an Arab tribe. Ibn ‘Abbaas     narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):     “The most deserving thing for which you receive payment is the Book of     Allaah.” End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/71303\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">71303</a> we stated that there is a     difference of scholarly opinion with regard to receiving payment for     cupping. The correct view is that it is permissible and is not haraam. The     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only disallowed it     in the sense of it being makrooh, not haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with you opening a clinic to treat     people with ruqyah and cupping, as stated above. Even if you find other     work, you do not have to give up ruqyah; you could combine both types of     work if you think that is appropriate, without it affecting you or your     family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If treating the sick with ruqyah offers a good opportunity to     call them to Allaah, advise them and direct them towards what is good – as     you say – then you should not give up this work, even if other work becomes     available to you. This is a way of doing good to others. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The one who offers this treatment should remember that Allaah     is always watching him, in secret and in public, so he should be easy going     with people and not press them for payment or the cost of the treatment, and     he should remind them that healing is in the hand of Allaah alone. He should     remind them to repent to Allaah and give up the sins that lead to many     problems and calamities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

I had a brother who was called Abu ‘Umayr. He (the narrator) said: I think he said: He was a weanling. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and saw him, he said: “Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to the nughair (nightingale)?” He used to play with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It indicates that it is permissible for children to play with birds, and it is permissible to spend money on permissible things that will entertain children, and it is permissible to keep birds in cages and the like, and to clip the wings of birds, because one or the other must have been done in the case of Abu ‘Umair’s bird, and whichever is the case, the other comes under the same ruling.” (Fath al-Bari, 10/584)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Conditions_ofnbspkeeping_pets_in_Islamnbsp\">Conditions of&nbsp;keeping pets in Islam&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the conditions and guidelines on keeping animals, these include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. The animal that is kept should not be a dog, because <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69777\" target=\"_blank\">Islam has forbidden keeping dogs</a> except guard dogs and hunting dogs. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3225) and Muslim (2106). Would the Muslim be happy for the angels of mercy not to accompany him in his house because of an animal he is keeping?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Not going so far with regard to this matter that it reaches the stage of blameworthy extravagance. We have seen some people who pay thousands and even millions competing to buy a certain animal or take care of it and provide services for it. Some of them even bequeath some of their wealth to them. In some countries, there are festivals and shows for all kinds of animals, on which huge amounts of money are spent. All of this is foolishness and lack of common sense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. The animal must be treated kindly. If a Muslim keeps an animal, he must provide it with proper food and drink, and not cause it any harm or injury by mistreating it or using it for target practice or making animals fight one another, or exposing it to heat or cold. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst a man was walking on the road, he became very thirsty. He found a well so he went down into it and drank, then he came out. There he saw a dog that was panting and biting the ground out of thirst. The man said: this dog is feeling the same thirst that I felt. So he went back down into the well and filled his shoe with water, then he held it in his mouth until he climbed back up, and he gave the water to the dog. Allah appreciated (his action) and forgave him.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, will we have a reward with regard to these animals? He said: “In every living thing there is reward.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Look at how the believer will be rewarded for taking care of animals; rather he may even enter Paradise because of his kind treatment of a single animal, as happened to the man mentioned in this hadith. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, loves those who do good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us of a woman who went to Hell because of her neglect of a cat which she detained and it died of hunger; she did not feed it or let it go and eat of the vermin of the earth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3004\" target=\"_blank\">3004</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7004\" target=\"_blank\">7004</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22373\" target=\"_blank\">22373</a> ,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>What some people do, of standing in silence for a moment, as a salute to the martyrs or prominent figures, or to honour and show respect to their souls, and in mourning for them, is a reprehensible act and an innovation, that was not done at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or at the time of his Companions or the righteous earlier generations. It is not in accordance with the etiquette of Tawheed or sincere veneration towards Allah. Rather it is done by some Muslims who are ignorant of their religion, following the invention of this practice by the disbelievers, and imitating them in their reprehensible customs and their exaggeration about their leaders and prominent figures, both living and dead. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade us to imitate them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is customary in Islam is that the duty of the Muslim is to pray for their dead, to give charity on their behalf, to mention their good qualities and refrain from speaking of their bad qualities… And there is a great deal of etiquette that has been explained by Islam and that the Muslim is encouraged to pay attention to with regard to his brothers, both living and dead. However that does not include standing for a moment’s silence in honour of the martyrs or prominent figures; Rather this is something that is contrary to the principles of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength.

      "title": "She used to wipe over socks for varicose veins that do not cover the toes, as if wiping over khuffayn; what is the ruling on her prayer?",
      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>My mother is elderly and has varicose veins in her legs. For quite some time she has been wearing special stockings on her legs from halfway up the foot up to the knee; i.e., the end of the foot is uncovered. She says that when doing wudoo’, she did wudoo’ as usual, then when she reached the feet she wiped over the socks mentioned. She did that for a while until she stopped using the socks, and that was because it was too difficult to take them off and put them on again. She did not ask about the ruling at that time, because she thought that this was permissible so long as it was wiped.</div>\n<p>Now she is asking about the ruling on her prayers during this period?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to wiping over the khuffayn or socks, it is stipulated that the sock should cover the place that must be washed, and the place that must be washed goes from the ends of the toes to the ankles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to wipe over the khuffayn and the like if it covers the place that must be washed. If any part of the place that must be washed is not covered, then it is not permissible to wipe over it.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni, 1/183&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not allowed to wipe over the socks and so on unless the conditions stipulated in sharee‘ah are met, one of which is that the socks should cover the place that must be washed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 10/114&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The socks mentioned in the question do not come under the ruling on wiping over the khuffayn, because they do not cover the place that must be washed. But if the sick person needs to wear them and it is difficult for him to take them off every time he does wudoo’, then he may do wudoo’ before putting them on, and then put over them socks that cover properly. Then when he needs to do wudoo’, he can wipe over the socks that are covering them, until he takes them off or the period during which wiping over the socks is permissible ends. This is something acceptable and there is nothing wrong with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is not able to do that, and taking off the medical sock is something that will cause him harm or delay his recovery, then it comes under the same ruling as plaster casts; he may wipe over the entire thing, top and bottom – and this is one of the differences between wiping over plaster casts and wiping over the khuffayn: the entire cast should be wiped, whereas only the top of the khuffayn is wiped – and the uncovered part of the foot should be washed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114192\">114192</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What your mother should have done was ask about what was required in that situation. The fact that she did not ask indicates that she was careless; we ask Allah to forgive her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to making up the prayers that she offered in that situation, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning that. Some of the scholars say that the prayers must be made up and some say that it is not obligatory to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If she wants to be on the safe side and make up the prayers that she offered with that wudoo’, that will be better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is too difficult for her to do that or the days on which she offered prayers in that state were many, then she may be excused for not knowing, if she thought that what she was doing was correct and it did not occur to her to ask about it. In that case she does not have to repeat them according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45648\">45648</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on eating fruits picked from trees in the mosque or its gardens",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to pick fruits from the garden of the mosque in return for putting some money in the mosque collection box? Thank you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The majority of fuqaha’ are of the view that it is makrooh to     plant trees in the mosque, and some of them are of the view that it is     haraam, and some of them limited the prohibition to those that take up space     that should be for the worshippers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The reason why it is makrooh is that the mosque was not built     for that purpose, rather it was built for the remembrance of Allaah, prayer     and reading Qur'aan, and because the tree may damage the mosque and prevent     worshippers from praying in the spot where it is located, and its leaves and     fruits will fall in the mosque, and birds will come to it and defecate in     the mosque, and children may come to the mosque because of the tree and     throw stones at it to make its fruits fall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of them gave the reason for it being makrooh as being     because it is making the mosque similar to the synagogues of the Jews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not     permissible to plant a tree in the mosque. This was stated by Ahmad, who     said: If the date palm was planted after it became a mosque, then this was     planted unlawfully, and I would not like to eat from it. If the imam uproots     it, that is permissible, because the mosque was not built for that purpose,     rather it was built for the remembrance of Allaah, prayer and reading     Qur'aan, and because the tree may damage the mosque and prevent worshippers     from praying in the spot where it is located, and its leaves and fruits will     fall in the mosque, and birds will come to it and defecate in the mosque,     and children may come to the mosque because of the tree and throw stones at     it to make its fruits fall.. End quote from al-Mughni (5/370).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In al-Fataawa al-Hindyyah (1/110) it says: It is     makrooh to plant trees in the mosque, because that is making it like a     synagogue, and because it takes space away from the worshippers , unless it     will be of benefit to the mosque, such as if the land is wet and unstable     and the pillars would not be steady, so trees are planted therein to reduce     the instability. This is what it says in the Fataawa of Waadi Khaan.     End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn al-Humaam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not     permissible to plant trees in it unless the land is wet and unstable and the     pillars are not steady, in which case it is permissible in order to absorb     that water and bring about some benefit. End quote from Fath al-Qadeer     (1/421).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Zakariya al-Ansaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: And     it is makrooh (to dig a well or plant trees in it), rather if that causes     harm it is haraam (and the imam may remove it) lest it take space away from     the worshippers. Al-Adhra’i said that planting trees in a mosque that is     structurally sound is haraam because it takes space away from the     worshippers, and causes problems, and brings impurities from bird lime. And     he narrated from a number of the Iraqis that planting anything is not     allowed. End quote from Asna al-Mataalib (1/186).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Sharh al-Kharashi ‘ala Khaleel (7/48) it says:     Note: a number of scholars clearly stated that it is not allowed to plant     anything in the mosque. They said it is not permissible to dig therein or to     bury anyone therein. They said: Perhaps those who said it is makrooh meant     that it is makrooh in the sense of being haraam. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thus it is clear that the fuqaha’ said it is either haraam or     makrooh. This applies to things that are planted in the mosque after it is     built. But if there were any plants on the land before the mosque was built,     and the mosque is built around it, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said, in the passage quoted above: If there was     a date palm on the land, and its owner made it into a mosque and the date     palm is incorporated into it, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also seems that there is nothing wrong with there being     trees in a garden attached to the mosque, so long as they do not take away     any space from the worshippers and their leaves do not cause any problem for     the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to eating the fruits of these trees, that is     subject to further discussion. If the one who set up the waqf donated the     trees along with the mosque and specified on what the waqf was to be spent,     by stating that it is for the poor, or for imams or students or the mosque,     for example, then his request is to be followed. What has been donated as a     waqf to the mosque should be sold and spent on the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – If he did not specify how the waqf was to be spent, then     there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. It was said that     the ruling is the same as that for which the beneficiaries are not     stipulated, so it should be given to the heirs of the original donor as a     waqf for them, or it was said that it is permissible for the poor of the     mosque, or that it may be spent on the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – In the case of that which is planted in the mosque but     was not given as a waqf along with it, and which we have ruled to be makrooh     or haraam, if it was planted for the mosque then nothing should be taken     from it without paying something to the mosque in return. If it was planted     for the sake of Allaah or it is not known for what purpose it was planted,     it is permissible to eat from it, but it is better not to eat from it, but     if a person eats from it and donates something for the upkeep of the mosque     in return, there is no sin on him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There follow some comments of the fuqaha’ on this issue:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said in the same place as quoted above: If its     owner says: This is a waqf for the mosque, then its fruits should be sold     and the price donated to the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Safareeni (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Question:     Ruling on eating the fruits of trees belonging to the mosque. In     al-Furoo’, al-Insaaf, al-Iqnaa’, al-Muntaha, al-Ghaayah     and elsewhere, it says that if they are not removed, then their fruits are     for the poor of the mosque. It says in al-Insaaf: al-Haarithi said:     This is our view. He said: It is more likely that they are permissible for     other poor people too. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I     would not like to eat from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If it was planted before the mosque was built and was given     as a waqf along with it, then if (the donor) specified how (the fruits) were     to be disposed of, his wishes should be followed, otherwise it should be     given to the heirs of the donor, both rich and poor, as a waqf to them     according to their shares of inheritance. They are entitled to it as an     inheritance. If he has no relatives then it is for the poor and needy as a     waqf for them. al-Muwaffaq said: It is permissible to eat from it, and this     is the view of Imam Ahmad according to the report narrated by Abu Taalib.     ... A number of our companions said: It should be (sold and the money) spent     on the mosque, and if there is no need of it then its neighbour may eat the     fruits. He stated this in al-Faa’iq. But he stated the former view,     that if no particular recipient is stipulated then it is like a waqf for     which no recipient were stipulated, in al-Iqnaa’, al-Muntaha     and al-Ghaayah. (2/317).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Haashiyat al-Bujayrimi (3/103) it says: It is     makrooh to plant trees in the mosque as it says in al-Rawdah. I say: This is     to be understood as meaning that it is makrooh if it does not affect the     mosque or the worshippers, otherwise it is haraam and if it has been planted     it should be uprooted. The one who should uproot it is the imam or his     deputy, not individuals, whether it was haraam or makrooh to plant it,     because he has the right to remove makrooh things. But it is not permissible     to cut down that which was planted for the mosque and is not causing any     harm, because it belongs to the mosque. This was stated by al-Qaadi. But it     should be limited to that which bears fruits from which the mosque may     benefit, otherwise it should be removed. The basic principle dictates that     attention should be paid to whichever serves the greater interest: leaving     it or removing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of things that were planted for the mosque but     deserve to be removed, it is not permissible to eat their fruits unless one     makes a donation to the mosque in return. If they were planted to provide     food for the sake of Allaah or the intention of the one who planted them is     unknown, it is permissible to eat from them without paying anything in     return. The same applies to the fruits of trees planted for the sake of     Allaah in the graveyard or if the intention of the one who planted it is not     known, and the same applies to plants that grew there by themselves. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said: Abu’l-Khattaab said: In my view, if the     mosque needs the price of the fruits of the trees, they may be sold and the     price given towards upkeep of the mosque. He said: Ahmad’s view is that the     neighbours may eat them, which may be understood as meaning that they attend     the mosque and take care of it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this, if the fruits of the garden asked about here     were donated as a waqf for a specific cause, then it is not permissible for     anyone but the specified recipients to eat from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If they were planted for the sake of Allaah, it is     permissible to eat from them without paying anything in return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If they were given as a waqf or planted for the benefit of     the mosque, then they should be sold and the money spent on the mosque. If a     person takes some of them and puts some money in the mosque collection box     in return, then he has done the right thing. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on tethering animals and detaining them in order to feed them and fatten them",
      "question": "<p>We work with livestock, fattening bulls. If we leave the bulls in the field to walk and play, then no matter what we feed them they will not grow as fat as bulls that are tethered. Personally, I do not tether the bull because I feel sorry for it, and because I regard that as torturing the animal. As for my relatives, all of them tether the livestock, and they laugh at me and say: Why are you so emotional and forbid what Allah has permitted? If that was prohibited, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have forbidden it. So what is the ruling on tethering bulls to fatten them for 5 or 6 [days] or more, so that a single bull will be 90 centimetres or less, and that the animal cannot scratch itself or drive away flies from itself, and for all that time it cannot move. It is for this reason that sometimes its legs become swollen.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to torture or harm animals, such as detaining them and not feeding them, or hitting them unnecessarily, or branding them on the face, because of the prohibition in the religious texts on doing such things, as in the hadith of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat that she detained, and did not feed it or let it loose to eat from the vermin of the earth, until it died.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3140; Muslim, 2242.</p>\n<p>According to a version narrated by al-Bukhari: “A woman was punished because of a cat that she detained until it died of hunger, and she entered Hell because of it.” And he said: “Allah knows best. Allah said (to the woman): You gave it neither food nor water when you detained it, and you did not let it loose to eat from the vermin of the earth.”</p>\n<p>What is meant by the vermin of the earth is insects and pests.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah have mercy on him) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he forbade capturing any animal for the purpose of killing it (for sport). Narrated by Muslim (1959).</p>\n<p>What is meant by killing it for sport is detaining it until it dies or shooting it with arrows and the like.</p>\n<p>It was also narrated from him (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade striking on the face or branding on the face. Narrated by Muslim, 2116.</p>\n<p>And it was narrated from him (may Allah be pleased with him) that a donkey that had been branded on the face passed by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: “May Allah curse the one who branded him.” Narrated by Muslim, 2117.</p>\n<p>From the hadith about the cat, it may be understood that if animals are detained and fed, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>Al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From this it is understood that simply tying up an animal that is owned by someone is not prohibited, because condemnation only applies to not feeding animals or letting them loose to find food themselves.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is prohibited to kill cats and it is prohibited to detain them without giving them food or drink.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Tarh at-Tathrib</em>, 8/243.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From this hadith it is understood that if animals are given sufficient food and drink, then there is nothing wrong with [detaining them].</p>\n<p>That includes birds that are kept in cages, if they are given food and drink in sufficient amounts, and they are protected from heat and cold, then there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>But if they are not given sufficient food and drink, and they die because of that, then the person who does that will be punished for it.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Sharh Riyad as-Salihin</em>, 6/293.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with tethering animals if they are fed, and tethering them is not regarded as torturing them. The Muslims have always tethered their animals in order to protect them and for other reasons without anyone criticizing them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) tethered Buraq, as Muslim (162) narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Buraq – which is a tall white beast, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule, whose stride reaches as far as he can see – was brought to me and I rode it until I reached Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets, and I entered the mosque.”</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (2517) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: A man said: O Messenger of Allah, should I hobble it [my camel] and put my trust in Allah, or should I let it loose and put my trust in Allah? He said: “Hobble it and put your trust in Allah.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Mukhtar as-Sihah</em>, p. 215:&nbsp; What is meant by hobbling the camel is tying up one of its forelegs with a rope [so that it cannot stray]. End quote.</p>\n<p>This indicates that it is permissible to tether animals.</p>\n<p>This tethering does not harm the animal and does not prevent it from driving off flies or scratching its skin, because it drives away flies with its tail and it scratches its skin on the walls and the like that are around it.</p>\n<p>But if we assume that someone ties the rope on the animal too tightly when tethering it, to the extent that he harms it, then he should be advised to loosen the rope a little, and to avoid harming and hurting the animal as much as possible.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Their mother prevented them from taking their share of their father’s estate, and issues concerning the fairness of giving (to one’s children)",
      "question": "<p>A man died and left behind a wife and three sons (two of them are under 21 meaning underage), and two daughters, one of them was married before the father died. The other daughter and one of the sons have finished their education and are working now, while the other two sons are still having their education.  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother was working with the father. And they used to save their salaries together, and she approved to this of course (she used to say to him: “what matters is that I take the bonus of retiring, and this is what already happened) while the husband takes what they both save and buy properties in his name. <br />\n<br />\nThe questions: <br />\n<br />\nWhen the heirs divide the heritage, should they count the mother’s salaries and discount it from the entire heritage, then divide what remains on all of them (mother, two daughters and three sons)? The mother says that the heritage will not be divided before every one finishes his education and gets married. Then the heritage will be divided according to the Islamic Sharia, boy’s share is double the girl’s one. Is this permissible? When should the heritage be divided according to Sharia?  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother does not want anyone of the children to know how much the heritage exactly is so that no one says I should take more than my share when time of dividing comes. Is that permissible?  <br />\nBefore the father died he bought a car and wrote it in his oldest son’s name according to his wife’s wish. As this son’s position allows him to easily return the licence if it was taken for some reason. The father had the intention to buy a car for every one of his children for the same price, and to buy a car for half of that price for the unmarried daughter. He paid more than half the price of it already before he died. He had the intention to give the married daughter as much as he would give the unmarried one as well.  <br />\n<br />\nAfter the father died the mother said: “the car is for the eldest son, his father bought it for him because he is obedient, and the father is free to give whoever he wills of his children from his own money, as long as the son is obedient” and as for the car of the unmarried daughter, the mother reclaimed the money as she cannot continue paying the other half, because if she withdraws money from the bank, the whole heritage will be transferred to the “welfare trust”, which will keep the shares of the underage children aside. She will not then be able to do anything about the underage children’s shares except via the welfare trust. Is that permissible?  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother’s reasons for not dividing the heritage are, as I said, the welfare trust. She says about the underage children: “is it fair that I spend on them until they grow up and after that they take their whole shares regardless what I spent on them of my own money?  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother asked her three older children to grant her power of attorney that allows her to have full control of the heritage. She will also ask the underage children to do the same when they reach the legal age for this. What is the ruling of every point of the above mentioned? <br />\n<br />\nMay Allah reward you and accept your deeds purely for His sake. Sorry for the long inquiry.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The basic     principle concerning the wife’s wealth is that it belongs to her and it is     not permissible for her husband to take it or to take any part of it without     her consent. Allaah has forbidden consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, but     He has given permission to the husband to take some of his wife’s wealth if     she gives it up willingly, with no force or compulsion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who     believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a     trade amongst you, by mutual consent”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’     4:29]</p>\n<p>    “And give     to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by     the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart; but if     they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and     enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’     4:4]</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a wife     gives her salary to her husband willingly, then it is a donation from her     which becomes his property when he takes possession of it. Based on this, no     attention should be paid to the previous salaries of the mother which she     gave to her husband, because they were not a loan which she can ask to be     repaid from the estate.</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    When a person     dies, his wealth passes directly to his heirs straight after his death, and     it is not permissible for anyone to conceal the estate from the heirs or for     anyone to prevent division of the estate. If the heirs agree not to divide     all or some of the inheritance, there is nothing wrong with that. If one of     them wants his share, then he must be given his share of the inheritance,     either by selling property and giving him his share, or by one or all of the     heirs buying his share, so they give him the price of his share of the     inheritance, without any wrongdoing or unfairness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the     answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/4089\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">4089</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What the     father and mother must do is treat their children equally with regard to     giving. It is not permissible for them to favour one of them over another,     even if the one who is favoured is dutiful towards his parents. But they may     show favour to one of the children if there is a legitimate shar’i reason     for doing so, such as if he has a large family and cannot spend on them, or     he is disabled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This has been     discussed in the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/36872\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">36872</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If one of the     parents gave a gift to one of the children and not the others, then they     must take it back and the child must return it and not accept it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From this is     it known that it is not permissible to accept the car which the father     bought for his son. The claim that the son needed the car could have been     dealt with by the father buying a car for his son to drive but not own, so     it would have belonged to the father, then when the father died it would     become part of the estate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So the son has     no choice but to put the car that his father bought for him with the estate,     or to work out its value and keep it, and deduct its value&nbsp; from his share     of the estate, and if the other heirs agree to let him have it, it will     become his.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh     Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said     concerning a similar case:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to     what the brother who asked the question said about the father giving his son     some land … it is not permissible for him to give land to him and not to his     brothers. If we assume that he gave it to him, then he must during his     lifetime give the others something similar to what he gave him, or else take     the land back so that it will be among the property that is inherited after     he dies. If he dies before that, if the children agree to this gift, then it     is valid, just as if they agree to it whilst he is still alive. But if they     do not agree to it, then it should be put back with the estate and inherited     along with the rest of his wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Liqaa’aat     al-Baab il-Maftooh     (39.question no. 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning a case where one of a person’s     sons needed a car:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He may buy a     car for the son to use, but it should remain the property of the father,     because the son only needs to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also     Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (73/question no. 27)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fifthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The parents     must also be fair with regard to the kind of spending that is done for a     reason, if that reason arises again with other children. So if he arranges a     marriage for one of his sons, he must also arrange marriages for his other     children if they need to get married and the parents can afford to get them     married. It is not essential that they spend the same amount on the     weddings. The marriage of one of them may not cost the same as the marriage     of another. So it is not permissible for the parents who have arranged a     marriage for one of their children to give a similar amount of money to the     rest of their children, and after the father dies it is not permissible to     take this money from the estate and give it to the children who did not get     married whilst their father was still alive, unless the other heirs agree to     that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we have     said about marriage applies also to medical treatment, education and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh     Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The basic     principle is that it is not permissible for the father to give anything to     any of his sons or daughters unless he gives something similar to the     others, because Basheer ibn Sa’d al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him)     gave his son al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer a gift, and he came to the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ask him to bear witness to     the gift that he gave to his son. He said to him: “Do you have other sons?”     He said: Yes. He said: “Have you given them a similar gift?” He said: No.     The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fear     Allaah and treat your children fairly.” And he also said: “Let someone else     bear witness to this, for I will not bear witness to injustice.” So it is     not permissible for the father to single out one of his children, whether     sons or daughters, for something unless he gives something similar to the     others, or if they agree to that willingly and by their own choice, and they     are mature and of sound mind. In that case there is nothing wrong with it.     Otherwise, if the gift is to meet some need of maintenance or a need for     marriage, such as if one of them is independent of means and does not need     his father to spend on him, but another is poor and needs his father to     spend on him, and he spends on this poor one as much as is needed, then that     is permissible, even if he does not give anything to the other one who is     independent of means. Similarly, if one of his sons needs to get married and     he arranges his marriage, then he does not have to give the others the same     as he gives to this son for his marriage, but when the others reach the age     of marriage and want to get married, he has to arrange their marriages as he     did for the first one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I would like     to take this opportunity to speak of something that some people do, which is     when a man has children who have reached the age of marriage, he arranges     their marriages, and he has other children who are still small and have not     yet reached the age of marriage. So he leaves a will leaving them after his     death the same amount as he gave to their brothers. This bequest is haraam     and is invalid, because the reason for arranging the marriages of the older     ones was to meet a need, and the younger ones had not yet reached an age     where they needed to get married. If he leaves a will giving them something     like that which he spent to marry off the others, that is haraam and is     invalid, and the will should not be executed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Liqaa’aat     al-Baab il-Mahtooh     (39/question no. 1)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he said     (may Allaah have mercy on him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a man     arranges marriages for his adult sons it is not permissible for him to     bequeath the mahr to his younger sons, but when one of his sons reaches the     age of marriage he must arrange his marriage as he did for the first one.     But if he bequeaths it to him after he dies, this is haraam. The evidence     for that is the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him): “Allaah has given each person his rights and no will can be made     in favour of an heir.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’     Fataawa al-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen     (18/question no. 296).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this,     what the mother says about delaying the division of the estate until the     rest of her children are married and have finished their studies is wrong     and it is not permissible for her to do it or for her children to accept     it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sixthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The children     do not have to make their mother their agent in the disposal of the estate     because she owns nothing but her own share. If they want to appoint her in     charge of their shares, then they may do that. We have stated that it is not     permissible for the mother to take control of the estate or her children’s     shares, rather she must allow it to be divided in accordance with sharee’ah     if the children ask for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for     spending on the children, the mother is not obliged to spend on them unless     they do not have any wealth and she is able to spend on them. But if they     possess wealth then their maintenance should come from their own wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah     knows best.</p>\n",

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“If one of you sees something with his brother that he admires, let him pray for blessing (<em>barakah</em>) for him.” Narrated by Imam Malik in&nbsp;<em>al-Muwatta</em>&nbsp;(2/939), Imam Ahmad in&nbsp;<em>al-Musnad</em>&nbsp;(25/355), and Ibn Majah (3509)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Should_you_repeat_the_dursquoa\">Should you repeat the du’a?</span></h3>\n<p>The scholars differed as to whether this command means that this should be repeated or not.</p>\n<p>According to Usul al-Fiqh, if there is a command to do something with no indication to suggest that it should be done repeatedly, then it does not have to be done repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to the report narrated by Muslim in his&nbsp;<em>Sahih</em>&nbsp;from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressed us and said: “O people, Allah has made Hajj obligatory for you, so do Hajj.” A man said: Is it every year, O Messenger of Allah? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) remained silent until the man said it three times. Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I said yes, it would become obligatory and you would not be able to do it.” Then he said: “Leave me so long as I have left you, for those who came before you were only doomed because of their asking too many questions and differing with their Prophets. If I instruct you to do something, then do as much of it as you can, and if I forbid you to do something, then do not do it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The relevant point in this hadith is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “O people, Allah has made Hajj obligatory for you, so do Hajj.” Similar reports were narrated by Imam Ahmad and an-Nasai. This hadith is quoted as evidence to indicate that a command with nothing to suggest that it should be repeated means that it does not have to be repeated, according to the books of Usul al-Fiqh.” (<em>Adwa al-Bayan, </em>5/74)</p>\n<p>But if there is something to indicate that it should be repeated, then it must be repeated, based on this corroborating evidence. An example of that is if a command to do something is connected to a condition or cause that makes it required to do it. In that case, what is appropriate to the wisdom of the Lawgiver is to repeat the enjoined action every time the reason for which it was prescribed recurs.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Lahham (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“With regard to the Lawgiver, He is most Wise and it is not possible for there to be any contradiction in His commands. Therefore if He prescribes a ruling and gives the reason for it, we know that He has prescribed that ruling to be done every time that reason recurs. And Allah knows best.” <em>(Al-Qawa‘id wa’l-Fawaid al-Usuliyyah, </em>p. 240)</p>\n<p>The hadith quoted above mentions admiration as the reason for praying for barakah; this indicates that the supplication should be repeated every time one sees something that he admires.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_it_a_sin_if_you_donrsquot_say_it\">Is it a sin if you don’t say it?</span></h3>\n<p>As for not praying for barakah, what appears to be the case is that there must be one of two scenarios with regard to the seer (looker):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first scenario: the seer admires it greatly, to the extent that he fears that he could harm his brother with the evil eye. In this case it is obligatory for him to pray for barakah, because the Muslim is required to ward off evil and harm from his brothers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“If the one who is looking fears that he could cause harm by his <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11359\" target=\"_blank\">evil eye</a> to the object that he is looking at, then he may ward off its evil by saying “<em>Allahumma barik ‘alayhi</em>&nbsp;(O Allah, bless it for him),” as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Amir ibn Rabi‘ah, when he looked at Sahl ibn Hunayf: “Did you not pray for barakah for him?” – In other words did you not say &nbsp;“<em>Allahumma barik ‘alayhi</em>&nbsp;(O Allah, bless it for him)”?” (<em>Zad al-Ma‘ad</em>, 4/156)</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah be pleased with him) stated that this is obligatory, when he said:</p>\n<p>“The words of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Did you not pray for barakah for him?”, indicate that the evil eye does not cause any harm if the one who looks at a thing prays for barakah for it; it can only cause harm if he does not offer supplication. So what is required of everyone who admires a thing is to pray for barakah for it. If he prays for barakah, that will inevitably ward off what is feared of harm. And Allah knows best.” (<em>At-Tamhid, </em>6/240-241)</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) followed him in that in&nbsp;<em>at-Tafsir</em>&nbsp;(11/401), and it was quoted from him by Ibn al-Mulaqqin in&nbsp;<em>at-Tawdih</em>&nbsp;(27/401).</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"2\">The second scenario: If he is not known to have an <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20954\" target=\"_blank\">evil eye</a> and he does not fear that he could cause harm, and he is not worried about harming his brother with his <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/89604\" target=\"_blank\">evil eye</a> , then in this case it is still prescribed to pray for barakah, because that is part of showing kindness to his brothers, although we have not come across anyone who says that it is obligatory in such a situation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/299965\" target=\"_blank\">299965</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7747\" target=\"_blank\">7747</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/33663\" target=\"_blank\">33663</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>In the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/102843\">102843</a> we stated that seeking the help of the jinn is prohibited according to Islamic teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By the same token, it is not permissible to call upon the angels, seek their help or ask them to meet one’s needs instead of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; rather that comes under the heading of shirk (associating others with Allah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever regards the angels and Prophets as intermediaries, calling upon them, putting his trust in them and asking them to bring benefits and ward off harm is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/124)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee said:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to use the jinn in any manner whatsoever, because that comes under the heading of seeking the help of the jinn and devils, which is haraam and is one of the means that lead to shirk. It is also not permissible to believe in anything that the practitioners of witchcraft say, because of the evil consequences to which that leads.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/102)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seeking help from the jinn or angels, or seeking their aid to bring benefit or ward off harm, or to protect oneself from the evil of the jinn, is all major shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam – Allah forbid – regardless of whether that is done by means of calling them, writing their names and wearing it as an amulet, or washing (that writing) and drinking the water, and so on, if one believes that the amulet or the water – and not Allah – will bring benefit or ward off harm.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/134-135)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another of the tricks that the Shaytaan uses against people is to make a person thinks that if he seeks the help of the angels, calls upon them, and asks them for what he needs, then if he is helped and his needs are met, he thinks that it is the angels who helped him. This is one of the tricks and plots of the Shaytaan, for the angels do not help anyone to associate others with Allah. Rather it is his shaytaan who has helped him, in order to confuse him about his religion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up: it is not permissible to seek the help of the angels or the jinn, whether to fly or to do anything else. Rather in all his affairs the individual should seek the help of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If you seek help, then seek help from Allah.” Narrated by Ahmad (2664); narrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (2516); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But with regard to physical, tangible matters, there is nothing wrong with seeking them from a person who owns them or has control over them, or seeking his help with regard to that. In that case this person is one of a number of means and measures that the accountable person may take.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to seek the help of the jinn or those who are absent, because this comes under the heading of associating others with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Seeking help is an act of worship and it is not permissible to direct it to anyone other than Allah, whether that is a jinn or a human or an angel or anything else, except in the case of a living human being who is present and is able to do something, such as seeking the help of a living and capable human being to cultivate land, build structures and fight enemies. But in the case of the jinn, the ruling on those who are present is the same as the ruling on those who are absent: it is not permissible to seek their help in anything whatsoever, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [al-Faatihah 1:5]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you seek help, then seek the help of Allah.”</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/198)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the possibility of flying by seeking the help of the jinn, this is possible in and of itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The jinn still carry people and fly with them from one place to another.</p>\n<p>End quote from an-Nubuwwaat (2/804)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those whom the jinn carry and fly with them from one place to another, in most cases they do not know how they are carried].</p>\n<p>End quote from an-Nubuwwaat (2/998)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But not everything that is possible is acceptable in Islam. Most sins, such as associating others with Allah, stealing, zina, murder, and so on are things that it is possible for people to do, but the fact that something is possible on its own is not sufficient to indicate that something is acceptable or permissible. Rather what is acceptable or permissible or prohibited is in accordance with what Allah has prescribed for His slaves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/124838\">124838</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

So you have to go back to the Sacred Mosque and     circumambulate the Ka’bah seven times, starting each circuit from the Black     Stone and ending the seventh circuit at the Black Stone, and each circuit     must go outside Hijr Ismaa’eel from behind the wall. Thus your Hajj will     become acceptable. But if the tawaaf in question was the farewell tawaaf,     then you have to offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah and given to     the poor, in order to complete your Hajj, but you do not have to go back to     the Ka’bah, and if you do go back it will not waive the obligation to offer     a sacrifice.

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for the husband to forsake his wife for no legitimate shar‘i reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The legitimate shar‘i reasons for forsaking include: wilful defiance (nushooz) on the part of the wife and looking down at her husband, and disobedience towards his commands. In that case it is prescribed to admonish her, then to forsake her, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great”</p>\n<p>[An-Nisa’ 4:34].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This forsaking has to do with the physical relationship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to not speaking to her, it is not permissible for him to forsake her for more than three days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (20/261), concerning a man who forsook his wife for more than three months:</p>\n<p>Whoever forsakes his wife for more than three months, if that is because of wilful defiance and ill conduct on her part, i.e., she disobeyed her husband with regard to what she is obliged to fulfil of marital duties towards him, and persisted in that after he admonished her and reminded her to fear Allah, may He be exalted, and reminded her of the duties that she owes to her husband, then he may forsake her in bed for as long as he wants, in order to discipline her so that she will fulfil her duties towards her husband willingly. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) shunned his wives, and stayed away from them for a month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But with regard to not speaking, it is not permissible for him to forsake or shun her in that sense for more than three days, because of the saheeh report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the hadith of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his brother (fellow Muslim) for more than three days.” Narrated by Imam al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their Saheehs and by Ahmad in his Musnad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh, Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you were not wilfully disobedient (nushooz), then his shunning you is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What the husband must do is share his time equitably between both wives. If he gets angry with one wife, he does not have the right to spend the night with the other; rather he must spend the night with her, even if he shuns her in bed, if doing so is justified, because of what is confirmed of the command to treat co-wives fairly, and because of the prohibition on shunning by staying out of the house.</p>\n<p>Ibn Maajah (1850) narrated from Hakeem ibn Mu‘aawiyah, from his father, that a man asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): What are the rights of the woman over her husband? He said, “That he should feed her as he feeds himself and clothe her as he clothes himself; he should not strike her on the face or curse her, and he should not forsake her except in the house (as a form of discipline).”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The view of our companions is: the man is obliged to stay in his wife’s house one night out of four. This staying overnight guarantees two things: firstly that they will come together in the house and secondly that they will come together in the bed. The words of Allah, may He be exalted, “refuse to share their beds” along with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “forsaking should only be in the sense of refraining from intimacy” indicate that it is obligatory to spend the night in the same house, even when refusing to share the bed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad stated concerning the one who fasts by day and prays qiyaam at night: This indicates that it is obligatory to spend the night with his wife and share her bed, and in the case of wilful defiance (nushooz), he may keep away from intimacy with her, but he should not go further than that.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mustadrak ‘ala Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/217)</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we assume that your husband wanted to punish you for saying that you were going to sleep with the sisters, then all that he can do is forsake you after admonishing you, and we have stated above that forsaking can only be by refraining from intimacy whilst still spending the night in your house. Based on that, your husband made a mistake by leaving you in the house and spending the night with his other wife.</p>\n<p>If it was not the matter of a punishment; rather he thought that you wanted to spend the night with the sisters, which would mean that he did not have to&nbsp; spend the night with you, then he should have listened to you when you said that that was not the case, and he should have given you your rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The husband has to make up the nights that he missed with his wife for no good reason. So he should stay overnight with her for the number of nights that he missed, and then go back to dividing his time between both wives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If he leaves the house during the time that is allocated to one of his wives, if that was during the day, or at the beginning of the night, or at the end of the night when people usually get up and go out to the prayer, then that is permissible, because the Muslims go out for ‘Isha’ prayer and for Fajr prayer before dawn breaks, and during the day they go out to earn a livelihood and do errands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he goes out at other times, but is not out for long before he comes back, then he does not have to make it up to her, because there is no benefit in making that up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he stays out, then he should make it up to her, regardless of whether he stayed out for a valid reason, such as work or being detained or some other valid reason, because she missed out on her rights due to his absence from her.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni (8/145)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice is to resolve the problems in an atmosphere of love and harmony, paying attention to people’s rights, but if you give up your right concerning the days when he was angry with you, that will be better for you and your husband. You should forgive one another and communicate with one another, especially since some of the scholars think that the right of the wife who was wronged has already been missed and the husband does not have to make it up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also question&nbsp;no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/ar/answers/166912\" target=\"_blank\">166912</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Using a credit card with the intention of not delaying payment",
      "question": "<p>I live in occupied Jerusalem, Palestine. As you know there are no Islamic banks here, all banks deal with interest. What is the ruling on using the credit cards of these banks, knowing that if I delay paying in a specific date I will have to pay the interest to the bank? But I will never delay paying in order to avoid paying the interest. I know that this card is considered a Riba contract. And that what is built on wrong will remain wrong, but I do not take or pay interest. <br />\n<br />\nI intend to use it as I cannot afford some very expensive things at once, only by installments. I do not know if the things I want to buy are necessary in the Sharia’s point of view, but I am in need of them as soon as possible. I do not want to follow my desire and deviate from the right. Note that I pay a fixed monthly amount for this credit card service regardless how many times I used it.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is not     permissible to use credit cards that stipulate payment of interest even if a     person intends to pay it off on time, because it is not permissible to     approve of riba or enter a contract that includes it. And because a person     may fall into riba as the result of delaying payments due to forgetting,     travelling and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn     ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: The banks give their     customers a credit card called Visa which enables the customer to withdraw     money from his account even if there is no money in his account at that     moment, on condition that he pay the bank back within a certain amount of     time. If he does not pay it back within that time limit, then the bank will     ask for more than the customer withdrew. Please note that the customer will     pay a set amount to the bank in return for using this card. I hope that you     can explain the ruling on using this card.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:     This transaction is haraam, because the one who enters it is committing to     paying riba if he does not pay off within the time limit, and this is a     invalid commitment, even if a person believes or thinks it most likely that     he will pay it off in full before the time limit ends, because circumstances     may change and he may not be able to pay it off. This has to do with the     future and no one knows what will happen to him in the future. Such     transactions are haraam. And Allaah knows best.

Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><em>{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you, that you may become righteous}&nbsp;[al-Baqarah 2:183]</em>.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, giving zakah, Hajj and fasting Ramadan.”</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/232694\" target=\"_blank\">The one who does not fast has failed to observe one of the pillars of Islam</a> and has committed a grave major sin. In fact, some of the early generations were of the view that he is a disbeliever and apostate– we seek refuge with Allah from that.</p>\n<p>Abu Ya‘la narrated in his Musnad from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The bonds of Islam and the foundations of the faith are three, on which Islam is based. Whoever fails to do one of them becomes a disbeliever thereby and may be executed [for apostasy…this would be in an Islamic state and there would be due process]: testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, offering the prescribed prayers, and fasting in Ramadan.</p>\n<p>This hadith was classed as sahih by adh-Dhahabi; it was classed as hasan by al-Haythami in <em>Majma‘ az-Zawaid</em> (1/48) and al-Mundhiri in <em>at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib</em>, no. 805, 1486; it was classed as da‘if (weak) by al-Albani in <em>as-Silsilah ad-Da‘ifah</em>, no. 94.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi said in <em>al-Kabair</em>, p. 64: Among the believers it is established that whoever fails to fast the month of Ramadan, without being sick and without any excuse that would make that permissible, is worse than the zani and the one who is addicted to alcohol. In fact, they doubted whether he was a Muslim, and thought that he was a heretic. End quote.</p>\n<p>What has been soundly narrated of warnings against failing to fast is that which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibban (7491) from Abu Umamah al-Bahili, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:</p>\n<p>Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: ‘Climb up.’ I said: ‘I cannot do it.’ They said: ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: ‘What are these voices?’ They said: ‘This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: ‘Who are these?’ They said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so.’” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Mawarid al-Zam‘an, 1509.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then deliberately broke his fast before the time for iftar had come. So how about one who does not fast at all? We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_kind_of_sickness_makes_it_permissible_to_break_the_fast\">What kind of sickness makes it permissible to break the fast?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12488\" target=\"_blank\">The kind of sickness that makes it permissible to break the fast </a> is sickness that will cause real hardship to the one who fasts.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi said in <em>al-Majmu‘</em> (6/261):</p>\n<p>The sick person who is unable to fast because of a sickness from which there is hope of recovery is not obliged to fast.… This applies if he will suffer real hardship when fasting. It is not stipulated that he should have reached the state in which he is unable to fast at all. Rather our companions said: For it to be permissible not to fast, it is stipulated that fasting should cause significant hardship that makes it difficult to fast. End quote.</p>\n<p>And he said:</p>\n<p>With regard to mild sickness that does not cause real hardship, it is not permissible for him not to fast, and there is no difference of opinion among us concerning that.\" (A<em>l-Majmu‘</em>&nbsp; 6/261).</p>\n<p>If your wife who is a new Muslim will not face hardship if she fasts, then it is not permissible for her not to fast. You must explain that to her, and tell her that not fasting is a major sin. She should consult a doctor about the sleep issues and anxiety, and there is nothing wrong with taking medicine for that, if necessary. Whatever she needs of medicine to help her sleep or deal with anxiety, and the like, can be taken at night, so long as that is possible, so that she can maintain her fast and not transgress the sanctity of the month just because of anxiety or anxious thoughts.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The second witness was not present when the marriage contract was done; is his marriage valid?",
      "question": "<p>I have got married, praise be to Allah, but there is something that is worrying me. When I did the marriage contract I did it in the courtroom (in Syria) and I asked about the official (who conducted the marriage), and I was told that he was a Muslim who prayed, but he was clean shaven. The problem is that when the marriage contract was done, there was no one there except one witness, who is my paternal uncle, my father's brother, who witnessed the marriage contract. The other witness was a Muslim lawyer, who came in and signed the documents and left, and he did not stay to witness and hear the proposal and acceptance. Is this marriage contract done in this manner valid, or is it essential for the witness to hear the proposal and acceptance?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The purpose behind having witnesses when the marriage contract is done is so that her the proposal from the woman's wali (guardian) or from the one who is acting in his stead, such as a wakeel (deputy or proxy), will be heard, and the acceptance from her husband or one who is acting in his stead, will be heard too. If the proposal and acceptance are written down and the witness's is deaf, for example, and he witnessed what was written during the marriage contract, then his testimony is valid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly” [al-Zukhruf 43:86]. If the knowledge of what is happening reaches the witness, that is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti‘, 5/162&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that announcing and publicising the marriage and informing the people of it is sufficient and there is no need for special witnesses; rather it is stronger than that. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars said that it is stipulated that the marriage should either be witnessed or announced, i.e., proclaimed openly, and that if it is announced, that is sufficient, because it is furthest removed from any doubt.&nbsp; There are some reservations about not having the marriage witnessed is risky, because a man may commit zina with a woman, then if she gets pregnant from him, he will claim that he married her, when that is not the case. So having the marriage witnessed is stipulated for this reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if it is announced, then this reservation no longer applies, because it is stronger than just having it witnessed. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), as he stipulated either having the marriage witnessed or announcing it. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If there are witnesses but the marriage is not announced, then there is some doubt as to whether the marriage contract is valid, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined that marriages be announced, and said: “Proclaim the wedding.” And because there is the fear that secret marriage will lead to negative consequences, even if it is witnessed, because a man may commit zina - Allah forbid - with a woman then say: ‘I married her,’ then he summons two false witnesses and they give their (false) testimony. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti‘, 5/160&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This proves that announcing the marriage is stronger than only having the marriage contract witnessed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) summed up the issue of having the marriage witnessed and announcing it by saying: There is no doubt that doing the marriage contract along with announcing the marriage is valid, even if it is not witnessed by two witnesses, but if it is concealed and witnessed, this is something concerning which there is some doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is both witnessed and announced, there is no doubt as to its validity in this case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is neither witnessed nor announced, then it is invalid according to all scholars, and if there is any difference of opinion, it is very little.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 177&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words ‘There is no doubt that doing the marriage contract along with announcing the marriage is valid, even if it is not witnessed by two witnesses’ indicate that there is no need to worry about what you mentioned. Even if we assume that the witnessing was not valid, announcing the marriage is sufficient in sha Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But it should be noted that the word witness does not apply only to the one who signs the marriage&nbsp; contract; rather it refers to everyone who is present when the marriage contract is done, such as the scribe, relatives, the official and others. They are all witnesses to it, if they are fit to be witnesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Eating seven dates in the morning and the impact of believing in that on the healing effect",
      "question": "<p>I have Qs regarding eating dates and magic. Can one eat 'any' dates in 7, or they must be ajwa? And if only ajwa, then must they only be ajwa from Al-'Aliya? And do they benefit before magic is spelled on someone or after it is spelled and one is afflicted with sihr? Or both, before and after? Before, they are like shield from sihr? And after, they have healing effect?</p>\n<p>And do they benefit only someone who believes in these ahaadeeth? Or anyone? i mean, a Muslim only? .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (5445) and Muslim (2047) narrated from Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats seven ‘ajwah dates in the morning, will not be harmed by any poison or witchcraft that day.”</p>\n<p>Most of the scholars are of the view that this applies only to the dates of Madinah, and specifically to a particular type of the dates of Madinah, namely ‘ajwah dates, which grow in ‘Aaliyat al-Madinah. This is most likely to be correct, and it is the apparent meaning of the hadith.</p>\n<p>Some scholars are of the view that it is general in meaning, and that all types of dates are efficacious against poison and witchcraft. Among those who were of this view among contemporary scholars are Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them). This has been discussed previously in question no. 205041.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that the hadith applies specifically to the people of Madinah and those in the vicinity, because of their physical makeup which is accustomed to that environment.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This hadith is addressed to a specific audience, such as the people of Madinah and those in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>End quote from Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/90).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The hadith clearly states that eating dates in the morning is efficacious in warding off witchcraft before it occurs, but it is not far-fetched to suggest that they would also have the effect of removing it after it occurred, especially since it is well-known that witchcraft may be undone by means of treatment with remedies and ruqyah as prescribed in sharee‘ah, so the sorcerer would have to repeat the spell that he cast on that person. For that reason, the sick person should persist in eating seven dates every morning until he is fully recovered and so that he may be safe in the future – by Allah’s leave – from the harm of sorcerers and devils.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>The one who acts in accordance with these hadiths may find the effect of protection against poison and witchcraft, even if he does not believe in it, as it says in the story of the one who was stung by a scorpion [who was a disbeliever], who was treated with ruqyah by reciting Soorat al-Faatihah over him.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This hadith refers to achieving healing by reciting al-Faatihah over the person who had been stung, so that he no longer needed regular medicine, and perhaps it healed him far better than regular medicine could have done, even though the recipient of the treatment was not the best candidate, either because the people of this tribe were not Muslim or because they were miserly and mean people. So how about if he had been a good candidate for such treatment?</p>\n<p>End quote from Madaarij as-Saalikeen (1/79).</p>\n<p>But having faith in the remedy will make it more effective and will make one more receptive to healing. This applies to all types of medicine, but in the case of psychological disease it is more effective than in the case of physical disease.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Many remedies are more effective if one has faith in them and takes them willingly and happily. People have seen wonders in that regard, because in that case human nature is highly receptive to medicine, and&nbsp; the soul feels joy in having it, which revives the patient’s strength and reinforces his natural defences, causing his body’s resources to come together to resist disease and ward off the harm. On the other hand, many medicines may be effective for a particular disease, but what nullifies their effect is if the patient does not believe in the remedy and his body does not accept it, so it does not help him at all.</p>\n<p>You may think of the greatest medicines and remedies, and the most beneficial for hearts and bodies, and the most useful in this world and the hereafter, namely the Qur’an which is healing for every disease, and how it does not benefit hearts that do not believe that it contains healing and benefit; rather it only increases them in (spiritual) sickness. There is no medicine that could heal hearts more effectively than the Qur’an, for it brings complete healing for hearts that does not leave any sickness behind, but it cures it, and it preserves (spiritual) health in perfect order, granting full protection from every harmful thing.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the fact that most hearts turn away from it (the Qur’an) and do not have firm belief in it, when there is no doubt that it is a healing, and they fail to use it and ignore it in favour of other medicines that are put together by human beings, prevents hearts from attaining healing; habits and customs take over, aversion becomes greater, chronic diseases and sickness become entrenched in people’s hearts, and patients and doctors become accustomed to human remedies and what their shaykhs and those whom they venerate and hold in high esteem prescribe for them, thus the calamity is exacerbated and the disease worsens.</p>\n<p>Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/92).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to wipe over two layers of socks worn one over another? If that is permissible and a person wipes over them, then takes off one layer and then breaks his wudoo’, is it permissible for him to wipe over the other or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is permissible for a person to wear two layers of khufoof     or socks. If he wipes over one – in cases where it is permissible to do so,     as we shall see below – then he takes one off, and breaks his wudoo’, it is     permissible for him to wipe over the other, according to the opinion of some     of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) a number     of scenarios in which a person wears two layers of khufoof or socks, as     follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – If a person put on socks or khufoof then broke his     wudoo’, then put on another pair before doing wudoo’, the ruling applies to     the first layer, i.e., if he wants to wipe over them after that, he has to     wipe over the first layer, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over     the second layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – If he puts on socks or khufoof, then he breaks his wudoo’     and wipes over them, then he puts on a second layer, then he may wipe over     the second layer according to the sound view. It says in al-Furoo’:     That is permissible according to Maalik. End quote. Al-Nawawi said: This is     the best view, because he put them on in a state of purity (tahaarah), and     their view that it is a lesser kind of purity is not acceptable. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If we accept that, then the period of wiping starts from the     first time he wiped over the first layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In this case he may also wipe over the first layer, without a     doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – If he puts khufoof on over khufoof or socks, and he wipes     the outer layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the     remainder of the period? I did not see any clear statement on this, but     al-Nawawi stated that Abu’l-‘Abbaas ibn Surayj said that if he puts     overshoes over the khufoof then one of three scenarios must apply: one of     which is that they become like a single khuff, with the upper layer visible     and the second layer like a lining, therefore he may wipe over the lower     layer until the period for wiping ends from the time he wiped over the upper     layer, which is like the case when the outer surface of the khuff becomes     worn or scratched – it is permissible to wipe over the lining.” End quote     from Fataawa al-Tahaarah, p. 192&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The “overshoe” (jurmooq) is something that is worn over the     regular khufoof, especially in cold countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 1/130&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/211&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it acceptable to search for treatments for impotence?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is permissible to search for treatments for impotence because this is a disease and a sickness, and Islam permits the treatment of sickness. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, O slaves of Allah, seek cures for sickness, for Allah does not create any disease but He also creates the cure for it – or medicine for it – except for one disease.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is that?” He said, “Old age.”</p>\n<p>(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1961; classed as saheeh by al-Albani – may Allah have mercy on him – in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2/202).

      "title": "Should she go ahead with this marriage or not?",
      "question": "<p>I am a young Muslim woman with a good heart and I am righteous in all my actions. Fate decreed that I should become engaged to my cousin, whom I did not know before because he lives in America. I got to know him a little when he visited our country, and after that he left. We have gotten engaged and we agreed to get married in eight months' time, so that I can finish my studies, but after he left and we got in touch with one another, we began to disagree about many matters. Every time we phone one another it only ends in feeling upset, and he is not the person that I knew before; he has changed completely. We have thought about separating, but our relatives have interfered and prevented a divorce. But the relationship did go back to what it was at first. I am confused about what to do – should I go ahead or cancel it?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If your cousin is righteous and adheres to his religion,     prays regularly and is of good character, then do not hasten to seek a     separation. Many minor differences can be dealt with and an understanding     can be reached. It may need some time in order to get used to one another     and become comfortable with one another. But the most important matter is     his relationship with his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and his     adherence to his religion. The one who is religious will help his family to     obey Allaah and will being them closer to pleasing Allaah. Such a person is     usually trustworthy, for his religious commitment will prevent him from     mistreating his family or being unjust, especially if you travel with him     and go to live far from your family. But if he is careless with regard to     his religious commitment and does not pray regularly, and is not known to be     righteous and upright, then undoubtedly marriage to him is a dangerous     matter, because the one who is negligent towards his religious commitment     will be more negligent in other matters; if a person neglects the rights of     his Lord and Creator, it will come as no surprise that he neglects the     rights of others. Leaving one who is like this now is better than leaving     him later, before the marriage is consummated and any children are born.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to pray istikhaarah, for the one who seeks guidance     from his Lord and prays istikhaarah cannot lose. And consult righteous     people among your family who know about your husband and his character and     nature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information on praying istikhaarah, please see     questions no. <a href=\"/en/answers/11981\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">11981</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/2217\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">2217</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You should strive to equip yourself with the best of     characteristics and attitudes, for both spouses are enjoined to do that. The     problem may also be due to you as well. Perhaps your husband has complaints     about your attitude and behaviour just as you have about his. We ask Allaah     to set your affairs straight and to make good easy for you wherever it is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In your question you say \"fate decreed\". This is a grave     error, for fate has no will. What you should say is \"Allaah willed\" or     \"Allaah decreed\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was     asked about saying, \"circumstances dictated that such and such should     happen\" or \"fate decreed that such and such should happen.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Saying \"fate willed\" or \"circumstances willed\" are     reprehensible phrases, because circumstances or time have no will, and fate     has no will. Rather the One who wills and decrees is Allaah, may He be     exalted and glorified. It would be better for a person to say: \"The decree     of Allaah dictated that such and such should happen.\" There is nothing wrong     with that. But it is not permissible to attribute will to fate. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo' Fataawa Ibn 'Uthaymeen,     3/113&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is the person who was entrusted with something liable if he leaves it in the airport because of excess weight?",
      "question": "<p>My friend asked me for a favour to carry her luggage abroad, and I agreed. At the airport, I realized the weight limit has exceeded (due to misreading my ticket) and had to leave some items behind. In rush and illness, I forgot 3 items at the airport while sending back excess baggage. Unaware of this loss, I travelled and delivered the rest of her belongings, approximately 11-12 kgs of goods, to her.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, she informed me that some or all goods (not sure) belonged to a 3rd party, not her (She didn't inform me before), and the missing items were theirs. My friend demanded $105 as compensation for the lost items of 3rd party, holding me fully responsible for the accidental loss and denied to take any burden of loss on herself. I paid the amount but suggested that it's fair for me to then seek remuneration for my service of transporting goods from abroad as I compensated for the loss of 3rd party. However, my friend took the money and refused, saying no conditions were set before I agreed to carry her belongings so my claim for service is baseless.</p>\n<p>• In a scenario with no prior terms and conditions, is the person carrying someone's goods responsible to compensate for accidental damages or losses during the journey?</p>\n<p>• The money I paid, was it their lawful right and permissible for them to keep it in this matter?</p>\n<p>• What would be the solution for this issue?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If someone is asked to transport some luggage and the like, this luggage is regarded as a trust under his care, and he is not liable for loss or damage unless he transgressed or was negligent, whether he is transporting it voluntarily or in return for payment. That is because in the case of one who is hired or appointed as a proxy, whatever is given to him to take care of is a trust (amanah).</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat</em> (2/202): The proxy is in a position of trust. He is not liable if something is lost or damaged whilst in his care if he has not been negligent, because he is the proxy of the owner in possessing and disposing of it. So if it is destroyed when it is under his care, it is as if it was destroyed when under the care of its owner. This is like one who is given something for safekeeping, or the guardian of an orphan, and so on. It makes no difference whether he does that voluntarily or for payment; if he is negligent or transgresses, then he is liable. End quote.</p>\n<p>Leaving the excess baggage in the airport is regarded as negligence, and you should have contacted the owner of the items and worked out an arrangement to transfer those goods and pay excess baggage fees, or left them with someone honest, or told her to come and get them, and the like.</p>\n<p>Based on that, you are liable for these goods. If you can find a replacement for them, you must replace them, otherwise you are liable for their value on the day on which they were lost.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If there was no agreement between you regarding payment for transporting the luggage, this means that you were doing it voluntarily, and you have no right now to demand payment.</p>\n<p>Anyone who carries luggage for someone else, or does work for him without a prior agreement on payment is doing it voluntarily, so he has no right to demand payment, unless that is his work which he does for a living, such as porters in the airport and the like. They are to be paid, even if there was no prior agreement.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Kashshaf al-Qina‘</em> (4/206):</p>\n<p>Whoever does work for someone else without prior agreement on fees is not entitled to anything. That is because he offered his help without stipulating anything, so he is not entitled to any payment. That is so that no one will be obliged to pay anything that he did not commit to pay. This applies if the one who offered his help was not offering to do something that he does for a living. If he does do that for a living – such as sailors, porters, cuppers, fullers, tailors, real estate agents and so on, and such as those who measure and weigh things, and the like, who earn their living by doing these things – and the owner gives him permission to do that work, then he is entitled to the same wage as his peers, because that is what is customary.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>Based on that, you are not entitled to payment, because there was no prior agreement to that effect.</p>\n<p>You should seek reward with Allah for what happened to you, for the reward with Allah for righteous deeds will not be lost.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Does that refer only to Islamic knowledge, or can it be extended to beneficial worldly knowledge? I have a doctorate, and by His grace, Allah has granted me considerable knowledge in various fields, in physics, astronomy, mathematics and other subjects. I want to set up a website to make a series of video lectures on these subjects, so that high school and university students can benefit from them, for free, and to help them in pass their exams in school on the one hand, and on the other hand so that they may learn about the wonders of Allah’s creation in the universe, through astronomy, and I want to do that for the sake of Allah.

Whoever conceals (the fault of) a Muslim in this world, Allah will conceal him (his faults) in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will help a person so long as he is helping his brother. Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make a path to Paradise easy for him…” Narrated by Muslim (2699).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A long time ago, maybe several months ago, when I was doing wudu, I wiped my left ear before the right ear, and I did not realise until today. What is the ruling on my prayer? Please note that I wash my right hand before my left hand, and my right foot before my left foot, but I was not paying attention and forgot that when washing my ears.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The authentic hadiths indicate that the way to wipe the ears when doing wudu is to wipe both of them at the same time. Abu Dawud, 135, narrated that a man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, how should I purify myself? He called for water in a vessel, and washed his hands three times, then he washed his face three times, then he washed his forearms three times, then he wiped his head, and he put his index fingers into his ears and wiped the outside of his ears with his thumbs and wiped the inside of his ears with his index fingers, then he washed his feet three times each. Then he said: “This is how wudu is to be done, and whoever does more or less then this has done wrong.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud.</p>\n<p>Starting on the right when doing wudu applies to the hands and feet only; in the case of the ears, the Sunnah is to wipe them both at the same time.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Our companions said: He should wipe the ears at the same time, and not wipe the right ear first. However, if he is one-handed, he should wash the right ear first. Ar-Ruwayani narrated a different view, which is that it is recommended to start with the right, but this is an odd and wrong view.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Majmu`, 1/444.</p>\n<p>It says something similar in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah, 1/9.</p>\n<p>But if the person who is doing wudu wipes one of his ears before the other, whether he starts with the right or the left, he has gone against the Sunnah and gone against what is better, but his wudu is valid.</p>\n<p>Al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: However he wipes his ears is valid, like the head, but what is prescribed in the Sunnah is to wipe them both by putting the index fingers in the ear and wiping the outside of the ear with the thumbs.</p>\n<p>End quote from Kashshaf al-Qina`, 1/101.</p>\n<p>We stated previously in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/115246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">115246</a> that if someone omits to wipe his ears when doing wudu, his wudu is valid. So if someone wipes his ears but he goes against the Sunnah in the manner in which he wipes them, it is more appropriate to say that his wudu is valid.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

He said: “Recite these five soorahs: ‘Qul ya ayyuhal kaafiroon’ [al-Kaafiroon 109], ‘Idha ja’a nasr Allahi wal fath’ [al-Nasr 110], Qul Huwa Allahu ahad [al-Ikhlaas 112], Qul a‘oodhi bi rabbi’l-falaq [al-Falaq 113] and Qul a‘oodhu bi raabi’n-naas [an-Naas 114]. Start your recitation by saying Bismillah ir-Rahmaan ir-Raheem and end your recitation by saying Bismillah ir-Rahmaan ir-Raheem.” Jubayr said: I was rich and had a great deal of wealth, and I used to set out with whomever Allah willed I should set out with on a journey, and I would be the worst of them in appearance and the least in terms of provisions. From the time the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) taught me it, I have never stopped reciting them, and I am one of the best of them in appearance and have the most provisions, until I come back from my journey.</p>\n<p>This was narrated by Abu Ya‘la in his Musnad, 13/339, hadeeth no 7419.</p>\n<p>This is a da‘eef (weak) hadeeth; its isnaad includes unknown narrators.</p>\n<p>Al-Haythami said concerning it in Majma‘ az-Zawaa’id (10/134): (Its isnaad) includes people who I do not know.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Albaani said concerning it in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah (6963): (it is) munkar.</p>\n<p>Based on that, it is not valid to quote this hadeeth as evidence to suggest that it is mustahabb to recite any soorahs of the Quran before travelling. By the same token, it is not valid to quote it as evidence for saying the basmalah at the beginning of each soorah.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31]</p>\n<p>Adorning oneself for prayer is something that is additional to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/126265\" target=\"_blank\">covering the `awrah</a> . Hence women are commanded to cover their heads when praying, although they are allowed to uncover their heads in front of their mahrams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to adorning oneself for prayer, it is something that is additional to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/43\" target=\"_blank\">covering the ‘awrah</a> , and it is based on the Quran, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus. In the Quran, there is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31], which Allah revealed because the disbelievers used to circumambulate the Ka’bah naked. Every place of prostration is a mosque (masjid), and this indicates that covering oneself for prayer and tawaf is what is meant by adorning oneself to worship Allah. Hence the word adornment is used rather than the word covering, to demonstrate that what is meant is that a person should adorn himself and not limit it to simply covering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the Sunnah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept the prayer of any woman who menstruates except with a head covering.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to scholarly consensus, Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars unanimously agreed that a free, adult woman must cover her head when she prays, and that if she prays with her entire head uncovered, then she must repeat the prayer. Others also narrated that there was consensus that covering is an essential condition.” (Sharh al-‘Umdah, 4/258, 259)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_we_pray_in_half_sleeves_or_bare-headed\">Can we pray in half sleeves or bare-headed?</span></h3>\n<p>Once this is understood, although the worshipper must adorn himself for prayer, this adornment may vary from one country to another, according to their customs, including what is mentioned in the question, which is praying in a garment with half-sleeves or praying bare-headed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the custom of that land is that the best adornment is to cover the head or to pray in a garment with full sleeves, then praying when one is dressed as mentioned in the question is contrary to what Allah has enjoined, even if the prayer itself is valid. But if the custom of the people in that country is to dress as described in the question, then there is nothing wrong with praying dressed in this manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the ruling also varies according to variations in the dress itself. The garment may have short sleeves and that may be customarily worn in some countries where it may be worn as an adornment, or a man may go to work in it and so on. In that case there is nothing wrong with praying in it. Or it may be the custom that this is not a kind of adornment, and it is something that a man wears at home only, or when sleeping only, in which case it is not appropriate to pray in it.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Scholarly_views_on_praying_while_not_wearing_anything_on_his_head\">Scholarly views on praying while not wearing anything on his head</span></h3>\n<p>There follow the fatwas of the scholars, which include the principle mentioned above, which is that this ruling depends on the customs in each country.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: an imam leads the people in prayer and he is not wearing anything on his head. What is the ruling on that?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with that, because the head is not part of the `awrah, rather what is required is to pray in a lower and upper garment, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should pray in a single garment with no part of it over his shoulders.” But if he wears his adornment and dresses fully, that is preferable, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raaf 7:31]</p>\n<p>But if he is in a country where it is not customary to cover the head, then there is nothing wrong with leaving it bare.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/405, 406)&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He was also asked: Is it permissible to pray without a turban? Is it permissible for the imam who is leading the people in prayer to pray without a head cover? Is the taqiyyah (kufi, skull-cap) sufficient?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/155330\" target=\"_blank\">praying without a turban</a> because the head is not ‘awrah, and it is not obligatory to cover it whilst praying, whether one is praying as an imam, praying alone or following an imam. But if wearing a turban is customary then it is better to do it, especially when praying with other people, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31] and this is part of adornment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that men who are in ihram pray bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads whilst in ihram. Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with praying bareheaded.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/406)&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"Ibn ‘Umar said to his freed slave Nafi’: “Do you go and meet people bareheaded?” He said: “No.” He said: “Allah has more right that you should be modest before Him.” This indicates that it is better to cover the head, but if we apply the words of Allah - (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31] – to this issue, we will see that covering the head is better among people who regard covering the head as a kind of adornment. But if we are among people who do not regard that as a kind of adornment, we do not say that covering it is better or that leaving it bare is better. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray in a turban, and the turban is a head covering.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/166)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69855\" target=\"_blank\">69855</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/103431\" target=\"_blank\">103431</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

He would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray three.

Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one hundred verses will be recorded as one of the devout. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one thousand verses will be recorded as one of the&nbsp;<em>muqantirin</em>.”</p>\n<p>Al-Mundhiri said in at-Targhib wa't-Tarhib: “The phrase “one of the muqantirin” means: one of those for whom will be decreed a qintar [huge amount] of reward, starting from the Surah&nbsp;<em>Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk</em>&nbsp;[i.e., Surat al-Mulk] until the end of the Quran, one thousand verses. And Allah knows best.”</p>\n<p>Some of the jurists said: “The minimum for Qiyam is eight rak`ahs.”</p>\n<p>And some of them said that it means spending [the entire] night or most of it in prayer.</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;<em>ad-Durr al-Mukhtar</em>: “The minimum for the night prayers, according to what it says in&nbsp;<em>al-Jawharah</em>, is eight [rak`ahs].”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abidin said in his commentary on&nbsp;<em>ad-Durr al-Mukhtar</em>&nbsp;(2/25): &nbsp;“With regard to the words “The minimum for the night prayers, according to what it says in&nbsp;<em>al-Jawharah</em>, is eight [rak`ahs]”, the reason why he said “according to what it says in&nbsp;<em>al-Jawharah</em>” is because in&nbsp;<em>al-Hawi al-Qudsi</em>&nbsp;he said: He may pray whatever he is able to, even if it is only two [rak`ahs], but the Sunnah in [Qiyam al-layl] is to pray eight rak`ahs with four taslims. End quote. … He also said in it: This is based on the fact that the minimum the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed in tahajjud was two rak`ahs, and the maximum he prayed was eight rak`ahs, quoting from what is mentioned in&nbsp;<em>al-Mabsut</em>&nbsp;by as-Sarkhasi. Then, to support his shaykh, al-Muhaqqiq ibn al-Humam, he quoted the hadiths which prove what his shaykh specified in&nbsp;<em>al-Mabsut</em>&nbsp;and the hadith of Abu Dawud which proves that the minimum that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed in tahajjud was four rak`ahs, apart from <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/46544\" target=\"_blank\">the three rak`ahs of Witr</a> .</p>\n<p>But towards the end, he narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wakes up at night and wakes his wife, and they pray two rak`ahs together, they will be recorded among the men and women who remember Allah much.” Narrated by an-Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban in his&nbsp;<em>Sahih</em>, and al-Hakim.

And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah</em>&nbsp;(1/112) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Among them [the prayers] is Qiyam al-layl, as is mentioned in&nbsp;<em>al-Bahr ar-Raiq</em>. The maximum that [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] prayed in tahajjud was eight rak`ahs and&nbsp; the minimum was two rak`ahs.

But what appears to be the case according to custom is that it cannot be said that someone prayed Qiyam unless he stayed up for the entire night, or most of it.”</p>\n<p>The correct view is what we have noted above, which is that praying Qiyam may be achieved by praying&nbsp;two rak`ahs.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_pray_Qiyam_as_one_rakah\">Can you pray Qiyam as one rak`ah?</span></h3>\n<p>There is a report which indicates that the minimum of Qiyam is one rak`ah, but it is not sahih.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to pray at night, and he urged us to do that to the extent that he said: “You should offer voluntary prayer at night, even if it is only one rak`ah.” (Narrated by at-Tabarani in&nbsp;<em>al-Kabir</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>al-Awsat</em>)</p>\n<p>This report was classed as weak by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Da‘if at-Targhib</em>&nbsp;<em>wa’t-Tarhib</em>&nbsp;(365).</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I mentioned Qiyam al-layl, and some of them said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Half of it, or one third of it, or one quarter of it, the time between two milkings of a she-camel, or the time between two milkings of milking a ewe.” (Narrated by Abu Ya‘la, classed as weak by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Da‘if at-Targhib wa't-Tarhib</em>&nbsp;(364)</p>\n<p>“the time between two milkings of a she-camel” – that was because they would milk the she-camel, then leave her for a while to allow the calf to suckle, so she would begin to produce more milk.” (<em>Fayd al-Qadir</em>&nbsp;(6/173)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_Witr_part_of_Qiyam_al-layl\">Is Witr part of Qiyam al-layl?</span></h3>\n<p>It should be understood that Witr does not come under the heading of Qiyam al-layl, so it cannot be understood from the fact that it is valid to pray Witr with one rak`ah, that the minimum for Qiyam is one rak`ah too.</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;<em>Kashshaf al-Qina‘</em>&nbsp;(5/23): <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/52875\" target=\"_blank\">Is Witr part of Qiyam al-layl or something else?</a> There are two possibilities, the most likely which is the second, which is that Witr is not part of Qiyam al-layl, because of the hadith quoted by Ibn ‘Aqil: “Witr, tahajjud and two rak`ahs of Fajr.” Shaykh Taqiy ad-Din said: Here our companions differentiated between Witr and Qiyam al-layl.”</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Strive_hard_to_offer_Qiyam_al-laylnbsp\">Strive hard to offer Qiyam al-layl&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>It is no secret <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3749\" target=\"_blank\">Qiyam al-layl requires effort and preparation</a> , especially in Ramadan, and the more prayers a person does, the greater his reward will be, because for every prostration Allah will raise the person one degree in status.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (488) narrated that Ma‘dan ibn Abi Talhah al-Ya‘muri said: I met Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and said: Tell me of a deed that I may do, by which Allah may admit me to Paradise – or he said: Tell me of the most beloved of deeds to Allah. He remained silent. I asked him (again) and he remained silent. I asked him a third time and he said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “You should prostrate to Allah a great deal, for you will not perform one prostration to Allah but Allah will raise you one degree in status thereby and erase one sin for you.” Ma’dan said: Then I met Abu’l-Darda and asked him (the same question), and he said the same as Thawban had said to me.</p>\n<p>It is most unfortunate for a person to limit himself to doing two rak`ahs, except for a serious reason that may happen on some nights, such as if he is too tired, or too busy doing work that prevents him from praying and he is unable to delay the work until another time when he is free. But when one is able to do it and is free, not praying more may be indicative of weak resolve, or it may be a sign of carelessness and weak faith.</p>\n<p>So strive hard and persist, make your intention sincerely for the sake of Allah Alone, and strive against your self which is inclined to be lazy; push yourself to do acts of worship until it becomes easy for you to do them.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide and help us and you.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

And Allah is the Source of strength.” &nbsp; (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/442)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_take_part_in_lotteries\"><strong>Can you take part in lotteries?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin was asked:</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on taking part in <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98151\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lotteries</a> , which means that a person buys a ticket and if he is lucky he gets a lot of money, knowing that this person intends to use that money for Islamic projects and to help the mujahidin so that they will benefit from that?</p>\n<p>He answered:</p>\n<p>“What the questioner describes, where a person buys a ticket then if he is lucky – as he says – he gets a lot of money, comes under the heading of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gambling</a> , of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, etc.), and Al Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.</p>\n<p>Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So, will you not then abstain?</p>\n<p>And obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of even coming near to drinking or gambling or Al Ansab, or Al Azlam) and fear Allah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way” [al-Maidah 5:90-91]</p>\n<p>This gambling – which is any transaction in which a person may win or lose, and he does not know whether he will be a winner or a loser – is all haram. Indeed, it is one of the major sins, and its abhorrent nature is no secret when one realizes that Allah mentions it in conjunction with idol-worship, alcohol and azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision). Whatever benefits may be hoped for from gambling pale into insignificance beside the harm that it causes. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“They ask you (O Muhammad) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.’” [al-Baqarah 2:219]</p>\n<p>Think about this verse, where benefits are mentioned in the plural, and sin is mentioned in the singular. Allah did not say, “In it are many sins and (some) benefits for men”, rather He said (interpretation of the meaning): “a great sin”. This is an indication that the benefits, no matter how numerous they may be, are insignificant when compared with this great sin; the great sin far outweighs them. So its sin is greater than its benefits, no matter what they are. &nbsp;(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/441)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_gamble_occasionally\"><strong>Can you gamble occasionally?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>With regard to a person’s saying that he only gambles occasionally, this is like one who says that he only commits adultery occasionally, or he only steals occasionally, or he only lies occasionally. Does the fact that he commits that haram action only rarely mean that it is not a sin and that he is not exposed to the wrath of Allah? How does he know that this rare action will not develop into something that is done more frequently, until it becomes a habit? In fact this is what usually happens, especially in the case of those who are afflicted by gambling. He should fear Allah and abstain from that which Allah has forbidden to him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He suffers from compulsive waswaas and speaks words of kufr; does he have to do anything?",
      "question": "<p>My question is: I am a young girl of 19 years who has received a proposal. He was my senior in high school and unfortunately we had a short lived haram relationship of talking to each other unlawfully. We both repented and he wants to marry me. His father is an apostate suffering from Bipolar type 2 disorder and Obsessive compulsive disorder. I read that OCD patients suffer from religious obsessions about the devil. Is he accountable for his apostasy due to his mental illness? secondly, he wants to know how to deal with this situation in the correct way as well as the rest of the family. his mother still lives with his father. Due to his illness, the father also caused financial ruin (linked to bipolar 2). What are the rights of the family in this case and the rights of the father over them? He is extremely non compliant with treatment. Lastly, if i do marry him, what kind of relationship should I and our children have with his father?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Compulsive waswaas refers to thoughts and bad ideas that come one after another to a person’s mind even though he does not want them, in such a way that he cannot rid himself of them, even though he knows and is certain that they are foolish and unacceptable thoughts. They keep coming to his mind compulsively, which causes him a great deal of anguish and distress.</p>\n<p>The remedy for compulsive waswaas and other types of waswaas is to remember Allah a great deal, obey Him, and turn to Him, beseeching Him, and seeking refuge with Him; to overlook and ignore the waswaas, and not let oneself get carried away with it. In some cases there is a need to consult a doctor.</p>\n<p>See the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39684\">39684</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/90819\">90819</a>.</p>\n<p>Allah will not punish a person or call him to account for this waswaas, because it is beyond his control and overwhelms him; it does not happen by his choice. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>\n<p>“Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.”</p>\n<p>[al-Talaaq 65:7]</p>\n<p>“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”</p>\n<p>[al-Taghaabun 64:16].</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6664; Muslim, 127.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Allah will not punish the one who suffers from compulsive waswaas, because He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear” [al-Baqarah 2:286] and “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. But the one who is suffering from waswaas has to frequently seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan and ignore it; if he does that, then it will depart from him by Allah’s leave. End quote.</p>\n<p>Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 24/2</p>\n<p>If this man speaks words of kufr (disbelief) and words that put him beyond the pale of Islam because of this compulsive waswaas, without being aware of what he is saying or understanding what it means, or he understands what it means but he did not intend to say it and did not say it voluntarily – rather he said it under the pressure of this waswaas which forced him to say it – then he will not be punished for it, because it is beyond his control. He comes under the same ruling as one who speaks words of kufr because he is forced to do so. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith but such as open their hearts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a great torment”</p>\n<p>[an-Nahl 16:106].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If he is forced to disbelieve and he disbelieves, but his heart is at rest with Faith, then he is not deemed to be a disbeliever, because there is an impediment to doing so, which is that he was forced. End quote.</p>\n<p>Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen, 3/54</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/229:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to describe as a disbeliever one who was forced to utter words of disbelief when his heart was at rest with Faith. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “…except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith …” [an-Nahl 16:106]. End quote.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/62839\">62839</a></p>\n<p>Based on that, this man is not to be deemed an apostate, unless he says or does something to indicate disbelief at the time when he is aware of what he is doing, and he says or does it voluntarily. In that case he would be deemed an apostate and would bear full responsibility for his words or deeds.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The family’s role towards this poor father may be summed up as follows:</p>\n<p>1.All the members of the family have to show patience towards him with regard to unpleasant things that happen with him, because that is happening without him intending it to.</p>\n<p>2.They should strive to find treatment for him and spend as much as they can on that, and use tricks to treat him. Many cases of waswaas are in fact cases of sickness that can be treated by psychologists and the like.</p>\n<p>3.They should offer a lot of supplication and beseech Allah to remove this harm and heal him.</p>\n<p>4.Ruqya as prescribed in Islam. His son, wife or any other family member or other person may perform ruqya for him as prescribed in Islam. Allah may heal types of chronic sickness by His grace, by means of Islamically prescribed ruqya from the Qur’an and Sunnah.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3476\">3476</a></p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If this suitor is of good character and religiously committed, then there is nothing wrong with marrying him, whether his father is healthy or otherwise, and whether he is a Muslim or an apostate. None of those factors are an impediment to marrying his son, so long as the son is religiously committed and of good character.</p>\n<p>However we do not think that you should rush to accept such a person; rather proceeding with caution in the case of such proposals that may lead to complicated social problems is better, more sensible and wiser.</p>\n<p>You have to let your guardians know about the matter and they should find out the facts for themselves, so that they can make the right decision for their daughter.</p>\n<p>If you feel that this will have an impact on your life and your social relationships, then you are still young, so if you wait for a more suitable opportunity that is less likely to cause you problems, then perhaps that is better and more appropriate.</p>\n<p>If you insist on accepting this suitor, and your guardians agree to it, then you and your husband should have separate accommodation; that is more likely to avoid problems and keep you away from troubles.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he will be the grandfather of your children and also your father-in-law, the father of your husband, so you should strive hard to treat him kindly as much as you can.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/146463\">146463</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

We are worried about this, but this is the only bank that accepted to finance us this way. Is this halal or no? They told us that this is a legal way Islamically. They explained that what they do is buying iron for many people and then they receive a permission of them for selling it.

But if you are not selling it yourself, rather you are delegating the bank to sell it, then this is called tawarruq that is organized by the bank, and a resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Council has stated that it is haram.

      "question": "<p>Is the one who could have asked about the ruling on some action, but did not ask, regarded as if proof was established against him? For example, if he is not sure whether doing something is a sin or not, then he decided not to ask about the ruling on it, is there any sin on him if he goes ahead and does that thing, when that thing is a sin? If possible, please refer to scholarly views on this issue, and say which you think is most likely to be correct, if there is no consensus on the matter.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>What the Muslim must do is learn before he acts. So it is not permissible for him to go ahead and do something when he does not know the ruling on it. That becomes more important if he is not sure whether that thing is a sin or not.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned}&nbsp;[al-Isra’ 17:36].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>In this verse, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, forbids pursuing that of which one has no knowledge… That includes speaking without knowledge, or doing some actions about which one has no knowledge. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, refers to this meaning in other verses.\"(<em>Adwa’ al-Bayan</em>&nbsp; 3/682).</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his <em>Sahih</em>:</p>\n<p>Chapter: Learning before speaking or acting, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So know, [O Muhammad], that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah} [Muhammad 47:19]; thus He began with knowledge.</p>\n<p>The scholars are the heirs of the prophets, who left behind a legacy of knowledge. Whoever acquires that knowledge has taken an abundant share, and whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge}&nbsp;[Fatir 35:28]</p>\n<p>{But none will understand them except those of knowledge}&nbsp;[al-‘Ankabut 29:43]</p>\n<p>{And they will say, “If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze”}&nbsp;[al-Mulk 67:10]</p>\n<p>{Are those who know equal to those who do not know?}&nbsp;[az-Zumar 39:9].</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He grants him understanding of religion” and “Knowledge is only acquired through learning.” Abu Dharr said: If you put this sword on here – and he pointed to the back of his neck – then I thought that I could convey a word I heard from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before you kill me, I would convey it.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbas said: Be pious scholars of the Lord, possessed of forbearing and understanding. It was said that the pious scholar [<em>rabbani</em>] is the one who starts by teaching people easy issues of knowledge before difficult issues.</p>\n<p>Ibn Majah narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ishaq ibn Rahawayh said: Seeking knowledge is obligatory, although there is no soundly-narrated report which says that. But what is meant is that the individual must seek the knowledge of how to do what he needs to do, such as wudu’ and prayer, zakah if he has wealth, and also Hajj and so on…</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Umar said: Ishaq meant – and Allah knows best – that regarding the hadith about the obligation to seek knowledge, there are some reservations among the scholars of hadith about its isnad, but its meaning is correct in their view…</p>\n<p>Then he narrated with his isnad from ‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq that the latter said: I said to Ibn al-Mubarak: What is the thing that the believer cannot do unless he seeks knowledge about it? And what must he learn? He said: He cannot take any action except on the basis of knowledge, and he cannot acquire knowledge unless he asks.\"(<em>Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi</em>&nbsp; 1/52-56).</p>\n<p>This is a matter on which the scholars are agreed.</p>\n<p>Al-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali narrated in <em>Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din</em> that there was consensus on that. Ash-Shafa‘i also narrated in <em>ar-Risalah</em> that it is not permissible for the accountable person to take any action until he knows the ruling of Allah concerning it. So the one who becomes involved in buying and selling must learn the rulings and guidelines that Allah has prescribed with regard to buying and selling. The one who gets involved in renting and hiring must learn what Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to renting and hiring. The one who wants to lend or borrow money must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to lending and borrowing. The one who wants to offer a particular prayer must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed for that prayer. The same applies to purification and all other words and deeds.\"(A<em>l-Furuq&nbsp;</em>2/275).</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (2964) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said:</p>\n<p>… One of you will be fine so long as he fears Allah. If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Regarding his words “If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer,” what he means is that part of fearing Allah is not doing anything that you are unsure of until you ask someone who has knowledge about that, so that he can give you an answer regarding it.\"(A<em>t-Tawdih</em>&nbsp; 18/81).</p>\n<p>Ash-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one who follows a scholar is faced with some religious issue, he has no option but to ask about it, and that is the general ruling, because Allah did not ask the people to worship Him on the basis of ignorance; rather He asked them to worship Him on the basis of the verse in which He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you} [al-Baqarah 2:282]. It is not in the way in which many people interpret this verse; rather, according to the understanding of leading scholars of Arabic language, it means: Allah will teach you about whatever issue you are faced with, so fear Him. It is as if the second thing mentioned (teaching) will lead to the first thing mentioned (taqwa or fear of Allah). So the issue of taqwa (fear of Allah) is connected to the condition, which is that you should acquire knowledge. This means that knowledge comes before actions. There is a great deal of evidence to support this meaning, and this is a matter concerning which there is no dispute among the scholars, so there is no need to discuss it at length.\"(A<em>l-Muwafaqat</em>&nbsp; 5/283).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If someone is required to ask and learn, but he fails to ask about what he is not sure of with regard to his religion by way of negligence, laziness and following whims and desires, then he is undoubtedly being heedless about his religion and exposing himself to punishment.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The one who is able to ask, seek guidance and learn about the truth, but he fails to do that because he is preoccupied with worldly matters, pursuit of leadership, seeking pleasure, making money and so on, is heedless and deserves the punishment, and he is sinning by neglecting what is required of him, which is fearing Allah as much as he can. The ruling in his case is the same ruling as that on others like him who neglect some obligatory duties.\"(A<em>t-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah</em>&nbsp; 1/465).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What is required of the individual is not to delay asking people of knowledge, because the more he delays asking, the more he will increase in sin, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{So [O people] ask those who have knowledge, if you do not know}&nbsp;[an-Nahl 16:43].</p>\n<p>So what the individual must do is ask first, before taking action. If it so happens that he acts, then becomes uncertain, then he must hasten to ask.\"(<em>Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb&nbsp;</em>8/315).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Whoever reviles Allah, may He be exalted, or His Book or any of His angels or Messengers is a disbeliever who is beyond the pale of Islam; it is not permissible to pray behind him because the ummah is unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to pray behind a disbeliever, whether he was originally a disbeliever or is an apostate.

The same ruling applies if he were to fast Ramadan or give zakaah on his wealth. As for the one who prays behind him, if he is aware of his situation, then his prayer is not valid, because he connected his prayer to a prayer that is invalid…. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not valid to pray behind a disbeliever under any circumstances, whether one becomes aware of his being a disbeliever after finishing the prayer or before that. The one who prayed behind him has to repeat his prayer. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i and ashaab ar-ra’y. Abu Thawr and al-Muzani said: The one who prayed behind him and was not aware of the situation does not have to repeat his prayer, because he followed the prayer of one whose situation he was unaware of, so his case is like that of one who followed in prayer a person who is in a state of minor impurity.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni (2/16)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not valid to pray behind a disbeliever in any situation, whether his disbelief is in terms of beliefs, words, actions or things that he fails to do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of belief e.g., if he believes that there is another god besides Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of words e.g., if he ridicules Allah or His Messenger or His religion. Whoever ridicules Allah or His Messenger or His religion is a disbeliever, even if he prays. … We know that no Muslim can pray behind a disbeliever, but if we assume that someone prayed behind a man and was not aware that he was a disbeliever until after the prayer was over, does he have to repeat the prayer or not?</p>\n<p>The answer is that some of the scholars said that he does not have to repeat the prayer, because he is excused.</p>\n<p>And some scholars said that he does have to repeat the prayer, because one of the conditions of leading the prayer being valid is that the imam should be a Muslim.</p>\n<p>If someone were to say: can we differentiate and say that if the signs of disbelief are obvious in his case, then the prayer is not valid, and there is no excuse for ignorance because there is circumstantial evidence, otherwise the prayer is not invalid?</p>\n<p>Our answer is: that may be the case. The more correct scholarly view concerning this issue is that if he is unaware (of the imam being an apostate), then his prayer is valid.</p>\n<p>End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (4/220).</p>\n<p>Based on that, the prayers that you offered behind that evildoer imam are not valid on his part, primarily because of his being an apostate, or on your part, because your prayer was connected to the prayer of an apostate. So you have to repeat all of these prayers, and strive hard to work out how many they are, until you think it most likely that you have done what you have to do. This is the view of the majority of scholars.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/439):</p>\n<p>If the number of missed prayers is great, he should try hard to make them up, unless that will cause him physical or financial hardship. As for physical hardship, that is when he may get too tired or may fear sickness. As for financial hardship, that is when it could lead to him becoming unable to dispose of his wealth (and run his business), to the point that it keeps him away from earning a living, or he may be harmed by that. Ahmad stated something to this effect. If he does not know how many prayers he owes, he should keep making them up until he is certain that he has made up all that he missed. Ahmad said, according to the report of Saalih, concerning a man who had missed prayers: he should keep making them up until he is sure that he has made up all that he missed.

So how about if he combines these two evil deeds? How could such a person pray to the Lord of the Worlds, let alone become an imam?!</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20885\" target=\"_blank\">20885</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/129407\" target=\"_blank\">129407</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Why has Allah appointed some of the angels in charge of some affairs of the universe, even though He has no need of them?",
      "question": "<p>Why has Allah appointed certain angels to do tasks when he (s.w.t) can do it himself? Asking out of curiosity</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>One of the basic principles of faith is belief in the noble angels, and belief that Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed each angel to do a certain task. That includes managing some matters of this universe. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And those who arrange [each] matter}&nbsp;[Az-Nazi`at 79:5].</p>\n<p>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Regarding the words {And those who arrange [each] matter}, `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata’, Abu Salih, al-Hasan, Qatadah, ar-Rabi` ibn Anas and as-Suddi said: This refers to the angels. Al-Hasan added: They arrange [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; that is, on the command of their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. There is no difference of scholarly opinion regarding that. (End quote from <em>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</em>, 8/313).</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>{And those who arrange [each] matter} are the angels, whom Allah has appointed to arrange many matters in the upper and lower realms, such as rain, plants, trees, winds, seas, foetuses, animals, paradise, hell and so on. (End quote from <em>Tafsir as-Sa‘di</em>, p. 908).</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Every movement in the heavens and on earth, including the movement of planets, stars, the sun, the moon, winds, clouds, plants and animals, is initiated by the angels who are appointed in charge of the heavens and the earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who arrange [each] matter} [az-Nazi`at 79:5] and {And the [angels] apportioning [each] matter} [adh-Dhariyat 51:4]. These verses refer to the angels, according to those who believe and follow the messengers (peace be upon them)…</p>\n<p>The Qur’an and Sunnah indicate that there are different types of angels, and that they are appointed in charge of different types of created things. Allah, may He be glorified, has appointed angels in charge of the mountains, and has appointed angels in charge of the clouds and rain. He has appointed angels in charge of the wombs, who manage the affairs of the fertilised egg until its creation is completed, then He appoints angels to protect the person, and angels to record his deeds and write them down. He has appointed angels in charge of death, and has appointed angels to question the deceased in the grave. He has appointed angels in charge of heavenly bodies, who control their movements, And He has appointed angels in charge of the sun and moon. He has appointed angels in charge of hell to stoke its flames and punish its occupants, and He has appointed angels in charge of what happens in it. He has appointed angels in charge of paradise and what happens in it, who take care of its plants and rivers.The angels are the greatest of the troops of Allah, may He be exalted. (End quote from <em>Ighathat al-Lahfan</em>, 2/842)</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Even though Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed the angels to manage some matters of His dominion, their management thereof is by His leave and His command, and they only do what they are commanded to do.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The word <em>malak</em> (angel) conveys the sense of a messenger who is carrying out the command of someone else. So the angels have no say in anything; rather the command belongs to Allah, the One, the Compeller, alone, and they carry out His command.</p>\n<p>{They do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.</p>\n<p>He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him}&nbsp;[Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28]</p>\n<p>{They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded}&nbsp;[An-Nahl 16:50]</p>\n<p>{they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded}&nbsp;[At-Tahrim 66:6].</p>\n<p>They only descend by His command, and they do not do anything except after He has given permission. They are honoured slaves of His. Some of them are the [angels] lined up in rows and some of them are those who glorify Him. There is no one among them but he has an assigned place, beyond which he does not go, and he does the task that he was commanded to do, without falling short or overstepping the mark. (End quote from <em>Ighathat al-Lahfan</em>, 2/843).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>One of the things that are definitively proven in Islam is that Allah, may He be exalted, does not do anything except on the basis of ultimate wisdom, whether He has informed us of that or has kept knowledge of it to Himself, may He be glorified and exalted.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of the jinn and humankind, and he (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:</p>\n<p>Before I speak about this matter, I would like to point out a general principle regarding what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates and what He prescribes.</p>\n<p>This principle is taken from the verses (interpretation of the meaning)</p>\n<p>{and He is the Knowing, the Wise} [at-Tahrim 66:2] and {Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise} [an-Nisa’ 4:11], and many other verses which affirm that Allah is wise in what He creates and in what He prescribes – that is, in His universal decree and His religious decree. There is nothing that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates but there is wisdom behind it, whether that is when bringing it into existence or when taking it out of existence.</p>\n<p>And there is nothing that Allah, may He be exalted, prescribes except there is wisdom behind it, whether that is making something obligatory or prohibited or permissible.</p>\n<p>But this wisdom on which His universal decree and religious decree are based may be known to us or it may be unknown, or it may be known to some people and not others, commensurate with the level of knowledge and understanding that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, grants them. (End quote from <em>Majmu` Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin</em>, 1/87).</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The perfect nature of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, is something that is well established and well known to every Muslim, and submitting to it is one of the fundamentals of faith.</p>\n<p>Imam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah enjoined His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all other creatures to worship Him in whatever way He willed, as was stated by His Prophet. No one has the right to question why or how, or add his own view to what was narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). (End quote from <em>al-Umm</em>, 10/16).</p>\n<p>Knowing that motivates the Muslim to focus on purifying himself and not let himself be distracted by giving his view on issues that do not bring any benefit; rather they lead to going to extremes in doubts and expose him to intrusive thoughts (waswasah).</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>You should understand that the basis of servitude and belief in Allah and His Books and His Messengers is submission and not asking about the details of the wisdom behind the commands, prohibitions and other divine laws.</p>\n<p>Hence Allah, may He be glorified, did not tell us that any nation that believed in its prophet and believed in the message he brought to them ever asked him about the details of the wisdom behind what he enjoined them to do and forbade them to do, and what he conveyed to them from their Lord. If they had done that, they would not have been believers in their prophet; rather they accepted the teachings, submitted and surrendered.</p>\n<p>Whatever they learned of the wisdom behind rulings is what they learned, and whatever was hidden from them, their submission and surrender did not depend on knowing that, and the nation never thought that finding out about that wisdom was any of their concern, for they thought too highly of their messenger to ask him about that.</p>\n<p>Hence the early generations of this ummah – which is the most perfect of nations in terms of mature thinking, knowledge and understanding – did not ask their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Why did Allah enjoin such and such? Why did He forbid such and such? Why did He decree such and such? That was because they knew that asking such questions is contrary to faith and submission, and they could not remain steadfast in their commitment to Islam unless they surrendered…</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is not to be questioned about what He does, because of the perfect nature of His wisdom, mercy and justice, not merely because of His might and power. (End quote from <em>Sharh at-Tahhawiyyah</em>, p. 261-262)</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him} [al-Qasas 28:68].</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/186418/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">186418</a>.</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>When the Muslim reflects on the actions of the angels, some aspects of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, will become apparent to him.</p>\n<p>Allah’s creation of the angels and their deeds confirms the perfection of His lordship and His divinity. So when the Muslim learns about the immense size of these angels and their large numbers, and the tasks to which they are appointed, yet despite that not one of them disobeys Allah’s command in the slightest – rather they race to obey Him, may He be glorified and exalted – that is indicative of the perfect lordship and divinity of Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>If the great number of troops and workers of a king in this world is indicative of his perfect sovereignty and control, and is indicative of the high level of obedience that his subjects show him, then in the case of Allah, may He be exalted, this meaning is demonstrated more clearly by His creation of the noble angels. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And they say, “The Most Merciful has taken a son.” Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.</p>\n<p>They do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.</p>\n<p>He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him.</p>\n<p>And whoever of them should say, “Indeed, I am a god besides Him” - that one We would requite with Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers}&nbsp;[Al-Anbiya’ 21:26-29].</p>\n<p>Moreover, for the one who studies the texts of the revelation concerning the existence of the angels and the tasks to which they are appointed, that will instil in him perfect fear of Allah, may He be exalted, and at the same time will instil in him perfect love and hope.</p>\n<p>If he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of punishment and those who write down people’s deeds, that will increase him in fear of Allah. In contrast, if he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of mercy and the guardian angels, that will increase him in love for his Lord and hope of His forgiveness. All of this leads to attaining the level of faith that is enjoined upon people.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.</p>\n<p>They arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend}&nbsp;[As-Sajdah 32:15-16].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Belief in the angels leads to great outcomes, including the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Knowledge of Allah’s greatness, power, might and authority, for the greatness of the created being is connected to the greatness of the Creator.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Gratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, for His care towards the children of Adam, as He has appointed some of these angels to protect them, record their deeds and do other things that are in their interests… (End quote from <em>Majmu` al-Fatawa</em>, 6/89).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the wisdom behind the creation of the noble scribes (the recording angels), even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows all things and nothing that we do in secret or in public is hidden from Him:</p>\n<p>The wisdom behind that is that it highlights the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has created all things in a system, according to estimates and calculations, and He has perfected it to the extent that He has appointed noble scribes to record the words and deeds of the children of Adam, who write down everything that they do, even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows what they will do before they do it.</p>\n<p>But all of that serves to highlight how perfect is the care of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for man, and it highlights the fact that this universe is put together in the best order and is perfectly designed.

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>A woman whose husband dies after doing the marriage contract with her and before consummating the marriage comes under the same rulings as any other wife. Therefore she is entitled to the mahr in full and is entitled to inheritance, and she must observe the ‘iddah, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued a ruling to that effect. It was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was asked about a man who married a woman, and did not specify a mahr for her or consummate the marriage with her before he died. He said: She is entitled to a mahr like that of her peers, no more and no less; she must observe ‘iddah; and she is entitled to inheritance.

      "title": "The wisdom behind deeds being shown to Allah repeatedly, daily, weekly and annually",
      "question": "<p>In one of your fatwas, no. 44021, it says that the showing of deeds (to Allah) is of three types: 1- daily 2- weekly and 3- annually (which is in Sha‘baan). But I am confused: if there is a daily showing throughout the year, then there is no need for the weekly showing which includes the daily showing, and there is also no need for the annual showing which includes both of them. Is this correct?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The taking up of deeds and showing them to     Allah, may He be exalted, daily, weekly and annually is indicated by the     saheeh Sunnah and the words of the scholars, as explained previously in the     answer to question <a href=\"/en/answers/44021\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">44021</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As that is the case, it is not permissible     for anyone to question why Allah does something, or to think that anything     narrated in a sound text is contrary to wisdom, because that will result in     confusion and doubts. Rather what is required is to say as the believers     before him said: We hear and we obey. The one to whom ignorance and lack of     understanding and wisdom could be attributed is the human being and his     understanding and reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, you could add to this question and     say: what need is there for showing deeds to Allah in the first place, when     Allah, may He be exalted, is already aware of everything that people do?     What need is there for the angels to write down people’s deeds, when Allah     has already decreed all that is to happen until the Day of Resurrection,     before He created the heavens and the earth?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The questions that could be added in this     context are many, to such an extent that it would become too difficult for     the individual to close the door to whispers from the Shaytaan after he has     opened it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But as the question was about the wisdom     behind showing deeds to Allah, may He be exalted, every day, then every     week, then every year, according to what is proven in the Sunnah, the answer     is that Allah knows best about the wisdom behind that, and He has not     explained it to us, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) has not explained it to us&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in al-‘Aqeedah at-Tahhaawiyyah wa     Sharhuha (1/231):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the words “The foot of Islam     cannot be steadfast except on the basis of acceptance without questioning     and of surrendering”:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a metaphor; the physical foot cannot     be steadfast except on some surface. What is meant is that commitment to     Islam cannot be steadfast unless the individual accepts the texts of the     Qur’an and Sunnah and submits to them, without questioning them or opposing     them on the basis of his opinion, rational thinking and analogy. Al-Bukhaari     narrated that Imam Muhammad ibn Shihaab az-Zuhri (may Allah have mercy on     him) said: Allah sends the message and the Messenger conveys it; our role is     to accept and submit. This is a comprehensive and beneficial statement. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Abu’l-Muzaffar as-Sam‘aani (may Allah     have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It should be noted that the criterion that     separates us from everyone who differs from us is the fact that we make the     foundation of our way the Qur’an and Sunnah, and we derive what we derive     from them (of rulings and teachings); anything else we work out within that     framework. We do not think that we should have authority over the principles     of sharee‘ah and alter the rules of Islam so that they become in harmony     with our views, thoughts and ideas. Rather we examine ideas and if we find     them to be in harmony with the fundamentals of Islam as stated in the Qur’an     and Sunnah, we accept them and praise Allah for that. But if we find     ourselves drifting away from the way of the Sunnah and we find ourselves     becoming confused and lost, then we point the finger of suspicion at our own     thinking and ideas; we blame ourselves and admit our helplessness, and we     rein in our reason so that it will not lead us to doom and destruction, or     cause us to drift away from the right path. We surrender to the Qur’an and     Sunnah, and let them lead us. We err on the side of caution and realise that     the words of our predecessors are true: Islam is a bridge that cannot be     crossed except by means of surrendering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Qawaati‘ al-Adillah fi     Usool al-Fiqh, 2/411&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

Narrated by al-Nasaa’i (no. 4219) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.</p>\n<p>They said: The fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered the ‘aqeeqah on behalf of his grandsons al-Hasan and al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them) indicates that it is permissible for the ‘aqeeqah to be done by someone other than the father if it is done with his permission and his consent.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadeeth, “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah, so (the sheep) is to be slaughtered for him on the seventh day, and his headis to be shaved, and he is to be given his name” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 3838; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood):</p>\n<p>The fact that the verb slaughter appears in the passive form that the one who offers the ‘aqeeqah is not specified.

According to the Hanbalis, it is the duty of the father unless he is unable to do that because he is deceased or he refuses to do it.</p>\n<p>Al-Raafa‘i said: In this hadeeth it is as if there may have been a reason why Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered ‘aqeeqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn.</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said: It may be understood as meaning that at that time his parents were poor or he volunteered to do it with the father's permission. Or it may be that he issued instructions that this be done, or it may be one of the things that are unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), just as he offered the udhiyah on behalf of those of his ummah who had not offered the sacrifice. Some of them regarded it as one of the things that were unique to him. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 9/596</p>\n<p>To sum up:</p>\n<p>It is not obligatory for the mother to offer the ‘aqeeqah on behalf of the newborn; rather it is mustahabb for her to do that if the father refuses to do it or if the father is unable to offer the sacrifice because he is far away or he is unaware of the birth and so on, and Allah will record the reward for her.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/71161\">71161</a></p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>With regard to reciting the adhaan in the ear of the newborn, there is no saheeh hadeeth concerning that. Some of the fuqaha’ said that it is mustahabb.</p>\n<p>Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that this action is not mustahabb.</p>\n<p>If we say that it is prescribed to recite the adhaan in the ear of the newborn, as is the view of the Shaafa’is and others, the more correct of the two opinions – in sha Allah – is that it is permissible for a woman, whether it is his mother or another Muslim woman, to do that. This is different from the opinion of those scholars who stipulated that this should be done by a man, as is the case with regard to the adhaan for prayer.</p>\n<p>Al-Shabramalsi al-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words “it is Sunnah to recite the adhaan” mean even if it is done by a woman, because this is not the adhaan that is to be done by men; rather the aim here is simply to mention the name of Allah and seek blessing.</p>\n<p>End quote from his commentary (haashiyah) on Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 8/149.</p>\n<p>This is what it says in Haashyat al-Shuburi ‘ala al-Manhaj, that it is not essential that the person who recites the adhaan in the ear of the newborn should be male. This is supported by the view of some shaykhs, that this Sunnah is fulfilled by the midwife reciting the adhaan in the ear of the newborn.</p>\n<p>End quote from Haashiyat al-Tablaawi ‘ala Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 1/461</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Meaning of the hadith “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him”",
      "question": "<p>What is the meaning of one phrase from this hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will make him feel content with his lot and grant him peace of mind, and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people). Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him”? My question is: what is meant by the words “and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him”? If the hereafter is his main concern, will more of this world be decreed for him, and will this increase be part of what Allah had decreed and foreordained for him? We hope that you can clarify what is meant by this sentence.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2465) from Anas ibn Maalik, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will make him feel content with his lot and grant him peace of mind, and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people). Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will make him fear poverty constantly and confound his affairs, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him.”</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by Ibn Maajah (4105) from Zayd ibn Thaabit, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been written for him. Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will grant him peace of mind and make him feel content with his lot, and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (2/634).</p>\n<p>With regard to the words “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him” – in the second report, “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been written for him” – what is meant is that caring too much and being too eager for worldly gains will not increase a person in benefit, because his provision has already been decreed and written, so nothing will come to him except that which has been decreed and written for him, no matter how much he exerts himself for the sake of worldly gain. So the wise person must be content with seeking worldly provision in ways that are prescribed in Islamic teachings, without being eager for more.</p>\n<p>As-Sindi said in his commentary on Ibn Maajah:</p>\n<p>“and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people)” that is, in spite of circumstances and in spite of those who try to prevent it.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: what has been decreed for a person of provision will inevitably come to him, but if he is one who seeks the hereafter, it will come to him without undue exertion, but whoever seeks worldly gain, it come to him with exertion and hardship. So the one who seeks the hereafter will have both gains in this world and the hereafter. The goal of accumulating wealth is to find ease and comfort in this world, when this is attained by the one who seeks the hereafter, whereas the one who seeks worldly gain will lose out in this world and the hereafter, because in this world he exerts himself greatly in pursuit of worldly gain, so what benefit is there for him in wealth if he fails to attain comfort and ease?&nbsp; End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him” means whether he likes it or not, so he will get nothing of what he was seeking of extra worldly gains, despite his efforts and those of his companions.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (7/140).</p>\n<p>At-Teebi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words “and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people)” are a counterpart to the words “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him.”</p>\n<p>The meaning of the former [regarding the one whose aim is the hereafter] is that what has been decreed for him of worldly gains and provisions will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people).</p>\n<p>The meaning of the latter [regarding the one whose aim is worldly gain] is that what has been decreed for him of worldly gains will come to him regardless of whether he likes it or not.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (11/3372).</p>\n<p>This is clear from the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, fear Allah and be moderate in seeking a living, for no soul will die until it has received all its provision, even if it is slow in coming. So fear Allah and be moderate in seeking provision; take that which is permissible and leave that which is forbidden.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2144); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (6/209).</p>\n<p>What is meant by “be moderate in seeking a living” is: seek provision in a gentle manner, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained what is meant by that, which is to take that which is permissible and leave that which is forbidden.</p>\n<p>See: Fayd al-Qadeer (3/207).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best</p>\n",

      "title": "Are fatwas issued by women valid? Who are the women who were known for  knowledge and issuing fatwas in Islamic history?",
      "question": "<p>Is it valid for women to issue fatwas?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah, may He be exalted, sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, to be a bringer of glad tidings and a warner to all people. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fulfilled the trust and conveyed the message. Among those who heard him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were both women and men. So those who undertook the mission of conveying and teaching Islam were the Sahaabah and those who came after them; their students included both women and men, and the process of learning and teaching was done in accordance with Islamic guidelines, far removed from any haraam mixing, or women uncovering their faces, or speaking softly.</p>\n<p>Islam does not differentiate between men and women with regard to knowledge and issuing fatwas. The scholars have stipulated the conditions to be met by the mufti (scholar who issues fatwas), and they did not mention among these conditions that the mufti must be male. No difference of scholarly opinion is known concerning that.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The conditions to be met by the mufti are that he should be accountable, Muslim, trustworthy, honest, far removed from evildoing and from actions that could cast aspersions on his [or her] integrity, have an innate ability to grasp the meanings of things, be clear-minded and mature in thinking, of sound understanding and able to reach sound conclusions, and alert. This applies equally to one who is free, a slave, a woman, one who is blind, and one who is nonverbal, if he or she can write or his or her gestures can be understood. End quote.&nbsp;<em>Al-Majmoo‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab</em> (1/41).</p>\n<p>Among this great ummah there were women who undertook the duty of teaching and issuing fatwas, just as men did.</p>\n<p>Yes, the number of women cannot be compared to that of men, because of the nature of man, but this does not mean that there were not women who undertook the mission of teaching and issuing fatwas. Foremost among those women was the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Both men and women would seek her out to ask for fatwas, because she had been so close to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and because of her intelligence and smartness.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in <em>al-Isti‘aab</em> (p. 609):</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Masrooq said: I saw some of the elderly senior companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asking her about issues pertaining to the shares of inheritance.</p>\n<p>‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah said: ‘Aa’ishah was the most knowledgeable of the people and had the greatest understanding of religion.</p>\n<p>Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah said, narrating from his father: I never saw anyone who was more knowledgeable of fiqh, medicine or poetry than ‘Aa’ishah.</p>\n<p>Az-Zuhri said: If the knowledge of ‘Aa’ishah was compared to the knowledge of all the other wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the knowledge of all women put together, the knowledge of ‘Aa’ishah would surpass them all. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) listed those of the Sahaabah who issued many fatwas, among whom he mentioned ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). He listed Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) as one of those who issued a middling number of fatwas; and he listed Umm ‘Atiyyah, Safiyyah the Mother of the Believers, Hafsah and Umm Habeebah as being among those who issued a small number of fatwas.</p>\n<p>See: <em>I‘laam al-Muwaqqi‘een</em> (1/12, 13).</p>\n<p>We will list here some of the women whom Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) described as having knowledge and understanding of religion in his book <em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em>, in confirmation of what we have mentioned above.</p>\n<p>1.. Safiyyah bint Shaybah.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Safiyyah bint Shaybah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn Abi Talhah, the faqeehah and ‘aalimah (scholar).</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (3/507, 508).</p>\n<p>2.. Umm ad-Darda’.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Umm ad-Darda’, the lady, the ‘aalimah, the faqeehah. She is Umm ad-Darda’ as-Sughra (the Younger).</p>\n<p>She narrated a great deal of knowledge from her husband Abu’d-Darda’, and from Salmaan al-Faarisi, Ka‘b ibn ‘Aasim al-Ash‘ari, ‘Aa’ishah, Abu Hurayrah and a number of others.</p>\n<p>She recited the entire Qur’an to Abu’d-Darda’ when she was very young.</p>\n<p>She lived a long life, and was famous for her knowledge, good deeds and asceticism (<em>zuhd</em>).</p>\n<p>Mak-hool said: Umm ad-Darda’ was a faqeehah.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (4/277, 278).</p>\n<p>3.. Mu‘aadhah al-‘Adawiyyah (d. 83 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Mu‘aadhah bint ‘Abdillah. The lady, ‘aalimah, mother of as-Sahba’ al-‘Adawiyyah al-Basriyyah, devoted worshipper, wife of the leading example Silah ibn Ashyam.</p>\n<p>She narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, ‘Aa’ishah and Hishaam ibn ‘Aamir.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (4/508, 509).</p>\n<p>4.. Bint al-Mihaamili (d. 377 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The scholar, faqeehah, mufti, Amat al-Waahid bint al-Husayn ibn Ismaa‘eel.</p>\n<p>She was taught by her father and narrated from him, and also from Ismaa‘eel al-Warraaq and ‘Abd al-Ghaafir al-Homsi. She memorized the Qur’an and the fiqh of ash-Shaafa‘i. She was well versed in shares of inheritance, Arabic language, and other subjects.</p>\n<p>Al-Burqaani said: She used to issue fatwas with Abu ‘Ali ibn Abi Hurayrah.</p>\n<p>Someone else said: She was one of the most well versed of people in fiqh.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (15/264).</p>\n<p>5.. Kareemah bint Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Haatim Umm al-Kiraam al-Marzawiyyah (d. 463 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The shaykhah, ‘aalimah, woman of virtue, narrator of hadith, Umm al-Kiraam.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (18/233, 234).</p>\n<p>6.. ‘Aa’ishah bint Hasan bin Ibraaheem (d. 460 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The preacher, ‘aalimah, narrator of hadith, Umm al-Fath al-Asbahaaniyyah al-Warkaaniyyah.</p>\n<p>Ibn as-Sam‘aani said: I asked al-Haafiz Ismaa‘eel about her, and he said: A righteous woman, a scholar who exhorts the women.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (18/302).</p>\n<p>7. Faatimah ad-Daqqaaq (d. 480 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Faatimah bint al-Ustaadh az-Zaahid Abu ‘Ali, al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali ad-Daqqaaq, the shaykhah, devoted worshipper, ‘aalimah, Umm al-Baneen an-Naysabooriyyah, wife of al-Ustadh Abu’l-Qaasim al -Qushayri and mother of his children.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (18/479, 480).</p>\n<p>8. Bint Za‘bah (d. 532 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The shaykhah, ‘aalimah, reciter of Qur’an, righteous woman, long-lived, the famous hadith narrator of&nbsp; Naysaboor (Nishapur), Umm al-Khayr, Faatimah bint ‘Ali ibn Muzaffar ibn al-Hasan ibn Za‘bal ibn ‘Ijlaan al-Baghdaadi thumma an-Naysabooriyyah.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (19/625).</p>\n<p>9.. Faatimah bint al-Baghdaadi (d. 539 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The shaykhah, ‘aalimah, preacher, righteous woman, long-lived, the famous hadith narrator of Isfahan, Umm al-Baha’, Faatimah bint Muhammad ibn Abi Sa‘d Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali ibn al-Baghdaadi al-Asbahaani.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (20/148).</p>\n<p>This is a list of virtuous women who were scholars and muftis. Islam does not prevent any person of knowledge, man or woman, from issuing fatwas and teaching people the religion of Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>We should point out that there is a difference between being a mufti and being a qaadi (judge). Issuing a fatwa is informing people of the sh ar ‘i ruling, and no one is to be prevented from doing that if he or she is qualified to do it. As for being a qaadi, the evidence of the religious texts, and the practice of the Muslim ummah, indicate that a woman cannot be appointed as a qaadi.

      "question": "<p>I have a very important question, which I hope you can answer. My father has a store in which he sells cards for public telephones. Every time I needed a card I used to tell my father or my mother that I was going to take a card from the store and they would let me do that. But there came a time when I needed a card nearly every day. And I would take a card with the knowledge of the clerk who was working in the store, but I did not tell my father or mother, because I felt that they would never agree to that. When I realized how wrong this was, I never took anything without their knowledge after that. I regretted what I had done and repented to Allaah. Is repentance enough or do I have to tell them what I was doing? Or can I at least take part of my own money and give it to them without them knowing that it was me who gave them this money, because I cannot tell them openly? Can I give them the money until I have paid off what I took, knowing that I do not know the true amount I took because I took so many cards?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We hope that when you used a lot of these cards it was for     good and permissible purposes, because if it was used for the opposite then     your using them will be compounded by other sins too, so you should pay     attention to this fact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As you have acknowledged that you were wrong to take these     cards without your parents’ permission, you have to repent from doing that –     praise be to Allaah Who has guided you to repent and regret your actions.     But you should understand that there are conditions for repentance, which is     not valid unless they are met. These conditions include: immediately giving     up the forbidden action, resolving not to go back to it, and restoring     people’s rightful property or seeking their forgiveness. You do not have to     tell your father what you did, rather what you have to do is to return the     money in whatever way you can. You should try hard to figure out the value     of the cards you took without your father’s permission, and give this money     to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to accept your repentance and to guide you to     do righteous deeds.

      "question": "<p>Is it haraam to open a business which caters for weddings, birthdays, christmas parties etc. to cater for any christian festivities?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      It is haraam to start this business, because these celebrations that you       mentioned in the question are haraam, either because of their origins or       because of the evils involved in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to parties for Christian festivals, such as Christmas, New Year     and other Christian celebrations, it is haraam for the Muslim to hold such     celebrations or participate in them. This has been explained in fatwas no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/50074\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">50074</a> and <a href=\"/en/answers/175577\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">175577</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Therefore they are celebrations that are haraam because of their origins;     moreover, they are not free of evils in the way they are celebrated. If     something is haraam or involves prohibited actions, it is haraam to help     others with it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of     the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue,     righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and     transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:2].</p>\n<p>    With regard to Christian wedding parties, they are not haraam because of     their origins per se, but they will never be free of prohibited matters such     as free mixing, wanton display, singing, music and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So     they come under the same rulings as the parties mentioned above. Therefore     it is not allowed to take part in them, because what is required of the     Muslim is to denounce these evils and not participate in them or approve of     them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It     was narrated that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:     “Whoever among you sees an evil action,     then let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then     with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart –     and that is the weakest of faith.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Muslim (78).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the    truth when he said, I am not leaving behind any fitnah (trial, temptation) more    harmful to men than women. </p>\n<p>(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4706).    </p>\n<p>He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also    said: This world is sweet and dazzling, and Allaah has you put in charge of it to    see how you will do and what you will do, so beware of this world and beware of women, for    the first fitnah (temptation, trial) that befell the Children of Israel was concerning    women. </p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim, 4925).    </p>\n<p>You have to deal with two things, one now and one in the    future. As far as your past misbehaviour is concerned, you must repent sincerely to Allaah    right now, and do good deeds to expiate for your bad deeds, as was reported in the hadeeth    of Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that a man kissed a woman    [who was unlawful for him]; he came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be    upon him) and told him about it, [saying, I met a woman in the garden, and I    embraced her, touched her and kissed her]. [Here I am, judge concerning me as you    wish.] [He started asking how he could expiate for this, and (the Prophet     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) did not say anything]. Then Allaah revealed    the words (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends    of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil    deeds [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, O Messenger of Allaah, is this    just for me? He said, It is for all of my ummah </p>\n<p>(reported by    al-Bukhaari, 495; additional material in brackets is from the reports of al-Tirmidhi,    Ahmad, Muslim and Ibn Maajah, in that order), so do a lot of acts of    worship and good deeds, so that Allaah may accept your repentance.     </p>\n<p>As far as the future is concerned, you are not permitted at all to go    to places where there is corruption and free mixing, where you are likely to meet women.    You say that you cannot control yourself, so why do you go to places where you spend time    chatting informally with women, and then say that you cannot resist? What you say is    completely unacceptable. If you avoid the places and things that lead to evil, and do not    expose yourself to it, you will protect yourself from falling into sin. Fear Allaah, for    Allaah is watching you to see how you will do and what you will do. Beware of going to    places that will lead you into haraam things. Remember that the more you indulge in haraam    activities, the more difficult it is to retreat, so nip it in the bud. Stick to righteous    company, and keep away from evil things and evil people. Do everything that will help you    to remain chaste, such as hastening to marry and lowering your gaze. I ask Allaah to    protect you from the temptation of women. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n",

      "title": "He wants to marry her but she does not wear niqaab. Should he go ahead and propose or should he look for someone else?",
      "question": "<p>I am a young Arab man who lives according to our Arab traditions, or what is known as a good attitude and etiquette, but this commitment has nothing to do with adhering to Islamic teachings, because in our country adhering to tradition does not contradict listening to music, mixing, dealing with riba-based banks and so on. I proposed marriage to a girl in the same environment that I am living in, and her family have been friends of my family for a long time. They all approved of the marriage since they know that we are both of good character. But my problem, unfortunately, started when I began to read about the rules on marriage in Islam and I started to reduce mixing and to pray regularly in the mosque and let my beard grow and not deal with riba-based banks and not listen to music and so on. Now both families are regarding me as an extremist, except those on whom Allaah has mercy, and they started to make this girl afraid of me, even though she loves me very much and has told them all about that many times. The girl wants to be committed but she is not able to do some things such as wearing niqaab or covering the face. So she too regards these things as signs of extremism in religion, as her family do. <br />\nShould I forget about this girl who is of good character and proper etiquette and who is keen to pray and recite the adhkaar of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is trying to be committed, and who loves me and tells others of that, and does not want to lose me, but she is unable to do some things that have to do with religion, such as covering her face, and look for someone else who is committed but whose family and behaviour I do not know and my judgement of her will be only according to what I hear from those who know her family and behaviour?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We ask Allaah the Almighty to make us and you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to bless us and you with more obedience and righteousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what you are asking about, it is better for you to stay with this girl towards whom your heart is inclined, and who feels likewise about you, and who has no faults that would cause you to leave her. All that there is, is that she needs a little care and encouragement and sound Islamic education to accept and follow the commands of Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A lot of that may come after marriage, especially if you treat her nicely and move her into a better environment than the one she is in, which is what we advise and encourage you to do. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no reason why a woman who loves her religion and is obedient to her husband should not respond to the command of Allaah as regards her clothing, especially since this will make her husband love and respect her more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Her refusal to wear niqaab may be because of the lies fabricated by some of those who are ignorant and who follow their own whims and desires, who say that the niqaab is a custom inherited from the Jaahiliyyah and that it was not brought by Islam. You should explain to her the ruling on a woman covering her face, with evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and tell her that the scholars are unanimously agreed that this ruling is prescribed in Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remind her of the Sahaabi women who hastened to tear their aprons so that they could cover their faces after the verse of hijab was revealed, and encourage her to have righteous friends. Tell her that this world is transient and soon each of us will meet our Lord with our deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Neither you nor she should worry about what your families will say. As for such environments where the rulings of Islam are not known and people cannot differentiate between proper adherence to Islam and extremism no attention should be paid to them or to what they say about one who adheres to the path of righteousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your wife does not respond to the Islamic injunction to cover the face, then be patient with her, and try to convey the message to her in some other way, such as from another women who is involved in da’wah, or by means of tapes and books by scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seek the help of Allaah and persist in calling upon Him, asking Him for support and help to establish a household based on what our Lord loves and is pleased with.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Show her the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21134\">21134</a>, which speaks of the obligation to wear niqaab according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And please see question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20343\">20343</a> which speaks of the husband’s duty to advise his wife and how he may do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.</p>\n",

Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. I received your letter telling me that you are 23 years old and that you are a Shi’a and a follower of Dawood Bohra, and that the representative of the leader of that group [the Bohra Shi’a] in Kenya is not allowing the official licensed to perform marriages in Mombasa to do your marriage contract, and you want to know the Islamic ruling on that.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There           is no doubt that the people in authority of all groups that claim to           be Muslim are obliged to adhere to the rulings of Islam in all affairs,           and that they should beware of anything that goes against that. It is           known in Islamic sharee’ah that guardians are obliged to arrange the           marriages of girls under their care if someone compatible proposes marriage,           because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And           marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and           the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious,           fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid servants (female           slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.           And Allaah is All Sufficent for His creatures’ needs, All Knowing (about           the state of the people).”</p>\n<p>[al-Noor           24:32]</p>\n<p>And it was narrated that the Prophet                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to           you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased,           then marry [your female relative under your care] to him, for if you           do not do that then there will be fitnah (tribulation) on earth and           much mischief.” (Narrated by Imaam al-Tirmdihi and others).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Based           on that, then if one of your guardians who is related to you arranges           your married to a compatible person, the representative of the Bohra           group has no right to object to that, and the marriage will be valid,           so long as the conditions of marriage are fulfilled. That should be           done through the sharee’ah court in Mombasa so that no objections can           be raised by the representative of the Bohra group. If the marriage           is done in the manner mentioned, then your children will be legitimate           and neither the Bohra group nor anybody else will be able to deny that.           If your relatives refuse to marry you to one who is compatible in order           to please the representative of the Bohra group, then their guardianship           becomes invalid thereby, and the Muslim judge (qaadi) has the right           to do the marriage contract for you with the compatible person who has           proposed marriage to you, because the Prophet                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The ruler is the           wali for the one who has no wali.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The           qaadi is the deputy of the ruler and takes his place in such matters,           and if the wali (guardian) is refusing to arrange the girl’s marriage,           the ruling on him is the same as if he was not there at all. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;But           we advise you and others in your position to forsake the Bohra madhhab           and other Shi’a madhhabs, because they go against the Islamic way of           Muhammad                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in many ways. So you have           to leave them and join the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah who           follow that which is dictated by the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the way           of the early generations of this ummah, the Companions of the Messenger                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who follow them           in truth. I ask Allaah to guide this group and other groups which have           gone astray from the right path, and to show them the path of truth.           May He help you and us and all the Muslims to do that which will lead           to salvation and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, for He           is the One Who is able to do that. Peace be upon you and the mercy and           blessings of Allaah.</p>\n",

End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After researching the reports about the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), we could not find the hadeeth mentioned by the questioner in this version, but there are ahaadeeth about the Angel of Death asking the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission, in wording similar to that mentioned by the questioner. But these are weak (da’eef) ahaadeeth which the scholars judged to be false and fabricated. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a hadeeth narrated by ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn from his father, telling a long story in which the Angel of Death asks for permission to enter upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and speaks with him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This story was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer (3/129) and in Kitaab al-Du’aa’ (1/367).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (9/35): Its isnaad includes ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Maymoon al-Qaddaah, whose reports are worthless.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was also judged as such by al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (4/560); al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Ajwabah Ba’d Talaameedhatihi (1/87) and Ibn Katheer in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (5/290). Al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (5384): it is mawdoo’ (fabricated).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is another hadeeth which was narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which it mentions the Angel of death seeking permission to enter upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during his final illness. This was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer (12/141).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al_Zawaa’id (9/36): its isnaad includes al-Mukhtaar ibn Naafi’, who is da’eef (weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-‘Iraaqi said in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (4/560): It isnaad includes al-Mukhtaari ibn Naafi’, whose hadeeth is rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) being given the choice between death and staying in this world, and his saying, “Rather the Higher Companion,” this is proven in al-Saheehayn in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), which is quoted in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45841\">45841</a>, q.v.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the story of the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): it is mentioned in some books of history that the Angel of Death came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the form of a Bedouin and asked for permission to enter upon him. How true is this?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is not correct. The Angel of Death did not come to him or ask permission to enter upon him, rather the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delivered a speech at the end of his life in which he said: “Allaah has given a slave the choice between immortality in this world for as long as Allaah wills, or meeting his Lord, and he has chosen to meet his Lord.” This is what he said at the end of his life. Abu Bakr wept, and the people were surprised that Abu Bakr wept at these words. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the one who was given the choice, and Abu Bakr knew the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) better than any of the people. This is what has been narrated. As for the idea that the Angel of Death came to him and asked him for permission, this is not correct.

      "question": "<p>I want to find out when my mother’s ‘iddah will end. My father (may Allah have mercy on him – I hope that you will pray for mercy and forgiveness for him) died on Friday 6/4/2012.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to have mercy on your father and forgive him, and to have mercy on all the deceased Muslims, for He is All-Hearing, All-Responsive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman’s husband dies, if she is pregnant her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens)” [at-Talaaq 65:4].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If she is not pregnant, then her ‘iddah is four months and ten days, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days” [al-Baqarah 2:234].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The woman whose husband has died must observe ‘iddah following the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar, because the Islamic rulings are based on lunar months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Months are to be counted by new moons if the husband died at the beginning of the month. If some months are thirty days and others are twenty-nine days, then the counting is still correct and the woman in ‘iddah does not have to make up any of the days from the months that were twenty-nine days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (29/315-316): Counting the months of the ‘iddah in the event of divorce, annulment or death of the husband, is to be based on the lunar, not solar, calendar. If the divorce or death occurred at the beginning of the month, then the months are to be counted by the new moons, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: “They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage” [al-Baqarah 2:189], even if that falls short by a few days, because Allah has commanded us to observe ‘iddah by the months. He, may He be glorified, says: “their Iddah (prescribed period) is three months” [at-Talaaq 65:4] and&nbsp; “four months and ten days” [al-Baqarah 2:234]. So attention must be paid to the months, whether they are thirty days or less. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he died during the month – as in the case mentioned in the question – then she should observe ‘iddah for the remainder of the first months and for three months thereafter, with their new moons, whether they are twenty-nine or thirty days, plus ten days, then she should add whatever she missed of the first month. There are two ways to work out what she missed of the first month&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.She may regard the first month as thirty days, whether the month in which the event occurred was thirty or twenty-nine days, and if she observed ‘iddah for twenty days of that month, she should complete ten more days in the fifth month, and so on.</p>\n<p>2.She may observe ‘iddah in the fifth month for a number of days equal to what she missed of the first month, whether the month was thirty days or twenty-nine days.</p>\n<p>See: al-Mughni, 8/85; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘, 5/418; al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 29/315&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on the above, if the ‘iddah began on 6/4/2012 (6 April 2012), which corresponds to 14 Jumaada al-Oola 1433, then the ‘iddah ends on 24 Ramadan 1433, which corresponds to 12 August 2012. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>I am a 19 year old muslim brother. I want to marry a girl.</div>\n<div>I've asked her and she's agreed. The problem is that once were married she wants to go to university. But I go to uni myself and its an extremely un-islaamic environment where boys and girls mix freely, people walk around half naked, people drinking alcohol, swearing, and where there</div>\n<div>is very little morality. She wants to go to uni because she doesen't want to let her mother down because her mother has told her cousins that her dauhgter will get a degree but if she doesn't go to uni her cousins will say to her mother that I stopped her from getting a degree. What should she do. Should she go to uni where its a corrupt envornment just to keep her mother happy or not go to uni?</div>\n<div>Also after I get my degree and a couple of years working experience I want to leave this corrupt country and go to an islaamic country. I had afghanistan at the topp of my list. Is this a good idea? If not where else can I go?</div>\n<div>Thank you for any help you can give me</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the situation in the university is as you describe, then it is not permissible for her to study in that place or to go there. One of the well-known basic principles of shareeah is that there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. She should not obey her mother in this instance. She should try to convince her mother that it is haraam, by explaining to her gently and politely, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>But if they [parents] strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly [Luqmaan 31:15].</p>\n<p>If the mother does not accept this, it is still not permissible for the daughter to obey her and there will be no sin on her for that, in sha Allaah.</p>\n<p>But there is another important point we must make here:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for you to talk to this girl or to sit with her before marriage. The Prophet said: Beware of entering upon women and No man is alone with a woman, but the Shaytaan is the third one present. So beware of doing that.</p>\n<p>As for your travelling to settle in a Muslim country: look for a land where you can openly practise the rituals of Islam and where you will feel safe to practise your religion and not feel in any danger, where the environment will help you to worship your Lord properly and where there is less fitnah (temptation). Allaah is the source of help and He is the Guide, there is no god besides Him.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I work as a sales agent of a company. My job is to market and display goods that might be already available in all the shops I visit. Some of these shops have already contracted with other agents about similar goods. Is offering lower price for the same goods, in order to compete with the other agent, haram and considered outbidding my brother? Although this is the reality of working as sales agents in any company.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Al-Bukhaari (5142) and Muslim (1412) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should undersell his brother.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (1408) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “and he should not outbid his brother.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars have described the situation to which this prohibition applies. They said: With regard to the seller and the buyer, one of the following three scenarios must apply:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-1-</p>\n<p>Where they start bargaining and each party tries to make a deal with the other, and neither of them seems to be accepting the other’s offer yet. At this stage the bidding begins, if the seller has offered his product for auction, or there may be a process of underselling, if the buyer wants to see who will offer him the cheapest price in public bidding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At this stage there is nothing wrong with outbidding or underselling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-2-</p>\n<p>When both the buyer and the seller have come to an agreement and they have decided to complete the transaction. Then it is not permissible for anyone else to interfere by offering to buy or sell or any kind of bargaining. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-3-</p>\n<p>When the deal has been struck and the transaction has become binding, but there remains the option of cancelling it, either because they have not yet parted or because that option has been stipulated in the deal (whereby one or both parties have stipulated that they have the right to cancel the deal within a certain period). In that case it is not permissible for anyone to interfere and try to sell for less or buy for more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-4-</p>\n<p>If the deal has been struck between the two parties and the option of annulling is no longer available because they have parted or they did not stipulate the option of annulling, then some scholars are of the view that there is no sin on the one who intervenes between them and offers them something better. This is the view of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, based on the evidence of a report narrated by al-Nasaa’i (4504) of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar in which it says: “No one should undersell his brother until the deal has been done or cancelled.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not forbid two men before they enter into a transaction or after they depart from the place in which they did the transaction from selling whatever they want, because that is not outbidding someone else which is forbidden. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Umm (3/92).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars favoured the view that it is haraam to undersell one's brother in this manner, i.e., even after the sale has become binding and it is not possible to cancel it, because the buyer may use trickery to cancel the sale, or that may lead him to a dispute between him and the first seller because he thinks that he could have gotten that product for a lower price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: This is the view of a number of our companions, and it is more likely to be correct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi also inclined towards this view in al-Insaaf (11/178).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also viewed as more correct by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him). He said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (8/204):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This view is the correct one, i.e., that underselling one's brother is haraam, whether that is at the time when they still have the option to cancel the deal or after that. But if it happens a long time afterwards, there is nothing wrong with it. i.e., if that happens before a week or a month or the like, and he comes and says: I will give you a similar product for nine, when he had bought it for ten, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is not possible to cancel the deal at that stage. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What the sales agent should do is pay attention to the rulings and cases mentioned above, so that he will not do wrong things or commit sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he knows that the shopkeeper has decided to buy from another company, then it is not permissible for him to offer his goods to him in that case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he does not know anything – as is usually the case for most sales agents – then there is nothing wrong with him offering his products for whatever price he wants, and there is no sin in that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The refusal of ‘Umar and those who were with him to bring writing materials to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) during his illness",
      "question": "<p>One of my Shi‘i friends says that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them) disobeyed the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was on his deathbed. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked the Sahaabah at that time to bring a piece of paper and a pen, but they both refused to bring them. According to what the Shi‘ah say, the Sahaabah went astray after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) left instructions that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was to be the caliph after his death. They have proven that to me by quoting the hadith which says that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) disobeyed Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and anger could be seen on the Prophet’s face. I want to say that this friend of mine has influenced one of my friends, who do not have any information about Islam. Can you explain to me why ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) disobeyed the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? Can you also tell me how to deal with such people? I hope you can give me references. Thank you very much.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for you to make friends with any one from this group who claim to be Muslim, then they cast aspersions on the basic teachings of Islam and on those who conveyed the religion to people (i.e., the Sahaabah), and who believe that the Quran has been distorted, and that people can be infallible, and they regard the Sahaabah as apostates, apart from a few of them.</p>\n<p>What you must do with regard to these people and others like them is shun them, and warn others about their evil and misguidance.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/91665\">91665</a> and&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96231\">96231</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The wording of the hadith which speaks of the story which that Raafidi mentioned to you is as follows:</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was dying, there were men in the house among whom was ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Come, let me write for you a document after which you will not go astray.” ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is overcome with pain, and you have the Quran; the Book of Allah is sufficient for us. The people in the house disagreed, and they argued. Some of them said: Come close and let the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) write for you a document after which you will not go astray. Others agreed with what ‘Umar said. When their debating and argument in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) became too much, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Get up and leave.”</p>\n<p>‘Ubayd-Allah said: Ibn ‘Abbaas used to say: What a calamity it was when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was prevented from writing that document for them because of their disagreement and arguing.</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6932) and Muslim (1637)</p>\n<p>-1-</p>\n<p>the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed his companions who were present with him during his illness to bring a piece of paper and a pen, so that he could dictate to them something that had nothing to do with a new revelation that he had not yet conveyed to the people, or with any shar‘i instruction that the people needed that had to do with their religion. Then he decided not to tell them about that matter, because of what happened. The evidence for that is as follows:</p>\n<p>(a)This incident happened on a Thursday, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died on the following Monday, i.e., four days later. He could have asked others to write that document, but because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that, we know that it was not revelation that he could have concealed.</p>\n<p>(b)Allah, may He be exalted, praised His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for having conveyed what He revealed to him, and Allah, may He be exalted, reminded this ummah of the blessing that He had bestowed upon them by perfecting their religion and completing His favour upon them. The idea that what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not write was part of the religion that all of the ummah needs is tantamount to accusing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of not conveying the message, and it constitutes disbelief in what the Lord, may He be exalted, said about the religion being perfected and His blessing being completed upon His slaves.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The writing of this document is not something that Allah enjoined upon him to write or convey at that time. If that had been the case, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not have failed to do what Allah instructed him to do.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/315, 316)</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It was not permissible for him to abandon writing the document because of the doubts that some had about (its importance). If what he intended to write in the document was something that he was obliged to convey and disclose, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have disclosed it and written it in a document, and he would not have paid any attention to the view of anybody, for he was the most obedient of creation to Allah. Thus it is known that when he decided not to write the document, the document was not obligatory and it would not have contained anything of religious matters that he was obliged to write at that time, because if that had been necessary, he would have done it.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/12)</p>\n<p>(c)What we have mentioned is supported by the fact that the Sahaabah who were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) differed with regard to their understanding of his instruction to bring writing materials and what he really intended. Otherwise they would all have hastened to fulfil his instructions. It was proven from them that they took off their shoes during the prayer because of merely seeing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) take off his shoes during the prayer, without him instructing them to do that, so would such people have gone against an instruction if they believed it to be part of the revelation? They are far above doing such a thing. Therefore, some of them got up to bring a piece of paper and a pen, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had asked them to do, and others refrained, thinking that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) may have been overwhelmed with pain, or that his instruction was meant as a recommendation only.</p>\n<p>Abu’l-‘Abbaas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to the words “Come, let me write for you a document after which you will not go astray”, this is a command and a request that was addressed to everyone present. Hence it was the duty of everyone who was present to hasten to obey this command, especially when it was followed by the words “after which you will not go astray”. But ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and others thought that this command was not by way of obligation; rather it was by way of recommendation. Moreover, in the Book of Allah there is guidance to everything that the Muslim needs, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have sent down to you the Book (the Quran) as an exposition of everything” [an-Nahl 16:89]. In addition to that, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was suffering pain, so ‘Umar did not want him to have to do something that may be very difficult for him in that situation. Therefore they decided that it was more appropriate for him not to write anything. But the other group wanted him to write the document, following the apparent meaning of the command and out of eagerness for more clarification and to remove any ambiguity. Would that that had happened! But that is what Allah decreed, and whatever He wills happens. But there should be no blame or criticism of the first group, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not rebuke them or tell them off; rather he said to all of them: “Let me be, for I am fine.”</p>\n<p>Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhees Kitaab Muslim (15/18)</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Al-Maaziri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was permissible for the Sahaabah to differ concerning this document, despite the clear instructions given to them concerning that, because instructions may be accompanied by indications that make them less than obligatory. It is as if there was something to indicate that the matter was not obligatory; rather it was optional. Therefore they had different views, and ‘Umar insisted on his view for which he had circumstantial evidence that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had said that without insisting on it.</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (8/133, 134)</p>\n<p>-2-</p>\n<p>The Prophet’s decision to write a document was either based on revelation that came then was abrogated, or it was something that he thought would serve some interest, then he changed his mind.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) thought about writing the document when he thought that it would serve some interest, or it may be that he received some revelation concerning that, then it appeared that best interests would be served by refraining from writing it, or he received revelation to abrogate the initial command.</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/90). A similar report was narrated by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar from al-Maaziri. See: Fath al-Baari (8/134).</p>\n<p>-3-</p>\n<p>The Raafidis claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave instructions that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) should become caliph after he died, but what does this incident have to do with them? Why do they have to tamper with it and misinterpret it, claiming that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to write down instructions that ‘Ali should become the caliph after him? Why couldn’t the instructions that he wanted to write in this document be instructions for Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to become caliph after he died?</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Whoever imagines that this document would have been about the appointment of ‘Ali to the caliphate is misguided, according to the consensus of the Muslims, including the scholars of both the Sunnis and the Shi‘ah. As for the Sunnis, they are unanimously agreed that Abu Bakr is superior and is to be given precedence. As for the Shi‘ah who say that ‘Ali was the one who deserved to be the imam (caliph), they say that ‘Ali had been named as the imam (caliph) before that, in clear and unambiguous wording that was widely known. In that case, there was no need for any document.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/11)</p>\n<p>-4-</p>\n<p>It is proven via the soundest isnaad that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to give instructions that Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) should be appointed caliph after he died, then he decided not to do that, and he said that the believers would not accept anyone other than him as caliph. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me during his illness: “I was thinking – or I wanted – to send for Abu Bakr and his son and appoint him as my successor, lest people say (that the caliphate should be for So and so) or lest anyone should hope for it for themselves. Then I thought: Allah and the believers would reject anyone who is less qualified than Abu Bakr.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5342). Also narrated by Muslim (2387) with the words: “when Allah and the believers insist on Abu Bakr.”</p>\n<p>We (as Sunnis) are not concerned about that issue, because Allah and the believers decided that the successor (caliph) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should be no one but Abu Bakr.</p>\n<p>-5-</p>\n<p>What occurred of some of the Sahaabah questioning the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about some issues does not undermine the fact that they would hasten to follow his instructions and do what Islam required, because they would discuss things with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the revelation came confirming what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told them, whereupon they would hasten to obey the command.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Al-Khattaabi said: The companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would discuss some issues with him before he gave them definitive and binding instructions, as when they discussed the terms of the treaty between him and Quraysh with him on the day of al-Hudaybiyah. But once he issued definitive instructions, none of them would discuss it with him.</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/91)</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Sahaabah used to discuss some issues with him, so long as he had not issued definitive instructions; once he did that, however, they would comply with them.</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (1/209)</p>\n<p>-6-</p>\n<p>The words of ‘Umar, “the Book of Allah is sufficient for us”, were not addressed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for ‘Umar was too respectful to have done that. Rather these words were addressed to those who objected to him not bringing writing materials.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words of ‘Umar, “the Book of Allah is sufficient for us”, were answering back those who disagreed with him; it was not a counter-argument to the instruction of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/93).</p>\n<p>-7-</p>\n<p>The scholars gave the following reasons to explain why ‘Umar thought it better not to bring materials with which to write the document for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):</p>\n<p>(a)His compassion for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he did not want to burden him in that situation with having to dictate the document, because that might be too difficult for him, as he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is overcome with pain.</p>\n<p>(b)He was worried lest the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was sickness would cast aspersions on this document and express their doubts about those who transmitted it, and cast aspersions on them and their good character.</p>\n<p>(c)He was worried that he may write some instructions that they would not be able to comply with, and thus they would incur sin by not complying, and he thought it was kinder to the ummah, with regard to these issues, to leave them as a matter of ijtihaad, to be subject to examination and looking for the right answer, so that both the one who gets it right and the one who gets it wrong would be rewarded.</p>\n<p>See: Dalaa’il an-Nubuwwah (7/184); ash-Shifa bi Ta‘reef Huqooq al-Mustafa by al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (2/194); Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (11/91); Fath al-Baari (1/209)</p>\n<p>-8-</p>\n<p>With regard to the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), there is nothing in them to suggest that he was casting aspersions on the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). He was among those who swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, and to ‘Umar al-Faarooq after him. What he meant was that the thing that prevented writing down the document (i.e., the Prophet’s sickness) was itself a calamity, because turmoil emerged after that and aspersions were cast on those prominent Sahaabah.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words of Ibn ‘Abbaas, “What a calamity it was when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was prevented from writing that document” mean that the thing that prevented it happening was a calamity; it was a calamity for those who doubted the legitimacy of Abu Bakr’s caliphate, or were not certain about the matter, because if there had been a document, there would have been no doubt. As for those who knew that his caliphate was legitimate, it was not a calamity for them, praise be to Allah.</p>\n<p>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (6/11)</p>\n<p>-10-</p>\n<p>These words of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) were based on his own ijtihaad. No doubt ‘Umar was more knowledgeable and was senior to Ibn ‘Abbaas. Some of the scholars are of the view that the fact that the document was not written, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not object to what ‘Umar said, suggests that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) adopted ‘Umar’s opinion and thought that that was the correct thing to do.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Therefore ‘Umar was more knowledgeable than Ibn ‘Abbaas and the people who agreed with him.</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (11/90)</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not object to ‘Umar indicates that he thought his view was correct. When ‘Umar said, “the Book of Allah is sufficient for us”, he was referring to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “We have neglected nothing in the Book” [al-An‘aam 6:38]. It may be that the aim was to make things easier for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when ‘Umar saw that he was in great distress. Thus he sensed that what he wanted to write was not something they could not do without. If that had been the case, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not have refrained from writing it because of their differences.</p>\n<p>This view cannot be undermined by what Ibn ‘Abbaas said, “What a calamity it was…”, because ‘Umar was definitely more knowledgeable than him.</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (8/134).</p>\n<p>Thus it becomes clear that the claims of the Raafidis, casting aspersions on the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) – and especially ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) – are false. It also becomes clear that what the early generations said about them being the most mendacious of the groups that claim to be Muslims is true. So beware of them for the sake of your religious commitment. We ask Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to Islam and the Sunnah.</p>\n<p>For more information on the beliefs of the Raafidis, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/4569\">4569</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1148\">1148</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21500\">21500&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What do the scholars say about the soundness of these mawqoof hadiths that were narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah?</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr told us: Jareer told us, from Mugheerah, from Abu Waa’il and Ibraaheem, who said: When the Muslims came, they got some food from the Magians, their cheese and bread, and they ate and did not ask about that. The cheese was described to ‘Umar, and he said: Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr told us: Abu Mu‘aawiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Shaqeeq, from ‘Amr ibn Shurahbeel, who said: We mentioned cheese in the presence of ‘Umar, and we told him that it was made with rennet of animals that died of natural causes, and he said: Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr told us: Wakee‘ told us, from Sufyaan, from Jahsh, from Mu‘aawiyah ibn Qurrah, from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali that he was asked about cheese and said: There is nothing wrong with it, mention the name of Allah over it as you are cutting it, and eat. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>With regard to the first isnaad, its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), the men of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, but Mugheerah – whose full name is Mugheerah ibn Miqsam ad-Dabbi – is mudallis [i.e., he engaged in tadlees, which is when a narrator narrates a hadith that he did not hear directly from his shaykh, without mentioning the name of the third party from whom he did hear it, using wording that may or may not give the impression that he heard it directly] and he narrated it by saying ‘an [meaning “from”, instead of saying “So and so told us” or “I heard So and so saying” etc] from Abu Waa’il and Ibraaheem.</p>\n<p>See: Tadhdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/241); ath-Thiqaat by Ibn Hibbaan (7/464).</p>\n<p>What appears to be the case is that it is acceptable here because reports narrated by Mugheerah from [‘an] Abu Wa’il and Ibraaheem were narrated in as-Saheehayn, in marfoo‘ reports, and the reports here is mawqoof, and undoubtedly leniency is more acceptable in mawqoof reports.</p>\n<p>With regard to the second isnaad, its men are also the men of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. With regard to Abu Mu‘aawiyah, although more than one of the scholars had some reservations about him, their reservations were only with regard to reports other than the reports he narrated from al-A‘mash. As for the reports he narrated from al-A‘mash in particular, he used to have a good memory of them, and he is one of the most trustworthy companions of al-A‘mash. Wakee‘ said: We have not met anyone who was more knowledgeable of the reports narrated by al-A‘mash than Abu Mu‘aawiyah.</p>\n<p>See: at-Tahdheeb (9/121).</p>\n<p>Mugheerah differed from al-A‘mash. Mugheerah narrated it from Abu Waa’il – with corroborating reports from Ibraaheem, who is an-Nakha‘i – from ‘Umar, and al-A‘mash narrated it from Abu Waa’il – whose name is Shaqeeq ibn Salamah – from ‘Amr ibn Shurahbeel from ‘Umar. The hadith of al-A‘mash is more sound.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, it is narrated soundly from ‘Umar, whether via Mugheerah or via al-A‘mash.</p>\n<p>With regard to the report of al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali, its isnaad includes Jahsh whose full name is Jahsh ibn Ziyaad ad-Dabbi. Ibn Abi Haatim mentioned him in al-Jarh wa’t-Ta‘deel (2/550), but he did not mention any details regarding him. Al-Bukhaari also mentioned him in at-Taareekh (2/253) and said: ath-Thawri, Abu Bakr and Muhammad ibn Fudayl ibn Ghazwaan narrated from him. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hibbaan mentioned him in ath-Thiqaat (6/157).</p>\n<p>Therefore not much is known about him. Some scholars regard as hasan the hadith of narrators such as this, especially mawqoof reports such as this.</p>\n<p>The ruling on rennet varies according to its source. If it is taken from an animal that was slaughtered in the prescribed manner, then it is pure (taahir) and may be eaten. If it is taken from an animal that died of natural causes or from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner, then there is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ regarding that. The majority of the Maalikis, Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is najis (impure). Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, according to another report from him, are of the view that it is taahir (pure). This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said in al-Fataawa (21:103):</p>\n<p>What is more likely to be the case is that their – that is, the Magians’ – cheese is halaal and that the rennet and milk of an animal that died of natural causes are taahir. That is because when the Sahaabah conquered Iraq, they ate the cheese of the Magians, and this was the prevalent practice among them. What is narrated from some of them, that they regarded that as makrooh, is subject to further examination.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>See questions no. <a href=\"/en/answers/2841\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">2841 </a>and <a href=\"/en/answers/115306\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">115306</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>    It is not     permissible for the father to see his son’s fiancée, because she is a     non-mahram to him. It is only permissible for his son to see her with     special permission from sharee‘ah, in order to create harmony and affection     after marriage. But no exception has been narrated with regard to the man’s     father; in that case the original prohibition on seeing her remains in     effect, and she is like any other woman who is a non-mahram to him. So he is     enjoined to avert his gaze from her, not to be alone with her and not to     shake hands with her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But when his son     does the marriage contract with his fiancée, she becomes his wife, even if     he has not consummated the marriage with her, and even if in your country     she is still called a fiancée after doing the marriage contract. This     customary naming of the matter does not affect anything, so long as the     son’s marriage contract has been done. In that case it becomes permissible     for the father to look at his son’s wife, because she has become a mahram to     him, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):    “Forbidden     to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters... the wives of your     sons who (spring) from your own loins”     [an-Nisa’ 4:23].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows     best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If after six days of menstruation a woman notices some light brown discharge of some sort, is that regarded as menstruation or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If this brownish discharge that the woman sees comes before she sees that she is pure (i.e., seeing a white discharge which indicates that the period is over), then it is part of the period. If it comes after she sees that she is pure, then it is not part of the period and does not affect her praying and fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) says in his essay al-Dima’ al-Tabee’iyyah li’l-Nisa’ (p. 19) concerning discharges that may interrupt the period:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The third kind is yellowish or brownish discharge, where a woman sees yellowish blood like blood from a wound, or brownish, somewhere between yellow and black. If this happens during the period or following on from it, before the woman becomes pure, then it is part of the period and comes under the rulings on menstruation. If it comes after she becomes pure, then it is not menstruation, because Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used not to regard the brownish or yellowish discharge that comes after a woman becomes pure as being anything that mattered.” Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said in Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam (p. 258):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that if a woman becomes pure and her period is over for certain – which means that she sees the white discharge that is known to women – then any brownish or yellowish discharge or spotting or wetness that comes after she has become pure is not menstruation, so it does not prevent her from praying or fasting, and it does not prevent a man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menstruation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But she should not rush until she has seen that she is pure, because some women, when the bleeding lessens, rush and do ghusl before seeing that the period is over (the white discharge mentioned above). Hence the women of the Sahaabah used to send the cotton with yellowish discharge to the mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and she would tell them: “Do not hasten until you see the white discharge.”.</p>\n",

      "title": "Taking help and asking for it from the state and from the church",
      "question": "<p>I live in America and we take some free services, especially since we are regarded as having limited income. But some of these services, such as food for example, can be taken from the churches. Is that permissible?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      There is nothing wrong with taking help from the state or       from organizations based on donations, even if they are churches, so long       as that does not lead to compromising on any issue of religion or       approving anything wrong or the children being influenced and so on. But       refraining from that and doing without it is preferable, because the upper       hand (the one that gives) is better than the lower (the one that takes),       especially with regard to taking from the church which usually has       ulterior motives in what it gives to the Muslims. Al-Bukhaari (1428)       narrated from Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allah be pleased with him) that the       Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The upper hand       (the one that gives) is better than the lower (the one that takes). Start       with those for whom you are responsible. The best of charity is that which       is given when you can afford it, and whoever refrains (from taking       charity), Allah will help him; whoever tries to do without charity, Allah       will make him independent of means. ”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (1429) and Muslim (1033) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar     (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say, when he was on the minbar,     speaking about charity and refraining from begging: “The upper hand is     better than the lower hand, and the upper hand is the one that gives and the     lower hand is the one that receives.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Asking for charity from people is something blameworthy, even     if one is asking from a Muslim, unless the one who asks is forced to do so,     because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Asking     for help causes a man to lose face, except when a man asks someone in a     position of authority or asks for something that he has no choice but to ask     for.”</p>\n<p>    Classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi and by al-Albaani in     Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was also narrated by Abu Dawood (1639) as follows:     “Begging (is like) wounds that a person scars his face with. So whoever     wishes to save face may do so, and whoever wishes not to save face may do     so, except if a person asks a person of authority, or is in a situation in     which he finds no alternative.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in Subul al-Salaam (1/548): Wounds means marks     or traces. As for his asking from a person in authority, there is no blame     in that, because he is only asking for what he is entitled to from the bayt     al-maal, and it is not a favour on the part of the person in authority,     because he is acting as a trustee, so it is like a person asking the trustee     to give him something to which he is entitled that he has with him. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (1475) and Muslim (1040) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah     ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will keep on begging from people     until he comes on the Day of Resurrection with not a bit of flesh on his     face.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Muslim (1041) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be     pleased with him) said: “Whoever begs from the people in order to accumulate     wealth, it is as if he is asking for a live coal, so let him ask for a     little or a lot.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What is meant by the words “Whoever begs from the people in     order to accumulate wealth” is that he asks of people in order to accumulate     a lot of wealth when he is not in need of it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In these hadeeths there is an eloquent rebuke, which is     clearly aimed at putting people off begging, except one who is forced to do     that and can find no other alternative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, so long as you are not in urgent need of help,     you should refrain from asking for it, but if you are in need of it, there     is nothing wrong with you asking for it and taking it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah to make you independent of means from His     bounty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

This applies only if something comes out; if     nothing comes out then the wudoo' remains valid and the person may offer the     following obligatory prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bahooti said in al-Rawdat al-Murbi’ (p. 57): The     woman who has istihaadah and people in similar situations such as those who     have urinary incontinence or continual madhiy or continual passing of wind     should do wudoo' when the time for each prayer begins if something has come     out, and they may pray both obligatory and supererogatory (naafil) prayers     so long as that time remains. So if nothing has come out then wudoo' is not     required. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The     woman who has istihaadah must do wudoo' for every prayer if something has     come out, but if nothing has come out then her first wudoo' remains valid.     End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (1/438).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you are not sure whether something came out from the time     you did wudoo' until the end of your tawaaf, then your tawaaf is valid and     you do not have to do anything. As for saa’i, it is not essential to be in a     state of purity for it, so if you did saa’i when you were not in a state of     purity, your saa’i is valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if you are certain that something came out after you did     wudoo', then you should have done wudoo' after the time for the new prayer     began in order for your tawaaf and prayer to be valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you did not do that, then your tawaaf is not valid     according to many of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But some of them are of the view that purity from minor     impurity is not essential for tawaaf, and if a person does tawaaf without     wudoo', his tawaaf is valid. This is the view of the Hanafis and was the     view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. It was also regarded as more     correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them). See the     answer to question number <a href=\"/en/answers/34695\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">34695</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this opinion, your tawaaf was valid and your Hajj     was valid, and you do not have to do anything, but you have to repeat the     prayer that you offered without having done wudoo'.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

And you (believers in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (peace and     blessings of Allah be upon him) were taught (through the Quran) that which     neither you nor your fathers knew.” Say: “Allah (sent it down).” Then leave     them to play in their vain discussions.”</p>\n<p>    [al-An‘am 6:91]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “They have not estimated Allah His Rightful Estimate. Verily,     Allah is All‑Strong, All‑Mighty.”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hajj 22:74]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to     Him.

He should always remember that     Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, the Angels, the Messengers and the     Prophets were never safe from slander and harm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

That is because returning a greeting is obligatory, but initiating this greeting is not a Sunnah that is enjoined, but neither is it forbidden.

      "question": "<p>What is the correct view concerning the Eid khutbah – should it be one khutbah or two? What is the evidence for that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The majority of scholars, of the four madhhabs and others, are of the view that two khutbahs should be given on Eid, and the imam should sit briefly between them, as is done in the Jumu’ah (Friday) khutbah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mudawwanah 1/231: Maalik said: In all khutbahs – the khutbah of the imam when praying for rain (istisqa’), the two Eids, the day of ‘Arafah and on Fridays – the imam should separate between the two khutbahs by sitting briefly. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Umm (1/272): It was narrated that ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah said: The Sunnah on Eid is for the imam to deliver two khutbahs, sitting briefly in between. Al-Shaafa’i said: that applies to the prayers for rain, the khutbah given during the eclipse prayer, the khutbah of Hajj, and every khutbah given to a congregation. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 1/276; al-Mughni, 2/121&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the report quoted above: The second hadeeth makes it more likely to be correct when we draw an analogy with Jumu’ah. ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah is a Taabi’i, as is well known, so his saying, “It is Sunnah” cannot be taken as evidence that it is the Sunnah of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as is stated in the usool. There is a marfoo’ hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah which speaks of sitting in between the two khutbahs of Eid, but its isnaad includes Isma’eel ibn Muslim, who is da’eef (weak). End quote from Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/323&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth of Ibn Maajah (1279) was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, who said: The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out on the day of Fitr or Adha and delivered a khutbah standing, then he sat for a while, then he stood up. This hadeeth was narrated by al-Albaani in Da’eef Ibn Maajah, where he said it is munkar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (4/4): al-Nawawi said in al-Khulaasah: the report narrated from Ibn Mas’ood, according to which he said, The Sunnah is for two khutbahs to be delivered on Eid, in between which the imam sits briefly, is da’eef and its isnaad is not uninterrupted. There is no proven report about giving more than one khutbah, and the evidence is analogy with Jumu’ah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may conclude from this the evidence which supports the idea of giving two khutbahs is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – The hadeeth of Ibn Maajah and the report of Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), both of which are da’eef, as stated above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – The report of ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah, who is a Taabi’i.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 –Analogy with Jumu’ah&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah be pleased with him) mentioned a fourth thing that may be quoted as evidence. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase ‘two khutbahs’ reflects the view of the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them), that there should be two khutbahs on Eid, because that was mentioned in a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah with his isnaad, which requires further examination. The apparent meaning is that two khutbahs should be given, but whoever examines the Sunnah in agreed-upon reports in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere will see that the Prophet&nbsp;(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only gave one khutbah, but after he had finished the first khutbah, he went to the women and exhorted them. If we take this as the basic principle concerning it being prescribed to give two khutbahs, then it is possible, although it is unlikely, because he went to the women and addressed them because they could not hear the khutbah. This is possible. And it may be possible that they could hear his words, but he wanted to address them specifically, hence he reminded them and exhorted them concerning matters that pertained specifically to them. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/191.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee was asked: Should the imam sit between the two khutbahs of Eid?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: The two khutbahs of Eid are Sunnah and come after the Eid prayer, because of the report narrated by al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Maajah and Abu Dawood, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I attended Eid prayer with the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When he had finished praying he said: “We will deliver a khutbah; whoever wishes to sit and listen to the khutbah, let him do so, and whoever wants to leave, let him do so.” Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Nayl: al-Musannif (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This shows that the khutbah is Sunnah; it is were obligatory, it would be obligatory to sit and listen to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is prescribed for the one who delivers two khutbahs on Eid to separate them by sitting briefly, by analogy with the two khutbahs of Jumu’ah, and because of the report narrated by al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) from ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: The Sunnah is for the Imam to deliver two khutbahs on Eid, sitting briefly in between them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars are of the view that there is only one khutbah for Eid prayer, because the saheeh ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) speak of only one khutbah. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/425&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Should the imam deliver one khutbah or two on Eid?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: The well known view among the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) is that there should be two khutbahs on Eid, because of a da’eef hadeeth which was narrated concerning that, but in the hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, it says that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only delivered one khutbah. I hope that the matter is flexible. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/246&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said (16/248):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sunnah is for there to be one khutbah, but if two khutbahs are given that is fine, because it was narrated that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also did that. But the imam should not forget to exhort the women in particular, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is speaking via a microphone and the women can hear him, he should devote the end of his khutbah to exhorting the women in particular. If he is not using a microphone and the women cannot hear him, then he should go to them, accompanied by one or two other men, and say a few words to them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion: This is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, and it is flexible. There is no definitive text in the Sunnah concerning this matter, although it seems that it should be one khutbah. Let the imam do whatever he thinks is closest to the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

I think that this is their right over us. Is there anything wrong with that? Because one of my colleagues asked me to find out, and if what I am doing is good, they will follow my example, and if what I am doing is an innovation (bid‘ah) I will stop doing it.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is permissible for women to go to the mosque to offer the funeral prayer, because there is no religious text which forbids doing that.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Offering the funeral prayer is prescribed for both men and women, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral until the prayer has been offered [for the deceased] will have one qiraat [of reward], and whoever attends until the deceased is buried will have two qiraats.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the two qiraats? He said: “Like two great mountains,” referring to reward. Its soundness is agreed upon. But women should not follow the funeral procession to the graveyard, for they are not allowed to do that, because of the report in <em>as-Saheehayn</em> from Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: We were forbidden to follow the bier but not emphatically.” With regard to offering the funeral prayer for the deceased, women were not forbidden to do that, whether the prayer is offered in the mosque or at home or in the prayer place. The women used to attend the funeral prayers in the mosque with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and after his time.</p>\n<p>As for visiting graves, that is only for men, as is also the case with following the bier to the graveyard, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves.\"(<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp;13/134).</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: With regard to this hadith that the questioner mentioned – “Women have no share of the funeral” – we do not know of any basis for it, and we do not know any of the scholars who narrated it. Rather what was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) regarding this matter is that he cursed the women who visit graves and those who build places of worship and install lamps over them, and he forbade women to follow the bier – i.e., to the graveyard. As for offering the funeral prayer with the people in the mosque or the prayer place, it is something that is prescribed for everyone. The women used to offer the obligatory prayer and funeral prayer with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) attended the funeral prayer for Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) in the mosque of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\"(<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp; 13/135-136).</p>\n<p>Based on that, there is nothing wrong with you going out to offer the funeral prayer in the mosque, when you are able to do so and that does not involve any other reprehensible actions such as panicking or wailing, or causing any fitnah.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What many imams do nowadays -- especially in the last ten days of Ramadan -- leading the people in Taraweeh prayer immediately after ‘Isha’, then going back to the mosque in the last part of the night to pray qiyaam, is something that is prescribed and it is not forbidden. There is no reason to suggest it is not allowed. What is required is to strive hard in the last ten days according to one's ability. If a person breaks up his night between prayer, resting, sleeping, and reading Qur'aan, then he has done well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah Abaabateen said, as is narrated in al-Durar al-Saniyyah (4/364):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In response to what some people do of objecting to the one who prays more during the last ten days of Ramadan than he usually did in the first twenty days, on the grounds that this is more than is usual and is ignorance of the Sunnah and the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and imams of Islam,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We say: There are hadeeths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which encourage praying Qiyaam al-layl during Ramadan, and particularly emphasise it during the last ten days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once it becomes clear that there is no specific number of rak’ahs for Taraweeh, and that the time for it according to all scholars is from after the Sunnah of ‘Isha’ until the break of dawn, and that spending the night in worship is a confirmed Sunnah, and that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) prayed taraweeh for many nights in congregation, then how can anyone object to the one who prays more during the last ten nights than he did at the beginning of the month? So during the last ten days, he prays at the beginning of the night, as he did at the beginning of the month, or a little, or a lot, without praying Witr, for the sake of those who are weak and want to limit themselves to that; then after that he does more prayers in congregation and calls all of it qiyaam or taraweeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the one who objects to that is confused by what many of the fuqaha’ say, that it is mustahabb for the imam not to pray more than one includes than one khatmah (reading of the entire Qur’aan), unless the people behind him prefer to do more than that. The reason they gave for not doing more than one khatmah is the hardship that may be caused for the people behind him, not because doing more than that is not prescribed in sharee’ah. So from their wording we may conclude that if people behind him want to do more than one khatmah, that is good, as was clearly stated in the words of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for what many of the common people say, calling what is done at the beginning of the night Taraweeh and the prayers offered after that qiyaam, this is what the uneducated people say. Rather all of it is qiyaam and taraweeh. The qiyaam of Ramadaan is called Taraweeh because they used to have a rest (yastareehoona) after every four rak’ahs because they used to make the prayers lengthy. The reason why some people object to that is that it is contrary to what is customary among the people of their countries and most of the people nowadays; and because of ignorance of the Sunnah and reports and of the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi’oon and the imams of Islam; and because of what some people think, that our prayer during the last ten days is a kind of salat al-ta’qeeb which was regarded as makrooh by some scholars, but that is not in fact the case, because ta’qeeb is a voluntary prayer offered in congregation after finishing Taraweeh and Witr.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is how all the fuqaha’ defined ta’qeeb, as a voluntary prayer offered in congregation after finishing Witr immediately after Taraweeh. From these words it is clear that prayer offered in congregation before Witr is not ta’qeeb. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said in Ithaaf Ahl al-Eemaan bi Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the last ten days of Ramadan, the Muslims increase their efforts in worship, following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking Laylat al-Qadr which is better than a thousand months. Those who pray twenty-three rak’ahs at the beginning of the month break it up during the last ten days, so they pray ten rak’ahs at the beginning of the night, calling it Taraweeh, and they pray ten at the end of the night, making them lengthy, and following it with three rak’ahs of Witr, which they call qiyaam. This is a variation in naming only. In fact all of it may be called Taraweeh or it may be called qiyaam. As for those who pray eleven or thirteen rak’ahs at the beginning of the month, they add ten rak’ahs to that during the last ten days, which they pray at the end of the night, making it lengthy, making the most of the virtue of the last ten days and increasing their efforts to do good. They have a precedent among the Sahaabah and others who prayed twenty-three rak’ahs, as stated above. Thus they combine the two opinions: the opinion which favours offering thirteen rak’ahs during the first twenty days and the opinion which favours offering twenty-three during the last ten days.

As for the daughters of his brother, and the sons and daughters of his sisters, they do not inherit anything, because they come under the heading of dhawi’l-arham (relatives who do not receive any share of the inheritance). According to the view that they may inherit, they only inherit when there are no heirs who are entitled to allocated shares and no male relatives on the father’s side, and this condition is not met in this case, because of the presence of the male relative on the father’s side, namely the son of the paternal uncle.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My father took out a loan with a bank guarantee certificate to pay off the balance owed by my brother for his apartment, but no one except me can pay off the monthly instalments on the loan. My father agreed with me that I should pay the instalment on the loan every month, in return for him giving me the amount mentioned in the certificate when the loan is paid off. I objected to the interest mentioned in the certificate, but he told me that I will take the original amount mentioned in the certificate, and I do not have anything to do with any extra amount or interest. Please note that the original amount mentioned in the certificate will be mine. Is there any sin on me at present, because I am paying off the loan?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Taking out loans with interest from the bank is haram, because it comes under the heading of riba (usury), for which Allah has warned those who deal with it of war, and He has warned them of punishment for it, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.</p>\n<p>And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger.

Repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from getting involved in haram certificates.</p>\n<p>2. Get rid of the certificates, by taking the capital and giving the interest (riba) to charitable causes that serve the interests of the Muslims.</p>\n<p>What your father must do is repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from taking out a riba-based loan.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with you paying off your father’s loan, because the principal of this riba-based loan has to be paid off.

If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise inherit his abode.

What this hadeeth means is that which is mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: everyone has an abode in Paradise and an abode in Hell. If the believer enters Paradise, the disbeliever in Hell will take his place, because he deserves that due to his disbelief. What is meant by the words “your ransom from the Fire” is that you were exposed to the risk of entering the Fire, and this is your ransom, because Allah, may He be exalted, decreed a number for it to fill it. Because the disbelievers will enter it because of their disbelief and sin, they will become like ransoms for the Muslims.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (17/85)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because every accountable person has a place in Paradise and a place in Hell, whoever believes truly, his place in Hell will be replaced with a place in Paradise, but for the one who does not believe it will be the opposite, and it will be as if the disbelievers took the places of the believers in Hell. Moreover, because Allah has sworn to fill Hell, it will be filled with the disbelievers so as to save the believers from the Fire. So in that regard they are like a ransom for the believers. Perhaps the reason why the Jews and Christians are singled out for mention is because they are well known for their opposition to the Muslims and for being their opposites with regard to believing in the Messenger, which dictates that they should be saved.</p>\n<p>End quote from Mirqaat al-Mafaateeh (8/3525).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up all of that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the Day of Resurrection there will be a Jew or a Christian for every Muslim, who will be his ransom from the Fire. That does not contradict the fact that some Muslims sinners will enter the Fire for their sins, so that Allah may purify them thereof, because they will enter it, then they will be brought out of it by Allah’s mercy, then they will enter Paradise, where they will inherit what would have been the disbelievers’ places in it, because Allah has forbidden it to the disbelievers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Allah (st) will give every Muslim a Jew or a Christian, and He will say: This is your ransom from the Fire.” Indicate that this bounty will include all the Muslims, with no exceptions, because ransom is salvation, as mentioned above, and salvation will be for every Muslim. That is not contradicted by the fact that he may enter the Fire, because his entering it will be for the purpose of purification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No evil doer or anyone who has a trace of evildoing will enter Paradise.

Whoever is not purified in this world, if his impurity is inherent, as in the case of the disbeliever, he will not enter paradise under any circumstances, but if his impurity is acquired because of sin and is transient, he will enter Paradise after having been purified in the Fire from that impurity, then he will be brought out of the Fire.</p>\n<p>Endquote from Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/56)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, it will benefit him someday in his life, no matter what befalls him before that.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu ‘jam al-Awsat (6396); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Targheeb (1525)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147996\">147996</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/138650\"> 138650</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The problem is that I do not know how many prayers I offered without being purified, but I do not think they are too many because I always did ghusl after my menses. I am afraid that there may also be a number of days of Ramadaan when I fasted without being pure. I think that it happened three times but it may have been more. I made up the prayers of two weeks. Please advise me as to what I should do, because I am always thinking about this matter and how many times the shaytaan has whispered to me that I should become Muslim anew so that my past sins will be forgiven, but praise be to Allaah, I seek refuge with Him from the shaytaan and I do not do this awful thing.</p>\n",

Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-‘Abdi     said: I saw Abu Zayd, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him), whose legs had been injured (in jihad) for the     sake of Allah, giving the adhaan whilst sitting.

So one     should start to pray immediately after reciting the iqaamah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad said in his Masaa’il     (61/220): I said to my father: Can a man walk whilst saying the iqaamah?

They gave them what had been agreed upon, then the           Sahaabah said to one another, “Let us not do anything until we tell           the Prophet  (peace and blessings           of Allaah be upon him).” When they came to Madeenah, they told him about           it and he said, “You did the right thing.” There is nothing wrong with           reciting into water or oil to treat the sick, the one who is affected           by sihr (witchcraft) or           the insane, but reciting over the sick person and blowing onto him is           better and is preferable. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him)           narrated with a hasan isnaad           that the Prophet  (peace and blessings           of Allaah be upon him) recited into water for Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas,           then he poured it over him. The Prophet            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There is nothing           wrong with ruqyah so long           as it does not involve shirk.”           This saheeh hadeeth includes the sick person doing ruqyah           for himself, and doing ruqyah           by reciting into water, oil, etc. And Allaah is the Source of strength.&nbsp; </p>\n",

      "title": "A righteous young man is overwhelmed with worry and anxiety. What is the remedy?",
      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>There is a young man who is suffering from psychological distress, depression and worry, and he does not know what is the cause. Please note that he prays qiyaam al-layl and fasts a great deal, and he prays (the five daily prayers), but sometimes he sleeps and misses a prayer. He attends Islamic classes and reads books, and he is trying to memorize the Quran, and he listens to Islamic tapes. Despite that he is suffering from depression and worry. Please also note that this young man loves his paternal aunt a great deal and was always helping her, and the aunt is in good health.</div>\n<div>I hope that you will answer me as soon as possible so that this young man can be helped. Thank you very much.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We are happy to see your concern for this young man and your eagerness to find an effective remedy to offer him in the hope that Allah will benefit him thereby. By doing that you are strengthening the ties of Islamic brotherhood. We hope that Allah will reward you for that.</p>\n<p>You have explained this young man’s situation, and we will reply in the following points:</p>\n<p>1 – In this dunya (this world – the name in Arabic carries connotations both of that which is close and that which is base and vile), a man’s life is not consistent, rather his circumstances will vary between that which he likes and that which he does not like.&nbsp; The wise man, when he thinks about this world, will realize that he needs to develop an optimistic outlook and put an end to worries and distress that could disturb him and cause him stress.</p>\n<p>What the Shaytaan wants to do is to cause the Muslim grief and stress. Being introverted and thinking constantly about pain and sorrow gives the Shaytaan a great opportunity and may cause the worries and stress to multiply. Looking forward to a happy life and being optimistic is one of the means of feeling content and at peace. It is known that this world is a mixture of ease and hardship, joy and sorrow, hope and pain, so why should a person help the dark side to prevail over the bright side?</p>\n<p>Wisdom dictates that if a man cannot make optimism prevail, then at the very least he should think in a balanced and objective manner.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Feelings of stress and that life is too hard do not control a man's mind unless there are reasons that provoke these kinds of feelings. Rather they are indicative that the relationship between a person and his Lord is not sound. The more a man turns to Allah and focuses on Him, the more he will feel a sense of peace and comfort, to an extent that no one knows except Allah. Hence those who know Allah, are close to Him and fear Him are the happiest of people, to such an extent that one of them said, in a well known expression: “If the kings and the sons of kings knew what joy we have, they would fight us for it with the sword.” This is also what is expressed in the Quran, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”&nbsp;[al-Nahl 16:97]</p>\n<p>But feeling stressed is a kind of wake-up call that alerts a person to check on his relationship with his Lord, because sins may have the effect of making a person feel scattered and unfocused. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection”&nbsp;[Ta-Ha 20:124]</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of goodness in the young man whom you are asking about, for he is a person who is keen to seek knowledge, and he does naafil acts of worship such as fasting, and he upholds ties of kinship with his aunt. However you must draw his attention to the fact that he has to check on his relationship with Allah, for there may be some sin that is preventing him from achieving this sense of happiness, some sin that he has committed with regard to the rights of Allah or the rights of others. So encourage him to repent and seek forgiveness a great deal, especially since you said that he sometimes sleeps and misses the prayer – this is a serious matter although many people take it lightly.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>It may be that this test of this person through disasters and calamities is something that has been decreed by Allah for him in order to raise him in status, if he persists in obeying what Allah has commanded, which is to be patient and accept whatever Allah decrees. Everything that Allah decrees for a believer is good for him and his affairs, both spiritual and worldly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one except a believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is also good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)</p>\n<p>If something bad happens to a believer, he either bears it with patience or panics. If he is patient he earns a great reward and accepts the will and decree of Allah, because he knows that it comes from Allah, so he feels content with it and accepts it. So what reason is there to panic and feel stressed?</p>\n<p>On the contrary, if he is not patient and he reacts to what befalls him of sin with panic and anger, and worry and stress, he will lose the reward that Allah has promised to those who are patient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning”&nbsp;[al-Zumar 39:10]</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>He should sincerely turn towards Allah and call upon Him (du’a’), beseeching Him to relieve him of this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) and seeking refuge in Him a great deal from the accursed Shaytaan. For it annoys the Shaytaan to see a believing slave feeling peace of mind and contentment, so he whispers to him to distract him from that and make him fearful and confused.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us a du’aa’ by which we may ward off worries and distress. Ahmad (3528) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatika naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qurana rabee’ qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa’ huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, should we learn this?” He said: “Of course; everyone who hears it should learn it.”</p>\n<p>(Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199)</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>Try to suggest that he change something in his daily routine, to allow himself the opportunity to do different kinds of permissible things that will relieve him of boredom and renew his energy. There is nothing wrong with travelling for leisure purposes or to relax, so long he does not go to extremes. Even better than that is if he can travel for the purpose of ‘Umrah and to visit the Prophet’s mosque, because a change of scene can be very beneficial.</p>\n<p>Sixthly:</p>\n<p>He has to keep away from places that he feels make his worry and distress worse, or that stir these feeling up again. He should avoid reading novels that tell sad stories, and he should try not to sit with people who are worried and distressed, even if his intention is to console them.&nbsp; On the contrary, he should try to read useful books that will take him away from these worries. If he feels stressed and upset, he should not isolate himself or think constantly about his problems in this situation.</p>\n<p>Finally:</p>\n<p>Our advice to this young man is that he should raise his head and look forward, and view the future with optimism and the certainty that he will succeed. I say to him: You have a great deal of potential for success and high achievement, and a lot is to be expected of someone like you. We hope that these troubles and worries will be lifted from you. May Allah make things easy for you and relieve you of your distress and worry.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is zakaah due on rent that has just been received or rent paid when one year has passed?",
      "question": "<p>We have a store which we rented out for 72,000 lira per year. Do we have to pay zakaah? Please note that we receive the rent in one payment, and we spend it before the year has passed.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    No zakaah is due on properties that are prepared for rental;     rather zakaah is due on the rent that is paid on them, subject to two     conditions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-That it reaches the minimum     threshold at which zakaah becomes due (nisaab)</p>\n<p>    2-That one full hijri year has     passed (since acquiring it).</p>\n<p>    The year starts from when you sign the contract, whether the     rent is paid in advance at the beginning of the year or at the end of the     year. If it was received at the beginning of the year and the year has     passed, then zakaah must be paid on it, or on what is left of it if some has     been spent and some is left.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If it is received at the end of the year then zakaah must be     paid on it, because one year has passed since the contract was signed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Mughni (4/271):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person rents out     his house for two years for forty dinars, the rent is considered to have     come into his possession at the time of the contract, and he has to pay     zakaah on the whole amount when one year has passed. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about a man who rented out some     property and received payment for one year in advance, and he used it to pay     off some debts – does he have to pay zakaah on this rent?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: No zakaah is due on rent in such a case, where it     was received from the renter in advance and he used it to pay off a debt,     because a full year did not pass since it came into his possession. What     counts here is the date of the rental contact until the end of the year. If     he received the rent before the end of the year and used it to pay off a     debt or he spent it on things needed for the house, then no zakaah is due on     it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz,     14/177&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen     was asked about properties that are prepared for rent – is zakaah due on     them?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    No zakaah is due on these properties, because the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not     have to pay zakaah on his slave or his horse.” Rather zakaah is due on the     rent, if one full year has passed since the contract was drawn up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example: a man rents     out his house for ten thousand, and he receives ten thousand after one year     has passed; he has to pay zakaah on this ten thousand, because one year has     passed since the contract was drawn up. Another man rented out his house for     ten thousand – five thousand of which he received at the time of signing the     contract, and which spent within two months, and five thousand to be paid     halfway through the year, which he took and spent within two months. When     the year is over, he has nothing left of the rent, so no zakaah is due on     it, because it did not spend one full year in his possession, and zakaah is     only due if it has spent one year in his possession. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,     18/208&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows     best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I heard some people say that it is permissible to sell and to sew women’s dresses that do not cover the woman properly – i.e., short dresses – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave to Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) a red silk garment, and when ‘Umar wore it and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him, he said, “I gave it to you so that you could give it as a gift, not so that you could wear it.” So ‘Umar gave it to someone who had been one of his friends during the Jaahiliyyah. <br />\nIs this view correct? <br />\nIf it is correct, then can we draw the analogy from this that it is permissible to sell cigarettes, tobacco, women’s pants and revealing swimsuits for men and women, even though Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br />\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”<br />\n[al-Maa’idah 5:2] ? <br />\nI hope you can explain. May Allaah bless you and keep you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2104) and Muslim (2068) and others, in several places and via several isnaads. For example, al-Bukhaari narrated it under the heading Baab al-Tijaarah fima yukrah libsuhu li’l-rijaali wa’l-nisa’ (Chapter on dealing in things that are makrooh for men and women), via Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar from his father, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a hullah (garment) of silk and he saw him wearing it and said, “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for the one who wears it is one who has no share (in the Hereafter). Rather I sent it to you so that you could make use of it,” i.e., sell it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to deal in clothes that may be used in one way but not in another, and it is permissible to give them to others, and the one who buys such a thing or to whom it is given has to use it in ways that are permissible, not in ways that are forbidden. Examples of that include gold jewellery, weapons, knives, grapes and other things that may be used for halaal or haraam purposes. It is permissible to deal in them and to give them to others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The one who buys or is given such things must use them in ways that are permissible, such as selling them, giving them as gifts, etc; he should not use them in any way that is forbidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the thing is something that is forbidden to use in any way, then it is not permissible to deal in it or to give it as a gift, such as pigs, lions and wolves. There is nothing in the hadeeth to suggest that it is permissible to sell the things mentioned in the question, so it is not valid to draw an analogy between selling cigarettes, tobacco and revealing swimsuits for men and woman and selling things that may be used in one way but not another, or under some circumstances but not others, because it is haraam to use them in all circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "An airline steward is asking: is it permissible for me to offer alcohol to passengers?",
      "question": "<p>Dear Shaykh, I would like to know which of these two things is better: for a man to work as an airline steward, and on some trips some kinds of alcohol are offered. Is it better to conceal the alcohol so that the passengers do not see it, and therefore do not ask for it except in rare cases, or to show the alcohol as usual, because it is the passengers’ right?… Is there a difference between the two matters in terms of sin for the one who serves alcohol once a month, and the one who serves it ten times?… Please note that both men are not pleased with this blameworthy act that is imposed on them by the company.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\t\tWhat the Muslim must do is fear Allah with regard to his \t\twork, and seek out earnings that are lawful and wholesome. Allah has \t\tmade every person accountable for his actions and He will ask him about \t\this earnings: from where did he acquire them and on what did he spend \t\tthem? Anything that comes under the heading of disobedience to Allah or \t\tdisobedience to the Messenger must be avoided, and the Muslim must avoid \t\thelping others with it, and he should strive to put a stop to it, \t\tbecause Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, \trighteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \ttransgression”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Maa’idah 5:2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tUndoubtedly alcohol is the mother of all evils. The Prophet \t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed ten people with regard to \talcohol: The one who presses (the grapes, etc), the one for whom they are \tpressed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it \tis carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, the one who consumes \tits price, the one who purchases it, and the one for whom it is purchased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (1295); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt is not permissible for the airline steward to serve \talcohol to the passengers, because that comes under the heading of approving \tof evil and helping others with it. What he must do is pour it away or \tdestroy it, if he is able to do so; at the very least he should prevent \tthose who want to consume it, and tell them not to do that. Otherwise it is \tnot permissible for him to do this job in which he is not able to denounce \tevil and, rather, he is encouraged to help others to do it. He has to give \tup this job and look for a lawful means of earning a living and permissible \twork.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tWhat is the ruling on an airline steward who is obliged to \tcarry alcohol on board the plane, and what should he do?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThey replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tDrinking alcohol is prohibited, and selling it and \tmanufacturing it is prohibited, and serving it to one who will drink it is \tprohibited, because the one who serves it is helping the one who drinks it \tto commit sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, \tsays(interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, \trighteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \ttransgression”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Maa’idah 5:2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tBased on that, it is not permissible to remain in the job \tmentioned. The ways of earning a living are many, and Allah, may He be \tglorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will \tmake a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</p>\n<p>\t3.&nbsp;And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \timagine”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Talaaq 65:2-3].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (22/ 96)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt is not permissible for the airline steward to serve \talcohol to the passengers, whether in small or great amounts, and whether he \tserves it once or more than that. All of that is prohibited, although \tprohibited things vary in degree, and the one who commits a sin several \ttimes incurs a greater burden of sin than one who does it just once, and so \ton.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe questioner’s saying that alcohol is the right of the \tpassenger is completely incorrect. How can it be his right when Allah has \tcursed the one who drinks it?! Whatever rights people claim that are \tcontrary to the commands and rulings of Allah, those rights are invalid, \tbecause they are not rights at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe fact that both stewards do not approve does not make it \tpermissible for them to cooperate in doing evil deeds and exposing \tthemselves to the wrath and curse of Allah – Allah forbid; rather not \tapproving means that one should not participate in the sin, or sit in the \tplace where it is being committed, as Allah, may He be exalted, says \t(interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“And it has \talready been revealed to you in the Book (this Quran) that when you hear the \tVerses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until \tthey engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) \tcertainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will collect \tthe hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”</p>\n<p>\t[an-Nisa’ 4:140].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tShaykh as-Sa ‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAllah has explained to you – in what He has revealed to you – \tthat His shar‘i rulings to be followed when attending gatherings in which \tdisbelief and sin are present:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this \tQuran) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at” \tthat is, being belittled. That is because what is required of every \taccountable person with regard to the Revelations of Allah is to believe in \tthem, then venerate them and respect them. That is the purpose for which \tthey were revealed, and it is the purpose for which Allah created His \tcreation. The opposite of belief is rejection of them, and the opposite of \trespecting them is mocking them and scorning them. That includes the \targuments that the disbelievers and hypocrites may come up with to \tinvalidate the Revelations of Allah and support their disbelief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe same also applies to innovators of various types. Their \targument in support of their falsehood implies disrespect towards the \tRevelations of Allah, because the revelation only supports the truth, and \tdoes not contain anything but truth. And in fact this also applies to \tattending gatherings of sin and immorality, in which the commands and \tprohibitions of Allah are flouted and the limits that He has set for His \tslaves are transgressed. This ruling also includes the prohibition on \tsitting with them, “until they engage in a talk other than that” that \tis, until they begin to talk about things other than disbelief in the \tRevelations of Allah and ridiculing them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t“(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case” \tthat is, if you sit with them in the situation mentioned,</p>\n<p>\t“you would be like them” because then you would be \tapproving of their disbelief and ridicule, and the one who approves of sin \tis like the one who does it. The point is that whoever attends a gathering \tin which Allah is disobeyed is obliged to object to them if he is able to, \tor to get up and leave if he is not able to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di (210)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tConclusion:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt is not permissible for you to carry alcohol, or to give it \tto any of the passengers, and even if the company orders you to do that, \tthere is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience \ttowards the Creator. In fact the minimum that you must do is hide it, and do \tnot let the passengers see it. If one of them looks for it, do not tell him \twhere it is, and if it so happens that one of them asks for it, and insists \ton what the company has allowed him, you should not be the one who gives it \tto him, or play any part in that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tPlease see also the answers to questions no.\t<a href=\"/en/answers/1830\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">1830</a> and <a href=\"/en/answers/96739\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">96739</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows best.</p>\n",

I have produced a device that does this, and it works on the basis of a very small detector (with a thickness of 1-2mm) that is placed under the prayer mat or directly beneath the forehead of the worshipper, and it counts the number of prostrations, on the basis of which it works out the number of rak‘ahs that the worshipper has done, then it shows them on a small digital screen in front of the worshipper.

      "answer": "<p>\t\tFirstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tCounting the number of rak‘ahs in the prayer is something for \twhich there is a precedent in the practice and words of the early \tgenerations. Their methods of counting varied according to their \tenvironments and times. Some of them used to use their rings, some used date \tstones or pebbles, and others used their fingers or toes. All of this \tconfirms that there is a basis for using such a device to count the number \tof prostrations and rak‘ahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIbn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\t</p>\n<p>\tAl-Fadl ibn Shaadhaan quoted in his book ‘Add al-Aayi \twa’r-Rak ‘aat fi’s-Salaah the hadith of ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim \tfrom his father, from ‘Aa’ishah, according to which, when she offered an \tobligatory prayer, she would count her prayer with her ring, moving it on \ther hand until she finished her prayer, and counting with it.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from al-Khawaatim by Ibn Rajab (p. 109). The \tisnaad going back to ‘Aa’ishah is saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAl-Kharashi al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tMoving the ring from one finger to another in order to count \tthe rak‘ahs when one is afraid of forgetting does not come under the heading \tof fidgeting, because that is being done in the interests of the prayer.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (1/294)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIn Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen (1/650) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt says in al-Bahr: With regard to moving the tips of \tthe fingers (to keep count) or counting in one’s mind, that is not makrooh, \taccording to consensus, but counting out loud spoils the prayer, according \tto consensus. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tMuhammad al-Baabirti al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) \tsaid:</p>\n<p>\t… It was narrated from Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad that there is \tnothing wrong with counting on the hand. He mentioned the hand specifically, \tbecause moving the tips of the fingers (to keep count) or counting in one’s \tmind is not makrooh, according to consensus, but he warned against counting \tout loud, because it spoils the prayer.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from al-‘Inaayah Sharh al-Hidaayah (1/418)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tShaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tHe may count the number of rak‘ahs, and there may be a need \tto do so, because many people may forget and resort to counting them on \ttheir fingers, in which case there is a problem, because when the worshipper \tbows, he has to spread his fingers, and when he prostrates, his fingers must \tbe straight. Therefore he may count them using pebbles or date stones. So he \tcan put four dates stones in his pocket, then when he has prayed the first \trak‘ah, he can move one of them, and so on until they are finished. There is \tnothing wrong with this, because there is a need for it, especially when one \tis very forgetful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni‘ \t(3/249, 250).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tSecondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tBut in the case of this counter and similar inventions, there \tare a number of concerns:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t1.\tThe worshipper may be distracted by looking at it and \tthinking about its numbers. In most cases he will not be content with the \tnumber of the sajdah or rak‘ah until he thinks it over so that he may be \tsure that it is correct. This is something that may cause the device to miss \tits original purpose, which is to help one to focus in prayer and not be \tdistracted by anything outside the prayer.</p>\n<p>\t2.\tThere are essential parts and obligatory acts in the \tprayer that the device does not take into account. There may be a mistake in \tthe recitation of al-Faatihah, or the worshipper may forget to sit for the \tfirst tashahhud, or he may not bow at all, but the device may count it as a \trak‘ah because he prostrated twice! In which case the benefit from it may be \tlimited or completely absent. Similar problems may arise if there is a \tprostration of recitation (sujood at-tilaawah) during the prayer.</p>\n<p>\tThirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tWith regard to our opinion concerning this device and similar \tdevices, we say:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIslam came to enjoin presence of mind when praying, and it \thas prescribed clear rulings for the one who loses focus and makes mistakes \tin his prayer. If he loses focus and does not know how many rak‘ahs he has \tprayed, then he should proceed on the basis of the lower number, then do the \tprostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam. It is also prescribed \tfor him to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytaan and to spit drily to his \tleft when he realises that he has become distracted in his prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tWhat we think is that it is permissible and useful for one \twho is faced with compulsive whispers, or is very forgetful and that is \tcausing him some difficulties, if it will benefit him in his prayer and will \tfulfil its purpose by helping him to focus on his prayer. But in ordinary \tcases, when there is no particular need for such things, we do not think \tthat a person should use it; rather there is the fear that it may come under \tthe heading of blameworthy unnecessary effort and things that people have \tintroduced into the matter of worship that are detrimental to the original \tpurpose of focusing the heart on Allah, and praying with proper humility, so \tyou see him giving free rein to the thoughts and whispers that come to him, \trelying on the device to count his prayer for him!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows best.    </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A husband of a good religious sister spends most of his time watching or playing football. She does not have a television at her home, Alhamdulillah. So her husband spends most of his time outside home to watch football. She does not have children. <br />\n<br />\nMy question:<br />\n<br />\nShall she just buy a television so that her husband stays with her at home? As she spends the whole day alone while her husband is away.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Playing football (soccer)     may be permissible or it may be haram, depending on whether the player     adheres to shar’i guidelines or goes against them. This has been explained     in the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/3633\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">3633</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/84291\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">84291</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/75644\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">75644</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A wise person should not     keep busy with playing it or watching it, even if it is permissible, because     time is a man’s capital, and undoubtedly the husband’s being busy with that     and staying out of the house because of it, is a shortcoming and negligence,     because time is too precious to waste, so how can he waste it on something     that brings no benefit? It would be better for him to take care of his     family and try to make them happy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for bringing a TV into     the home, we do not advise that, because of its obvious bad effects.

      "question": "<p><span>I want to know the rulings concerning self-medication in Islam</span>.</p>\n<p> <span>I have been going through a rough time in my marriage. My husband neglects me (i do not know intentionally or unintentionally). He spends all his day on his computer or phone playing games, talking to friends, continuously. We dont have one conversation where his phone doesnt interrupt us. And he hardly spends two hours uninterrupted with me throughout the day</span>.</p>\n<p> <span>We have had many fights about this in the past 2 years but I decided to do sabr and stay silent. However, I feel depressed, rejected, restless, and lonely and I cant sleep. So i turned to muscle relaxants. The kind I use are available without a prescription but I feel that I am dependent on them now. I have alot of hopelessness and anxiety but as soon as I take a relaxant I sleep and wake up feeling calm</span>.</p>\n<p> <span>I wasn't prescribed this by a doctor. I have a history of not being able to sleep properly and I use such medications on and off. Their affect starts 30 to 40 minutes after taking the pill and lasts for 4 to 6 hours - but even after this the pills keep me mentally and physically calm. I know intoxicants are haram in Islam. Will using such pills through self medication also stop my prayer from being accepted for 40 days? Can you tell me about any and all rulings concerning this</span>?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The wife has rights over her husband, namely kind treatment, maintenance, accommodation, and his being able to meet her physical needs in order to maintain her chastity and meet her emotional needs. All these rights are proven in the Quran and Sunnah.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the husband has rights over his wife, namely kind treatment, obedience in that which is right and proper, allowing him to be intimate with her, looking after him, and not going out of the house except with his permission. These rights and duties have been explained previously in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10680\" target=\"_blank\">10680</a> .</p>\n<p>With regard to what you have mentioned about your husband being distracted from you, the remedy for that is communication and looking for activities that you can do together, such as seeking knowledge, memorizing Quran, going on outings during your spare time, reducing use of the phone, and so on.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to use sleeping pills and relaxants except on the advice of a trustworthy doctor, because some of them can contain narcotics, some of them can cause addiction, and some of them do more harm than good.</p>\n<p>So treating yourself with this kind of medicine is prohibited, for the reasons we have mentioned.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on taking sleeping pills or what are called relaxants? Do they come under the heading of narcotics or not? Is that permissible in the case of necessity or if it is advised by a doctor?</p>\n<p>He replied: It is not permissible to use these pills except in the case of necessity, on condition that they be recommended by a knowledgeable doctor, because they are dangerous and have an impact on the function of the brain. If someone uses them, they may bring about relaxation for a short time, but that will be followed by a greater evil. So it is important to note that it is permissible to use them when there is a need for that, on condition that that be done under the supervision of a doctor and on his advice.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb</em> (tape no. 82, side A).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle regarding any medicine that contains any kind of narcotic is that it is probihited, but if they must be used for treatment and there is no permissible alternative, then in that case it is permissible to use them, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>1.. That the patient’s need for that medicine has reached the level of necessity or urgent need.</p>\n<p>2.. That a trustworthy Muslim doctor testifies that this narcotic medicine is indeed beneficial for the patient.</p>\n<p>3.. That use of the medicine is limited to the extent to which it will meet the necessity.</p>\n<p>4.. That this medicine will not cause the patient any harm greater than or equal to the harm for which it is being used.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/192321\" target=\"_blank\">192321</a> .</p>\n<p>Our advice to you is to seek the advice of a female doctor who is specialized in the medicine that you are using; to reduce your use of medicines in general; and to seek help to treat your anxiety and insomnia by means of beneficial kinds of treatment that are prescribed in Islamic teachings, such as reading Quran, remembering Allah and sending blessings upon His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him),&nbsp; for that will bring reassurance to the heart and dispel worries.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah . Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured” [ar-Ra‘d 13:28]</em>.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When two thirds of the night had passed, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and said: “O people, remember Allah, O people, remember Allah, for the first Trumpet blast at which the earth will tremble has come, and it will be followed by the second Trumpet blast. Death has come, with all that it entails, death has come with all that it entails.” Ubayy said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I send a great deal of blessings upon you; how much of my du`a should be sending blessings upon you? He said: “Whatever you wish.” I said: One quarter? He said: “Whatever you wish, and if you do more, that will be better for you.” I said: One half? He said: “Whatever you wish and if you do more, that will be better for you.” I said: Two thirds? He said: “Whatever you wish and if you do more, that will be better for you.” I said: I will make all of my du`a sending blessing upon you. He said: “Then your concerns will be taken care of and your sins will be forgiven.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2457); classed as hasan by al-Albani in <em>Saheeh at-Tirmidhi</em>.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi</em>: “how much of my du`a should be sending blessings upon you?” means: instead of my du`a that I offer for myself? This was stated by al-Qaari.</p>\n<p>Sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the greatest means of attaining reassurance and peace of mind, and relief from worries and distress.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to rectify your husband’s condition and to take away your distress and sorrow.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Sayyiduna al-Lajlaj (radiyallahu’anhu) then mentioned that he heard this from Rasulullah (sallallahu’alaihi wasallam).

      "question": "<p>How can four witnesses be brought against the man and woman who commit zina in the present age? <br />\n<br />\nHow can we advise our Muslim youth against this evil action? May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars have listed the ways of establishing proof of     zina, and there are four ways:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-Testimony of witnesses</p>\n<p>    2-Admission by the parties     concerned</p>\n<p>    3-Pregnancy of a woman who has no     husband or master</p>\n<p>    4-If the husband engages in     li’aan and the wife refuses to take part in li’aan</p>\n<p>    With regard to witnesses to zina, they should be four people     whose testimony is acceptable, and they should state that they have seen the     zina in clear terms, i.e., they should have seen the man’s penis in the     woman’s vagina.&nbsp; If some of them only testify that they saw them naked, or     they describe certain positions or movements, that is not sufficient to     proof that zina took place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in    al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/157):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They should describe zina in clear terms, such as saying: “I     saw his penis in her vagina”. There is no alternative to that. If they say:     “We saw him on top of her and they were naked”, that is not acceptable. Even     if they say “We saw him doing with her what a man does with his wife,” that     is not sufficient as testimony. They must say “We bear witness that his     penis was in her vagina.” And this is very difficult, as the man said who     was testified against at the time of ‘Umar: “If you were among the (four)     thighs you would never be able to give this testimony.” Hence Shaykh     al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah mentioned that at his time no case of zina was proven     by means of testimony from the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) until the time of Ibn Taymiyah. If no case was proven     from that time until the other, then we do not know of any case that was     proven by testimony up till our own times, because it is very difficult. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This strictness with regard to testimony about zina serves     only to achieve the purpose aimed at by sharee’ah, which is to conceal     people and not spread immorality, and to make societies avoid accusations     against people’s honour and aspersions on their lineages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (5/83):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has stated that testimony in a case of zina must be     given by four people, so as to make it hard for those who are testifying to     such a thing, and to conceal people. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer     (1/563): “Why did they not produce four witnesses?” [al-Noor 24:13],     i.e., why did the accusers not bring witnesses to the things they accused     them of? “four witnesses” i.e., of good character. “Since they     (the slanderers) have not produced witnesses! Then with Allaah they are the     liars” – even if they are certain about that in themselves, they are     liars in Allaah’s judgement, because Allaah has forbidden them to speak of     that without four witnesses. Hence Allaah says: “Then with Allaah they     are the liars”, and He did not say “Then they are the liars”. All of     this points to the grave sanctity of the Muslim’s honour, so it is not     permissible to make accusations against it without establishing testimony.

It is a communal responsibility,     not an individual one. It is not possible to attain the well being of     societies without integrated efforts to adopt the means that will protect     them against zina and its effects. These means include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – Spreading awareness of the seriousness of the sin of     zina, and that it is one of the major sins which common sense and sharee’ah     agree is abhorrent and haraam; explaining that it is the cause of nations’     downfall and that it brings calamities upon this world, and the punishment     of Hell on the Day of Resurrection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Ahmad said: After murder, there is nothing worse than     zina. Ghadha’ al-Albaab (2/435).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a     Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an     evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah forgives him)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:32]</p>\n<p>    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer     (1/457):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah describes zina and its evil as “a Faahishah (i.e.     anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin” i.e., a sin that is     abhorrent according to sharee’ah, common sense and sound human nature,     because it is a transgression against the rights of Allaah, the rights of     the woman, the rights of her family, and the rights of her husband, and it     is spreading immorality, confusing lineages and other evils. The phrase “and     an evil way” means it is an evil way for the one who dares to commit     this grave sin. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Making the youth aware of the bad effects that result from     the spread of this evil, which threatens the stability of families and     societies, such as the spread of fatal diseases, the prevalence of     illegitimate children, disintegration of the family, children not being     cared for properly and having a bad upbringing, increase in the divorce     rate, spread of crime and so on. These effects are felt by the societies in     which permissiveness in its worst forms is widespread, which could lead to     disintegration of those societies and the downfall of those civilizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – Striving to facilitate the shar’i way to have sexual     relationships, which is through halaal marriage, by encouraging marriage and     explaining that sharee’ah encourages it, and that it is the way of the     Messengers, and that the one who gets married has completed half of     religion, and that he will be rewarded for keeping himself and his wife     chaste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    4 – One of society’s responsibilities in this matter is to     remove the obstacles that cause delays in getting married. So they should     address the poverty that may be an obstacle to marriage, and provide the     material means to young people who do not possess enough to keep themselves     chaste. In his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning):     “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and     the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and     capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants (female slaves). If     they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is     All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knowing (about the state of the     people)” [al-Noor 24:32], al-Qurtubi said: Marry those among you who     have no spouse, for that is the way to achieve chastity. End quote     (12/239).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the book al-Amwaal by Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn     Salaam (251) it says that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez wrote to his governor in     Iraq saying: Seek out every unmarried man who has no wealth and if he wants     to get married, then arrange his marriage and give charity to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Mughni (7/587):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    A man must keep his son chaste if he needs to get married,     and this is the apparent meaning of the view of al-Shaafa’i. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    5 – The least that societies and parents can do with regard     to this important issue is to stop going to extremes with regard to dowries,     or showing off and indulging in excess with regard to the expenses of     marriage, or trying to acquire wealth from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab delivered a speech from the minbar and     said:</p>\n<p>    “Do not go to extremes with regard to the dowries of women,     for if that were a sign of honour and dignity in this world or a sign of     piety before Allaah, then Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) would have done that before you. But he did not give any of his wives,     and none of his daughters were given, more than twelve uqiyah.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Abu Dawood (2106); classed as saheeh by     al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Wise people do not disagree on the point that parents’ going     to extremes with regard to their daughters’ dowries is one of the causes of     the spread of corruption and immorality in their societies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Will Durant said, speaking of the spread of immorality in     some western societies in some era of history in his book Mabaahij     al-Falsafah (The Pleasures of Philosophy) (127-128):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no dispute that this is to some extent due to the     demands for high dowries made by fathers as the price for their chastity at     a time when marriage was, frankly, a commodity to be bought. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    6 – One of the most important means by which societies may     ward off the evil of zina is spreading an atmosphere of love between     spouses, and striving towards the happiness of families by means of love,     respect, sincerity, loyalty, rights and duties, for happy families and     loving couples are a means of protecting society from deviation and falling     into immorality in search of illusionary happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    7 – Finally, it is essential to strive to establish a     conservative and religiously-committed environment which is connected to     Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, in which wanton display and     unveiling are unknown, and in which ‘awrahs are covered, in which alcohol     and music, which are the promoters of zina, are forbidden, because these     things are the fuel for the fire of immorality, so if the society rids     itself of them, it will be safe from that fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You may also benefit from reading the answers to the     following questions on this website: <a href=\"/en/answers/20161\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">20161</a> and     <a href=\"/en/answers/3234\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">3234</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Useful books on this subject include al-Tadaabeer     al-Waaqiyah min al-Zina by Fadl Ilaahi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

My friends are very knowledgeable and practising but they have boyfriends whom they chat to and at time meet. They have not fornicated but they do have a lot of intimacy e.g hugging, kissing etc. I do not know what to tell them, as they are aware it is wrong and regret after they have done such things. Is the ibadah od such a person accepted? Is there salah accepted and will they be rewarded. There excuse is that they are too emotionally attached and that they will be marrying that person. Please advice.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    The people who should be most committed to obeying the     commands of Allaah and heeding His prohibitions are those whom He has     blessed with guidance, knowledge of Islam and following the path of     religious commitment, so how can people like these friends whom you describe     as being religiously committed agree to follow in the footsteps of the     shaytaan by doing that which Allaah has forbidden? Should they not be     grateful for the blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon them by guiding them     to Islam and religious commitment, so they should be the best examples of     righteousness to others?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the fact that these friends of yours know that they     are doing something haraam, that counts for nothing here. Who says that mere     knowledge is what prevents a person from falling into sin? Didn’t Iblees     know that what his Lord enjoined upon him was true? Didn’t the Jews know     that the Prophet was true? And so on and so forth. Allaah, may He be     exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Do they not travel in the land, and see what was the end     of those before them? They were superior to them in strength, and they     tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these (pagans)     have done, and there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs.     Surely, Allaah wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves”</p>\n<p>    [al-Room 30:9]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And they belied them (those Ayaat) wrongfully and     arrogantly, though their ownselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those     (Ayaat) are from Allaah, and Moosa (Moses) is the Messenger of Allaah in     truth, but they disliked to obey Moosa (Moses), and hated to believe in his     Message of Monotheism]. So see what was the end of the Mufsidoon     (disbelievers, and disobedient to Allaah, evildoers liars)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Naml 27:14]</p>\n<p>    But the point here is that the one who knows, and exhorts     others, and speaks, bears a greater responsibility, and his going against     the knowledge that he has is worse and more reprehensible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and     every act of obedience to Allaah) on the people and you forget (to practise     it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture! Have you then no sense?”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:44]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not     do?</p>\n<p>    3.&nbsp;Most hateful it is with Allaah that you say that which     you do not do”</p>\n<p>    [al-Saff 61:2-3]</p>\n<p>    What you must do is remind your friends of their duties, as     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Therefore remind (men) in case the reminder profits     (them).</p>\n<p>    10.&nbsp;The reminder will be received by him who fears     (Allaah)”</p>\n<p>    [al-A’la 87:9-10]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious), when an     evil thought comes to them from Shaytaan (Satan), they remember (Allaah),     and (indeed) they then see (aright)”</p>\n<p>    [al-A’raaf 7:201]</p>\n<p>    Remind them that this is abhorrent for any Muslim, male or     female, so how about if the Muslim woman is one who outwardly makes a     display of commitment to the religion of Allaah, and sets an example for     people, and calls people to Allaah? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (3267) and Saheeh Muslim     (2989) it is narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased with him)     said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) say: “A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown     into the Fire; his intestines will spill forth and he will go around them as     a donkey goes around the millstone. The people of Hell will gather around     him and will say: O So and so, what is the matter with you? Did you not     enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil? He will say: Yes, but I used to     enjoin good and not do it, and I used to forbid evil and do it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of a scholar who teaches good to     the people but forgets about himself is that of a lamp that illuminates the     people but burns itself.” Narrated by al-Khateeb in Iqtida’ al-‘Ilm     (49) and elsewhere; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’     no. 5831.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I have seen sins deaden hearts and persisting in them may     lead to humiliation </p>\n<p>    Forsaking sin brings life to the heart and it is better for     your soul to go against whims and desires</p>\n<p>    Does anything corrupt the religion more than kings and bad     priests and monks</p>\n<p>    Who sell their souls but did not make any gain and did not     sell them for the right price</p>\n<p>    Because they are like one that feeds upon a corpse and every     wise man knows such as one is a loser.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the excuse of emotional attachment towards the     boyfriend, this is the essence of whims and desires which lead one to doom,     Allaah forbid. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires)     as his ilaah (god)? And Allaah knowing (him as such), left him astray, and     sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who then     will guide him after Allaah? Will you not then remember?”</p>\n<p>    [al-Jaathiyah 45:23]</p>\n<p>    Qataadah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: He does not     feel attracted to anything but it will control him, because he does not fear     Allaah. Tafseer al-Tabari (22/76).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah describes chaste believing women as those who avoid     having boyfriends. He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed     free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those (slaves)     whom your right hands possess, and Allaah has full knowledge about your     Faith; you are one from another. Wed them with the permission of their own     folk (guardians, Awliyaa’ or masters) and give them their Mahr according to     what is reasonable; they (the above said slave-girls) should be chaste, not     committing illegal sex, nor taking boyfriends”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:25]</p>\n<p>    Al-musaafihaat (translated here     as “committing illegal sex”) means women who fornicate or commit adultery,     who commit immoral actions. As for taking boyfriends, this refers to women     who make friends with men and take them as close friends, as Ibn ‘Abbaas and     others among the salaf said. [See: Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/261].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    By the same token, Allaah describes the chaste men who seek     what is permissible and good. He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Made lawful to you this day are At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds     of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered     eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food     (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews     and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you     in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those     who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you     have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at     the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock)     not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends.     And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allaah and in     all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allaah’s) Angels, His Holy Books,     His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al‑Qadar (Divine     Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter he will     be among the losers”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:5]</p>\n<p>    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Just as He     stipulated that women should be chaste, He also stipulated the same for men,     which means that men should also be chaste. Hence He says “not committing     illegal sexual intercourse”, which refers to those who commit     fornication or adultery, who would not refrain from any sin and would     indulge in sin whenever the opportunity arises, “nor taking them as     girlfriends,” i.e., mistresses with whom they satisfy their sexual     desires.

      "question": "<p><span>There is a girl in my locality, who holds following beliefes</span></p>\n<p><span>1. Women are more active and sometimes superior to man. </span></p>\n<p><span>2. Man can't live without woman and want her body. Do, she hates all men. </span></p>\n<p><span>3. She wears hijab and says it empowers her and gives her freedom from against the \"dominance\" of man. </span></p>\n<p><span>4.

She distorts the idea of jihad and says there's no jihad in this age. </span></p>\n<p><span>6. Once she was told how she views cooking, she replied that cooking is for man and it's not the job of woman. </span></p>\n<p><span>7. She says she's proud to be a muslim and says shes struggling to establish \"modern islam\" So, shaykh what advice I can give to her as she's my classmate</span>?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There are some positive aspects to this girl which we must point out. Her pride in Islam is something praiseworthy, as is her keenness to belong to Islam, her admiration of its values, and her commitment to its teachings, such as the hijab for example, whether she calls it modern Islam or some other name. It does not matter what she calls it if she can understand the concept behind that name in a proper manner, far removed from the influence of emotions that young people usually feel, and far away from extreme ideas that result from the crisis that the Muslim ummah is going through in reaction to the domination of modernity.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is a difference in approach between talking to an older woman who has gone through a lot of life experiences, and has read, heard and researched things, until she formed a certain conviction that what she believes is sound and it is very difficult for her to change her views – rather she strives to defend them –</p>\n<p>and talking to a young girl of sixteen, who does not have enough knowledge, education or life experience to her credit; rather she is still at the stage of growth and development, and has not yet reached the age of maturity and her ideas are not yet fully formed, and she has formed whatever ideas she has on the basis of limited experience, or merely listening to one experience of someone else, or imitating a particular person.</p>\n<p>Such ideas and thoughts that accumulate and dominate the mind of a person when he is physically and intellectually immature will quickly change, the more intellectually mature the person becomes and the more he goes through life experiences and increases in knowledge.</p>\n<p>Based on that: it is important to differentiate between the ideas of this young woman, some of which are acceptable and some are to be rejected or, more precisely, between general ideas that have nothing to do with religious principles – rather they are personal impressions that are subject to change as the person gains more experience – and religious concepts or beliefs which could have an impact on the fundamentals of religion.</p>\n<p>Her idea that women are superior in terms of energy and hard work, and her dislike of the idea that there is natural attraction between the sexes, and her suggesting that men should participate in cooking and preparation of food, are all matters that do not reach the level of beliefs or doctrines, as you mentioned at the beginning of your question. That is because they are no more than passing thoughts and personal desires that she chooses for herself and her evaluation of some permissible deeds. There is nothing wrong with her thinking about the women around her as being more active, working harder and serving others in a manner that is superior to what she sees from the men, whether they are other female students who outperform the male students – which is something that happens often – or she sees that among some outstanding women around her. That could very well be the case, and there is no doubt about it, but to be fair, we should note that women surpassing men is something rare, because if we look at men and women together as a whole, we will see that men do surpass women with regard to working hard and being active and energetic. The reality of people’s lives attests to that.</p>\n<p>Look at all nations of the world, advanced or otherwise: how many female presidents are there, how many female prime ministers, how many female ministers, how many female CEOs of large corporations or major companies, and so on?</p>\n<p>You will undoubtedly find some women in such positions, but they are very few when compared with the number of men in such positions.</p>\n<p>This fact is an affirmation that you will find in all peoples in the world, despite the differences in their religions and cultures. This confirms that men are more capable than women of successfully performing in these high positions, and that is the natural disposition that Allah has instilled in people.</p>\n<p>Also look at inventors, explorers, scholars and scientists throughout all of human history, which is not limited to the Muslims alone; what is the ratio of women to men?</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly it is very small, and women in such roles are rare.</p>\n<p>Women who are superior to some men do exist, and that cannot be denied, but their numbers are very few. This idea, in this sense, is not contrary to Islam at all. Some of the scholars have clearly stated that.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If you say: “Men are better than women,” that does not mean that each individual man is superior to each individual woman. Rather what is meant is that this category in general terms is superior to that category, even though there may be individual women who are superior to some men.\"(A<em>l-Usul min ‘Ilm al-Usul</em>&nbsp; p.36).</p>\n<p>Something similar was stated in <em>Fawatih al-Rahamut</em> (p. 1/440).</p>\n<p>Something similar may be said about her idea that men are interested in women’s bodies, and she hates men because of their gender. We do not think that these are “beliefs”, as you called them at the beginning of your question. They are not beliefs or principles of any significance or any religious dimension. Rather they are only feelings or emotions which your friend is expressing without thinking. The cause of that – as appears to be the case – is some painful experiences that she has lived through, or some unpleasant scenes or experiences that she faced or heard about, which led to her forming these impressions and phobias regarding these matters.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps that stems from some inner desire, such as thinking highly of herself or seeking to elevate herself and try to rise above her imagined weaknesses. These are just thoughts and aspirations that many people have, especially at a young age and at the time of adolescence.</p>\n<p>All of this is something that may change, or at least is something that is changeable with the first successful or beneficial experience she goes through. Her situation may easily improve with more education in the wider world beyond her narrow surroundings, so she will see the wisdom behind human integration between the male and female genders, which goes beyond the short-lived sexual dimension to an intangible spiritual dimension based on values that result from this integration between the sexes, as the Lord of Glory, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought}&nbsp;[ar-Rum 30:21].</p>\n<p>This mistaken view, even though it is held by some women, is something that we hope will change soon, before it affects the personal life of this young woman and she causes some harm to herself which she will regret when regret will not benefit her.</p>\n<p>What will help her to change her point of view – in addition to what we have mentioned above – is noting that the majority of women of different cultures and religions do not think in that way – because it is contrary to human nature. The evidence for that is the fact that the number of married women is always greater than the number of unmarried women; moreover, many of these unmarried women – in fact most of them – are not happy with their situation, and each of them wishes that she was a mother or had a family.</p>\n<p>As for her talking about the situation of women in secular countries, the reason for that, in our view, is twofold:</p>\n<p>Firstly, it stems from lack of knowledge (ignorance) of the status of women in Islamic teachings, the high esteem in which woman is held in Islam, the recognition of her rights, how Islam protects her dignity and instructs men to treat women kindly and not to mistreat them. Rather she is looking at some Muslim societies which may go against the teachings of Islam and mistreat and oppress women. Islam has nothing to do with that; rather these are mistakes and the responsibility for them rests with the one who does that and he is the one who will be brought to account for it. Such things should not be attributed to Islam.</p>\n<p>Secondly: it stems from not looking at the real situation in society in the light of official numbers and precise statistics which describe what women are going through in those secular societies, and from being deceived by some apparent freedoms for women that this girl sees here and there. In this regard, it is sufficient to draw this girl’s attention to the international acknowledgement of incidents of sexual harassment, rape and appalling sexual exploitation, news of which has reached everywhere and people everywhere talk about it, to the extent that there are reports that half of British women have faced sexual harassment of different types, according to the BBC.</p>\n<p>If you look, fairly and objectively at the following statistics, you will realize that the matter is more subtle and deeper than may appear at first to be case:</p>\n<p>1.. 10.4 million families in America are headed by single mothers who are the sole providers for their families, according to the US Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>2.. More than one million children are killed by abortion every year in the United States of America, according to the American government Centers for Disease Control.</p>\n<p>3.. 683,000 women annually are subjected to rape in America, at a rate of seventy-eight women per hour, as stated by the American Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>4.. 1320 women are killed annually, meaning that approximately four women are killed every day, by their husbands or boyfriends in America.</p>\n<p>5.. Approximately three million women every year in America are subject to physical abuse from a husband or boyfriend. Source: the official government website of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>6.. 22.1% of women in America are subjected to physical abuse by a husband or boyfriend (current or former), according to the US Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>7.. A report issued by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that most women in the West work in low-wage and low status jobs, and despite the pressure that the government exerts to improve women’s jobs, 97% of higher leadership positions in most companies are occupied by men.</p>\n<p>8.. 78% of women in the armed forces are subjected to sexual harassment from military employees.</p>\n<p>9.. In America, a woman’s body is a commodity that is traded to the extent that women are treated like animals. The aim of that is mere sexual pleasure, to the extent that some widely known restaurants there serve food on the naked bodies of women, and some car washes offer car washing services done by naked women, and waitresses serve coffee in one of the most famous restaurants wearing bikinis, as was published in major American newspapers such as the <em>New York Times</em> (18-4-2007, 24-8-2008, etc).</p>\n<p>10.. Approximately fifty thousand women and girls are trafficked into the United States every year, where they are enslaved and forced into prostitution, according to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n<p>11.. Exploitation of women’s bodies in various permissive ways is an industry that brings in twelve billion dollars annually in America alone, according to a report on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.reuters.com</a></p>\n<p>12.. Half of American women above the age of seventy-five years live alone, as noted by the American Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>13.. Women were not given the right to vote in America until 1920 CE.</p>\n<p>14.. According to a study carried out in fourteen countries, it was shown that 42% of British people admit having illicit relationships with more than one person at the same time, whilst half of Americans have illicit relationships. The rate in Italy is 38% and in France it is 36%, according to the BBC.</p>\n<p>There is an almost endless list of dark, hidden pages which speak of the situation of women in materialistic Western civilisation, all of which have been documented on official Western websites which constitute trustworthy and reliable sources for such statistics.</p>\n<p>Please see the statistics on <a href=\"http://www.alukah.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.alukah.net</a></p>\n<p>With regard to her view on jihad, it is a mistaken view, the source of which is ignorance of the rulings on jihad in Islam and the wisdom behind its prescription.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Goodness is tied to the forelocks of horses until the Day of Resurrection: reward and booty.”</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The booty that is associated with reward is only acquired by means of fighting on horses in jihad.\"(<em>Fath al-Bari</em>&nbsp; 6/56).</p>\n<p>This hadith clearly indicates that jihad will continue until the Day of Resurrection. On our website there are many questions about the rulings on jihad; please find them under the heading Jihad and Hijrah (migration).</p>\n<p>These are some ideas which we believe will help you to advise this girl.</p>\n<p>But we recommend you to let your advice to her be simply to tell her to refer to this question, or print it out for her.</p>\n<p>As for talking to her, when you are a young man and she is a girl, we think that this is something that could open the door to temptation, so you must close that door and not open it, because it may lead to something that is bad for you and her.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Criticising someone in his presence or in his absence",
      "question": "<p>Is describing a person as boring regarded as coming under the heading of backbiting (gheebah)? Please note that this person was not present when these words were spoken. Is it regarded as backbiting if these words were spoken in a moment of anger? Please advise me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave a clear definition of backbiting. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you know what backbiting is?” They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “When you say about your brother something that he dislikes.” They said: What if what I say about my brother is true? He said: “If it is true then you have backbitten about him and if it is not true then you have told a grave lie about him.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (2589).</p>\n<p>Maalik narrated in al-Muwatta’ (3/150) that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (sa) (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): What is backbiting? He said: “When you say about your brother something that he does not like to hear.” He said: O Messenger of Allah, even if it is true? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you say something untrue, then that is a grave lie.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (1992).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Backbiting only refers to speaking ill of a person in his absence, when he is not present. As for criticising him in his presence, this comes under the heading of insulting and reviling, and is also haraam.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Insulting a Muslim is an evil action and fighting him is disbelief (kufr).”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (48) and Muslim (64).</p>\n<p>And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not envy one another, do not artificially inflate prices, do not hate one another, do not turn away from one another, do not undercut one another. Be, O slaves of Allah, brothers. The Muslim is the brother of his fellow-Muslim. He does not wrong him, let him down or despise him. Piety (taqwa) is here” – and he pointed to his chest three times. “It is sufficient evil for a man to despise his Muslim brother. The whole of a Muslim is sacred to another Muslim, his blood, his wealth and his honour.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (2564).</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Ibn at-Teen said: Backbiting (gheebah) means saying about a man in his absence that which he dislikes. This was also stated by az-Zamakhshari and Abu Nasr al-Qushayri in at-Tafseer, and by Ibn Khamees in a book on this topic, and by al-Mundhiri and more than one of the scholars, one of the last of whom was al-Kirmaani. He said: Backbiting means saying behind a man’s back what he would dislike if he heard it, even if it is true. End quote from Fat-h al-Baari (10/469).</p>\n<p>Al-Jirjaani said: Backbiting means saying bad things about a person in his absence, when they are true; if they are not true, then it is a grave lie, and if it is said to his face, then it is reviling or insulting.</p>\n<p>End quote from at-Ta‘reefaat (p. 163)</p>\n<p>Conclusion: your saying about your Muslim brother that he is boring, meaning that people do not like to sit with him because his character, words and manner are tedious, comes under the heading of backbiting which is haraam, even if it is said in a moment of anger, because anger does not make it permissible to cast aspersions upon your brother who has not wronged you.</p>\n<p>There is a stern warning against backbiting that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so hasten to repent and to apologise to your brother if he has heard about what you said concerning him. If he has not heard about it, then you should seek the forgiveness of Allah, may He be exalted, and pray for your brother.</p>\n<p>See also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/23328\" target=\"_blank\">23328</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/6308\" target=\"_blank\">6308</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Her nifaas is intermittent and the bleeding is very light. Should she fast?",
      "question": "<p>I gave birth to my daughter at the beginning of the seventh month (of pregnancy), but my daughter died. This is the decree of Allah. I bled heavily for around five days, and after that the bleeding became intermittent. Blood would come once a day, sometimes it would be very little and sometimes it would be heavy. The month of Ramadan began ten days after I gave birth. Every day, before Fajr, I do ghusl and intend to fast, and some days there is blood and some days there is not. Are the fasts that I have observed regarded as valid? Is there a specific timespan for nifaas, before which it is not permitted to do ghusl? I hope you will respond, because I am very confused, and I really want to fast the holy month. May Allah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The bleeding that occurs with childbirth is called nifaas (post-partum bleeding).</p>\n<p>There is no minimum limit for nifaas. It may last for ten days or for a week, or less than that. The maximum limit of nifaas is forty days according to the more correct scholarly opinion.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/10488\">10488</a>.</p>\n<p>The end of menses can be determined by one of two signs:</p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Emission of the white discharge, which is well-known to women.</p>\n<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Complete dryness, so that if a piece of cotton or the like is inserted into that place, it comes out clean with no trace of blood or yellow on it.</p>\n<p>If you see one of the two signs, then you should do ghusl, pray and fast. If the bleeding stops but there is not complete dryness, then this means that nifaas is still ongoing. If it lasts for more than forty days, then this is istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding), unless it coincides with the usual time of your period, in which case it is menses.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who saw the blood of nifaas for two weeks, then it gradually turned into mucus that was yellowish in colour, and it continued like that until the end of the forty days. Do the rulings on nifaas apply to this discharge that followed the bleeding, or not?</p>\n<p>He replied: With regard to this yellowish discharge or mucus, so long as no clear signs of purity (i.e., the end of nifaas) appear in it, it comes under the same rulings as the blood nifaas. So the woman is not pure until this ends.</p>\n<p>End quote from  Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, p. 304.</p>\n<p>Based on that, so long as the bleeding has not ceased completely, you are still in nifaas, so it is not valid for you to fast.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

But their problem was that they did not worship Allah Alone in exclusion to others; they had other gods whom they associated in worship with Him, and which they worshipped not on the basis that they were the Lord, the Creator the Provider, but because they claimed that these were intermediaries who would intercede between them and Allah and bring them closer to Allah.

      "question": "<p>The sacrificial animal fell from the roof of our house and we slaughtered it before it died; is that permissible?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It appears from your question that you slaughtered the sacrificial animal before the Eid prayer. If that is the case, then it is not a sacrifice (udhiyah), because the condition of the sacrifice is that it should be slaughtered on the days of sacrifice, which are the day of Eid and the three following days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Jundub ibn Sufyaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was present on Eid al-Adha with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When he had finished leading the people in prayer, he looked at a sheep that had been slaughtered and said, ‘Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the prayer, let him slaughter a sheep in place of it, and whoever has not yet slaughtered (his sacrifice), let him do so in the name of Allah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 942; Muslim, 1960.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, if this sacrifice was in fulfilment of a vow, then you have to offer another sacrifice in its stead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if you slaughtered it at the time of sacrifice, and you bought it with the intention of sacrificing it, then it is valid and is a sacrifice (udhiyah), even if it was damaged as the result of its fall from the roof. See also question no. (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39191\" target=\"_blank\">39191</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the validity of your slaughtering it, it is valid if you managed to do it before it died.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has forbidden that which has been killed by strangling, and that which has been killed by a violent blow – which is an animal that dies from a blow with a piece of wood or metal – and that which has been killed by a headlong fall – like your sacrifice – and that which has been partially eaten by wild animals. This applies if the animal dies, but if people catch up with it before it dies and slaughter it in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, then it becomes halaal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al‑Maitah (the dead animals — cattle — beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns — and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal — unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:3]</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The phrase “unless you are able to slaughter it” refers to that which you are able to reach and slaughter in the proper manner when there is still evidently life in it. That refers to the phrase, “that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns — and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/11, 12&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ka’b ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that they had sheep that used to graze at Sal’ (a mountain in Madeenah): a girl of ours saw a sheep that was dying, so she broke a stone and slaughtered it with it. He said to them: “Do not eat it until I ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” He asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that and he told him to eat it.

Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.} [An-Nisa’ 4:140]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, regards the one who sits in a gathering and witnesses evil, if he does not denounce it, as being like the one who does or speaks that evil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence it is said that the one who listens is the partner of the one who backbites. According to a report, the one who witnesses sin but hates it is like the one who was absent from it, and the one who was absent from it but approves of it is like the one who witnessed it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>When some of them made fun of (the believers) and said concerning those with whom Allah is pleased, “We have never seen anyone like our people who are well-versed in the Quran when it comes to eating more or telling more lies or being more cowardly when meeting the enemy,” Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{The hypocrites fear lest a Surah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts.

Islam has only told us of these things so as to alarm people and set their hearts straight, so that they will not persist in heedlessness. One of the greatest forms of heedlessness, which is indicative of being overwhelmed by ignorance, whims and desires, and lack of insight, is when one regards matters of exhortation and admonition as a joke and something to be laughed at and made fun of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning these hypocrites who make fun of Islam:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates that they did not themselves think that they had committed an act of disbelief; rather they thought that that did not constitute disbelief. So Allah explained that ridiculing Allah and His revelations and His Messenger constituted disbelief and meant that the person had disbelieved after having believed. This indicates that they had faith, albeit weak, and they did this prohibited action knowing that it was prohibited, but they did not think that it constituted disbelief. However it was kufr by means of which they became disbelievers, although they did not think that it was permissible. (End quote from <em>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</em>, 7/273)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The one who falls into such error must renew his faith by uttering the Shahadatayn (two declarations of faith) and repent sincerely from what he has done. As for the Shahadatayn, uttering it in the prayer or in the rituals of `Umrah is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Kashshaf Al-Qina` </em>(6/181):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the disbeliever prays or gives the Adhan (call to prayer), he is deemed to be a Muslim, regardless of whether he was originally a disbeliever or had apostatised.

He must repent and must believe that he is repenting from apostasy. So he must renew his Islam, for the revelations of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and His Messenger, are too great to be mocked or ridiculed.

      "title": "He committed zina with a married woman who was estranged from her husband; can he marry her if her husband divorces her?",
      "question": "<p>There is a woman who was abused by her husband who was an alcoholic, so therefore, she left her country to come to North America. She thought she was divorced automatically because someone told her that fact she was away from her husband for one year, she becomes automatically divorced. She met a muslim man at work and he confirmed to her that she indeed was not divorced, in her situation. As they got to know each other, they fell in love and even committed zina. Finally, the woman got her divorce papers, and completed her iddah period. During the iddah, both man and woman stopped seeing each other, and felt remorse and guilt for their sins, and made taubah and repented to Allah. Theyre planning on getting married soon inshaAllah, so I wanted to know if their marriage is valid? I heard that there are a few scholars of the Maliki maddab who say that a man who spoils the marital status of a woman is not allowed to marry that woman. But most scholars have agreed that this marriage would still be valid. And the man is not sure if he falls under this category because the woman already had intention to divorce before she met him. Also, the man is of Hanafi school thought and the woman is of Shafii if this helps. Even though the majority of scholars say that marriage is valid, I wanted to be clear and know the correct view inshaAllah if they may marry and worship Allah throughout their halal marriage. Please advise.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a woman leaves her husband or a man leaves his wife for one or two years, or for more or less time than that, the marriage remains valid until the man actually divorces his wife. So long as that has not happened, and the man has not uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) to his wife, or has not written words to that effect with the intention of divorcing her, then the woman is still his wife, even if the separation has gone on for a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When is a woman regarded as divorced? He said: The woman is regarded as divorced if her husband issues a divorce (talaaq) to her when he is of sound mind and does so by choice, with no impediment to divorce such as insanity, intoxication and the like, and the woman is pure (i.e., not menstruating), during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her, or she is pregnant or postmenopausal.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa at-Talaaq, 1/35&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11681\">11681</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zina (fornication or adultery) is one of the major sins; the degree of sin is worse and the punishment is multiplied if the woman is married, because that is a betrayal of her husband … Hence the punishment for an unmarried zaani is one hundred lashes, and the punishment for a previously married zaani is stoning to death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)”</p>\n<p>Al-Isra’ 17:32].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibition on approaching it or coming near it is more eloquent than merely prohibiting the action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that may lead to it or promote it, because the one who approaches a forbidden area will soon find himself wandering in it, especially in the case of this matter which is very tempting for many people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah described zina and its abhorrent nature as a “faashishah” (something that transgresses its limits); in other words it is a sin that is regarded as immoral and odious in terms of sharee‘ah, rational thought and sound human nature, because it implies transgression of the sacred limits with regard to the rights of Allah, the rights of the woman and the rights of her family or husband, betrayal of marriage, confusion of lineage, and other negative consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words “and an evil way” mean: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to commit this grave sin.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tafseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan, 1/457&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What they must both do is repent sincerely, turn back to Allah and keep away from the things that lead to zina. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on the crime of zina and repentance therefrom, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/47924\">47924</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/138270\">138270</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that it is not permissible for the zaani to marry the zaaniyah until after they have repented sincerely, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a Mushrikah and the adulteress none marries her except an adulterer or a Muskrik (and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater, etc.) And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress, etc.)). Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:3].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Repentance is attained by regretting (what one has done) and resolving not to go back to the sin. So long as they have repented and regretted what they fell into of sin, it is valid for them to marry according to most of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman commits zina, it is not permissible for the one who knows of that to marry her unless two conditions are met:</p>\n<p>1.That her ‘iddah has ended</p>\n<p>2.That she has repented from zina.</p>\n<p>If these two conditions are met, it is permissible for the zaani or anyone else to marry her, according to the opinion of most of the scholars, including Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Jaabir, Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab, Tawoos, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, ‘Ikrimah, az-Zuhri, ath-Thawri, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ibn al-Mundhir, and ashaab ar-ra’y.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood, al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib and ‘Aa’ishah that she is not permissible (in marriage) for the zaani under any circumstances. They said: They are still zaanis whenever they are together, because of the general meaning of the verse and the report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be that what they meant by that was the period before they repent or before it is established that she is not pregnant, in which case it is the same as our view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to it being forbidden in absolute terms, that is not correct, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property” [an-Nisa’ 4:24].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because she is permissible (in marriage) for someone other than the one who committed zina with her, she is also permissible to him, like any other woman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni, 7/108.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to turn a woman against her husband because that leads to the breakup of families, even if there was a bitter dispute between the spouses. Some scholars regarded this as a major sin. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who turns a woman against her husband.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2175; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (5170) also narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever turns a man’s wife or slave against him is not one of us.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whoever turns a woman against her husband” (means) by mentioning the husband’s bad qualities to his wife, or mentioning the good qualities of another man to her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 6/159&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he said “Whoever turns a man’s wife” means: he deceives her and corrupts her, or makes the idea of divorce attractive to her so that he or someone else can marry her, and so on.</p>\n<p>‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 14/52&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our shaykh, ash-Sha‘raawi, said: That also includes the case where a woman who is angry with her husband comes to him so that he can reconcile between them, for example, so he offers her abundant food and wants to spend on her and honour her, even if that is in order to honour her husband, then her heart may be inclined to someone else and she starts to look down on her husband. This is also included in this hadeeth. The wise man should be careful with regard to such matters, even if his intention is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: I did this several times; I put pressure on the woman who was angry with her husband, and I advised my family to leave her hungry, so that she would go back and would appreciate how blessed she was with her husband.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ al-Kabeer, 6/159&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person turns a woman against her husband and spoils her for him so that she leaves him, then he marries her, his marriage is not valid and they must be separated, according to the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). This is also the view of the Maalikis. For more information on the ruling on this issue and what is meant by turning a woman against her husband, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/84849\">84849</a></p>\n<p>Based on the above, if this man is the one who turned the woman against her husband, so that she would get divorced for his sake, it is not permissible for him to marry her, especially when he has committed zina with her. There is a difference of opinion concerning marriage of the zaani to the woman with whom he committed zina. In this case he has combined two evils: turning a woman against her husband and zina.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he is not the one who turned her against her husband, as appears to be the case from the question, and he only got to know her and meet her after she had left her husband and she had left his house, then his marriage to her is valid, if she has got divorced from her first husband, on condition that they both repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from what occurred between them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Other parts of the land are infertile, but they hold the water and Allah benefits the people thereby, so that they drink it, and water their animals and irrigate their lands with it. A third part of the land is plains which do not hold the water and where no plants grow.

And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)…” [al-'Ankabut 29:1-3]</p>\n<p>In al-Sahihayn, it was narrated from Mu'adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There is no one who bears witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, truly from his heart, but Allah will protect him from the Fire.”</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Sincerity\"><strong>Sincerity</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/240287\" target=\"_blank\">purity of action</a> with a sound intention, free from any contamination of shirk. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only.” [al-Zumar 39:3]</p>\n<p>“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)…” [al-Bayyinah98:5]</p>\n<p>In al-Sahih, it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people who will be most deserving of my intercession will be those who say La ilaha ill-Allah sincerely from their hearts or their souls.”</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Love\"><strong>Love</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means love for this word and for what it implies, and its people, those who act upon it and adhere to its conditions; and hatred of whatever goes against it.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else).” [al-Baqarah 2:165]</p>\n<p>The sign that a person loves his Lord is that he gives priority to what Allah loves even if it goes against his own desires, and he hates what Allah hates, even if it is something to which he is inclined. He takes as friends those who are friends of Allah and His Messenger and he takes as enemies those who are the enemies of Allah and His Messenger. He follows His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), follows in his footsteps and accepts his guidance .All of these signs are conditions of this love, and it cannot be imagined that this love can exist without any of these conditions.</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There are three things which if a person finds them, he has found the sweetness of faith: when Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than all else; when he loves a person for no other reason than for the sake of Allah; and when he hates to return to kufr after Allah has saved him from it as he would hate to be thrown into fire.” (Narrated from the hadith of Anas ibn Malik)</p>\n<p>Some scholars added an eighth condition, which is the rejection of all things that are worshipped instead of Allah (al-kufr bi’l-taghut or rejection of false gods).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says La ilaha ill-Allah and rejects everything that is worshipped instead of Allah, his property and his blood will be sacred [i.e., it is forbidden to seize his property or shed his blood] and his reckoning will be with Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim)</p>\n<p>In order for his property and his blood to be protected, he must, in addition to saying La ilaha ill-Allah, also reject whatever is worshipped instead of Allah, no matter who or what it is.</p>\n<p>For more, please please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11819\" target=\"_blank\">11819</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114\" target=\"_blank\">114</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2585\" target=\"_blank\">2585</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on establishing festivals in which actors, singers and poets are invited to come from the country of the festival or abroad. <br />\nPlease clarify the ruling on the following: <br />\n<br />\nFirstly: What is the ruling on arranging such parties, knowing that they are about singing and music all or most of the time?<br />\n<br /> <br />\nSecondly: what is the ruling on inviting, encouraging and spending on such festivals?

      "answer": "<p>    It is haraam for the Muslim to organize parties or festivals     that include haraam things, such as singing and music, mixing of men and     women, and bringing charlatan magicians, because there is a great deal of     shar’i evidence that indicates that such things are haraam and they are     causes of people falling into that which Allaah has forbidden of immoral and     evil actions. Allaah warns those who want immorality to be spread among the     believers and promote that, and He has prepared a painful punishment for     them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, those who     like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated     among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and     in the Hereafter” [al-Noor 24:18]. Once it is established that these     parties and festivals are haraam, it is also haraam to attend them, because     they are a waste of time and money in things that are not pleasing to     Allaah, and they are cooperating in sin and transgression, and Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and     At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in     sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in     punishment” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. And in a hadeeth the authenticity of     which is agreed upon, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) forbade wasting money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah is the source of strength.

      "question": "<p>In the blessed month of Ramadan I go to pray ‘Isha and Tarawih with one of the famous reciters, who recites for a long time in Tarawih prayers. Between each two rak`ahs I sit down for a while to rest.</p>\n<p>My question is: is it permissible for me to say the opening takbir (takbirat al-ihram) with the imam when I am sitting in the row, so that I will not miss the opening takbir with the imam, and after he has recited some Quran to stand up?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Can_you_pray_sunnah_prayers_sitting_down\">Can you pray sunnah prayers sitting down?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Can_you_pray_tarawih_while_sitting\">Can you pray tarawih while sitting?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_pray_sunnah_prayers_sitting_down\">Can you pray sunnah prayers sitting down?</span></h3>\n<p>It is permissible to sit in a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13822\" target=\"_blank\">nafl prayer with no excuse</a> according to scholarly consensus, but in that case the reward of one who sits will be half that of one who stands. Imam Muslim (1214) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr who said: I was told that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer sitting is half a prayer.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: I came to him and found him <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50180\" target=\"_blank\">praying sitting down</a> . I put my hand on his head and he said: “What is the matter with you, O ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I said: O Messenger of Allah, I was told that you said: “A man’s prayer sitting is half a prayer,” but you are praying sitting down? He said: “Yes, but I am not like one of you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he prays sitting down because of an excuse, he will have the reward of one who prays standing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What is meant is: the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/67934\" target=\"_blank\">prayer of one who sits down whilst praying</a> is half the reward of the one who prays standing. This implies that it is valid but its reward is reduced. This hadith is to be understood as referring to offering nafl prayers when one is able to stand; he will have half the reward of one who prays standing. But if a person offers a nafl prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, his reward will not be reduced; rather he will have the same reward as one who prays standing. But with regard to the obligatory prayer, if a person prays sitting when he is able to stand, it is not valid and he will not have any reward for it; rather he is sinning by doing that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our companions said: if he regards doing that as permissible, this is disbelief and the rulings on apostates apply to him, as is the case if he regards zina, riba and other known haram things as permissible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he offers an obligatory prayer sitting because he is unable to stand, or he does so lying down because he is unable to stand or sit, then his reward will be like that of one who prays standing and it will not be reduced, according to the consensus of our companions. Thus the hadith is to be understood as discussing the issue of reward for one who offers a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/109254\" target=\"_blank\">nafl prayer</a> sitting when he is able to stand. This is our point of view in detail and it is the view of the majority with regard to the interpretation of this hadith.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “I am not like one of you,” according to our companions this is one of the unique characteristics of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); his nafl prayer offered sitting when he was able to stand was like his nafl prayer offered standing as an honour to him, as he was also singled out for things that are well known in the books of our companions and others, which I have listed at the beginning of my book Tahdhib al-Asma wa’l-Lughat.” (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 6/14)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_pray_tarawih_while_sitting\">Can you pray tarawih while sitting?</span></h3>\n<p>Based on that, you can say the opening takbir standing and then sit, or you may say the opening takbir whilst sitting, then when you feel more energetic you can get up, and this is better and preferable. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray at night, and when he got tired he would sit down, then when he was going to bow, he would get up and bow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I did not see the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reciting in any night prayer whilst sitting until he grew old, then he would recite whilst sitting, and when there were thirty or forty verses left of the surah, he would stand up and recite them, then he would bow. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1148) and Muslim, 731)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This indicates that it is permissible in the same rak`ah to stand for part of it and sit for part of it. This is our opinion and the opinion of Malik, Abu Hanifah and most of the scholars. It is the same whether one stands then sits, or sits then stands. Some of the early scholars disallowed that, but that is extreme. Al-Qadi narrated from Abu Yusuf and Muhammad, the two companions of Abu Hanifah, among others, that it is makruh to sit after standing, but if the person intended to stand, then he wanted to sit down, that is permissible in our view and that of the majority. Among the Malikis, Ibn al-Qasim regarded it as permissible and Ashhab disallowed it.”</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If a person joined the prayer late and the imam had made a mistake and did the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam or before it, should he do the prostration of forgetfulness again after he completes his prayer? Can the prostration of forgetfulness be done twice?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If the imam makes a mistake and does the prostration of     forgetfulness before the salaam, the one who joined the prayer late has to     follow him, because he is connected to his imam until he says the salaam.     Then when he makes up whatever he missed, he must prostrate again, because     his prostration with the imam was not done at the right point in the prayer.     The prostration of forgetfulness cannot be done during the prayer, rather     his prostrating with the imam was only because he was following the imam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam’s mistake occurred before the latecomer     joined the prayer, then he should not repeat the prostration, because the     ruling on his imam’s mistake does not apply to him, as it happened before he     joined him in prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam does the prostration of forgetfulness after     the salaam, then the latecomer should not prostrate with him, because     following the imam in this case is not possible except by saying the salaam     with him, and the latecomer cannot do that, as he does not say the salaam     until after he has completed his prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam’s mistake came before he joined him, then he     does not have to do the prostration of forgetfulness, because the ruling on     his imam’s mistake does not apply to him. But if his mistake came after he     joined him, then he should prostrate after he has said the salaam. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of the argument we have mentioned above is based on     sound reports, such as the idea that the one who is praying behind the imam     should prostrate following his imam, because the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The imam is only appointed to be     followed.” Agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And some of it is based on sound rational thinking, as     explained.

      "question": "<p>There is a young man who is 29 years old. His family sent word to him that they had proposed marriage for him to a girl whom he knows. When the news reached him, he said: She is to me as my mother's back (zihaar), and she is thrice divorced, because he did not want her. When he went to his family, he found that they had not proposed marriage to the girl for him; it was only a suggestion. But in the end, this man was convinced about this girl and wanted to marry her, and he is asking what is the ruling on what he did? Does he have to offer expiation for the zihaar or not? What is the ruling on the threefold divorce that he uttered? Please note that when he said these two things, the marriage contract had not been done with the girl; rather it was only a suggestion from his family.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Before answering this question, I should advise this brother about this conduct and foolishness. The fact that he uttered the words of zihaar and divorced her three times, before the marriage contract was done and just because he was told that a proposal had been made to her on his behalf, is to be regarded as a sign of serious haste and foolishness. The wise and resolute person is the one who controls himself and does not do anything except that which leads to good consequences. How many people have been overcome by foolishness and anger and done things which they regret later on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what he did of zihaar and divorcing this woman with whom he had not done the marriage contract, it does not amount to anything, because divorce cannot happen except after the marriage contract, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them” [al-Ahzaab 33:49]. And because divorce is for the one who has the right of intimacy with a woman, and he did not have the right to intimacy until then and did not have a marriage&nbsp; contract; and because divorce is undoing the marriage contract, and so long as he has not got married, there is nothing to be undone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to zihaar, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who make unlawful to them (their wives) by Zihaar” [al-Mujaadilah 58:3]. So zihaar is connected to their wives, and so long as the marriage contract has not been done with a woman, she is not one of his wives, so zihaar cannot apply to her. But if this man intended by means of zihaar to refrain from having intercourse with her, then he must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen) if he had married her and had intercourse with her, so as to be on the safe side and so as to discharge any obligation. As for his zihaar, it is not binding, because she is not one of his wives. Expiation for breaking an oath is freeing a slave, or feeding ten poor persons, or clothing them. If he cannot do that, then he must fast for three consecutive days. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him).&nbsp;</p>\n",

Thus, the ruling includes everyone who stands (in prayer) during Ramadan, whether in congregation or alone, in the mosque or at home.</p>\n<p>As-San`ani said:</p>\n<p>\"It is possible that it means standing (in prayer) for all its nights, and that whoever stands for part of it does not achieve the forgiveness mentioned, which is the apparent meaning.\" End quote from \"Subul As-Salam\" (4/182).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\"He (the Prophet) said: 'Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan' means the month of Ramadan, and it encompasses the whole month, from its beginning to its end.\" End quote from \"Sharh Bulugh Al-Maram\" (3/290).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in his \"Fatawa\" (24/9) with the numbering of Al-Shamilah:</p>\n<p>\"Standing (in prayer) during Ramadan is achieved by praying a portion of every night, like half or a third of it, whether that is by praying eleven Rak`ahs or twenty-three, and standing (in prayer) is achieved by praying behind the Imam of the neighborhood until he departs, even if it is for less than an hour...\" End quote.</p>\n<p>For those who miss standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan; if it was due to an excuse that prevented them from doing so, then this virtue mentioned in the Hadith is hoped for them; due to the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): \"When a servant falls ill or travels, it will be written for him as if he was doing the deeds he used to perform when he was healthy and resident.\" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2996).</p>\n<p>Al-Qastallani said:</p>\n<p>\"Whoever stands (in prayer) during Ramadan\" all its nights, or some of them when he is unable to do so, and his intention was to pray if not for the obstacle.\" End quote from \"Irshad As-Sari\" (3/425).</p>\n<p>However, if one leaves standing (in prayer) during some nights of Ramadan out of laziness, the apparent meaning of the Hadith is that he does not achieve the mentioned virtue.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is upon a Muslim to be keen on praying Tarawih in congregation in the mosque, and if he is unable or preoccupied, he should pray at home to the best of his ability.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) Mentioned in the Bible?",
      "question": "<p>What sort of references can I use to confirm that what GOD intended as regards His will, and that His will has been changed by Christian scribes/translators? Also, if you could tell me where in the Bible it speaks of the Prophet Muhammad, does it mention his name or it is symbolic?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And (remember) when ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawraat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmad, i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is plain magic’”&nbsp;[al-Saff 61:6]</p>\n<p>“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)— he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Quran) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful”&nbsp;[al-A’raaf 7:157]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These two verses indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel (the Bible), no matter how much the Jews and Christians claim that he is not, for the word of Allah is the best and most truthful of words.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the things mentioned in the previous Books are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – In the Torah, in the Book of Deuteronomy 18:18-19 it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.</p>\n<p>If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.”</p>\n<p>(New International Version)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This text is still extant among them. With regard to the phrase “from among their brothers” – if that prophet were to be from among the Children of Israel, it would have said, “I will raise up for them a prophet from among them.” But it says “from among their brothers” – i.e., from among the sons of Ismaa’eel (Ishamel).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly, it says in the Gospel of John 16:6-8, 12-13:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>“It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor [Paraclete] will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.&nbsp;</div>\n<p><sup>8</sup>When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin…</p>\n<p>I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.”</p>\n<p>(New International Version)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This cannot apply to anyone except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Secondly: Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It says in the Torah, in the fifth book [Deuteronomy 33:2]: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes [or: from his right hand went a fiery law for them].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(New International Version; alternative version of last phrase – the meaning of which is unclear in the original Hebrew texts – is from the King James Version)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This refers to the three Prophethoods: the Prophethood of Moosa (Moses), the Prophethood of ‘Eesa (Jesus) and the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). “Coming from Sinai” refers to the mountain where Allah spoke to Moosa and called him and told him he was a Prophet. “Dawning over them from Seir” refers to the appearance of the Messiah from Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). Seir is a village that is still known there to this day. So this was a foretelling of the Prophethood of the Messiah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Paran” refers to Makkah. Allah likens the Prophethood of Moosa to the coming of the dawn, and the Prophethood of the Messiah after him to the rising of the sun, and the Prophethood of the Seal of the Prophets to the sun rising high in the sky and its light reaching all over the earth. And it came to pass exactly as foretold, for Allah dispelled the night of disbelief with the Prophethood of Moosa, and the light increased with the Prophethood of the Messiah, and was completed and reached everywhere on earth with the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). These three Prophets who were mentioned in this foretelling were also mentioned in the beginning of Soorat al-Teen (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“By the fig, and the olive.</p>\n<p>By Mount Sinai.</p>\n<p>By this city of security (Makkah)”</p>\n<p>[al-Teen 95:1-3]</p>\n<p>End quote. See Hidaayat al-Hayaara, p. 110; and Ibn al-Qayyim’s comments on the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 33:1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>Fourthly: Shaykh ‘Abd al-Majeed al-Zandaani said in his book al-Bishaaraat bi Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fi’l-Kutub al-Samawiyyah al-Saabiqah that in the 22</div>\n<p><sup>nd</sup> chapter of the Gospel of Barnabas it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And this will continue until there comes Muhammad the Messenger of God who, when he comes, will expose this deceit to those who believe in the laws of God.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And it says in the Book of Isaiah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I have made your name Muhammad O Muhammad, O beloved of the Lord, your name will abide forever.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And it says in the Book of Isaiah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What I have given to him I will not give to anyone else: Ahmad, because he praises God and this praise comes from the best part of the earth, and this will bring joy to mankind and they will recite the word of divine unity on every hill and glorify God in every high place.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many scholars have mentioned the places in the Bible where the name of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned. Sometimes his name is mentioned clearly, and sometimes he is described in ways that can only apply to him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should note that the books of the Bible as they exist today have been altered and changed. This fact has been stated by non-Muslim historians, but despite all that we still find in the Bible the foretelling of the coming of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Shaykh Rahmat-Allah al-Hindi stated that every time the Christians were able to change something they did so, hence you will find that some of the ancient scholars quote passages from the Bible that no longer exist. But there are still other passages that foretell the Prophethood of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his coming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that we have to arm ourselves with adequate sound knowledge in order to debate with the Christians, because even if they have no proof, they will still try to sow the seeds of doubt in people’s hearts so that they will give in to these wrong ideas and so that the truth will be concealed. “But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it)” [al-Saff 61:8 – interpretation of the meaning].</p>\n<p>Some of the most useful books on this topic are: Izhaar al-Haqq by Shaykh Rahmat-Allah al-Hindi; Kitaab Hidaayat al-Hayaara by Ibn Al-Qayyim; and al-Jawaab al-Saheeh by Ibn Taymiyyah. And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Effect of Dad Travelling on Kids",
      "question": "<p>I travel a great deal. I travel far away from my children for a year or two, then I come back and stay with them for one month, then I travel again, and so on. All of this is for the sake of earning money and providing for my children. In recent years I noticed that their attitude has started to become bad, and I fear that they may go astray. <br />\n<br />\nWhat should I do? Should I keep on travelling in order to earn money, or should I stop travelling and go back to them?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    You should note that Allaah has placed a trust on the     shoulders of every father, and a responsibility concerning which he will be     questioned on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible     for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The     man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. The     woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her     flock.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2409; Muslim, 1829.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The first thing that the father should pay attention to,     regarding his children, is their religious commitment and morals; this will     lead to their salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families     against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are     (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the     Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tahreem 66:6]</p>\n<p>    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: This means: teach them and     discipline them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And before the responsibility of earning money and spending     on them comes the greater responsibility of ensuring that they be saved in     the Hereafter from the punishment of Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are brilliant examples of men who fulfilled this trust     and did that which Allaah had enjoined upon them with regard to their wives     and children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is a man who wakes his wife up to pray during the last     third of the night, and at Fajr he wakes up his children and takes them to     the mosque and sits with them, remembering Allaah and reading Qur’aan until     the sun comes up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Another has the habit of taking his sons with him to the     mosque to perform the five daily obligatory prayers, and when they have     finished ‘Asr prayer he stays with them in the mosque, teaching them the     Qur’aan and how to memorize it and recite it properly (tajweed), and what it     means, then they all go home together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But unfortunately there are many fathers who do not do that     which Allaah has enjoined upon them of taking care of their family’s     religious commitment and all they care about is looking after their worldly     affairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some fathers who, if their child falls sick and his     temperature rises a little, they panic and go looking for a doctor and a     remedy, which is all well and good, and is an act of compassion towards the     child, but what is strange is that they do not care if their children commit     haraam (unlawful) actions, even major sins that may doom one to Hell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    How high is the temperature of Hell?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    How can they fear a slight rise of temperature in their     child, and not worry about the fire of Hell?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some fathers who, if their child is falling behind     in his studies and not keeping up with their classmates, go crazy and lose     sleep, and worry a great deal until they bring a tutor who can help the     child advance in his studies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the children neglect their prayers or do something     haraam, or commit a major sin, they do not blame them in that case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some fathers get very angry if their child transgresses one     of their rights or ignores one of their commands, but they do not care if     the child transgresses one of the rights of Allaah or disobeys one of His     commands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a father neglects his children and does not teach them the     Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger and does not raise them     according to the basic tenets of faith and Islamic behaviour, undoubtedly     his children will go astray and will go out into society as weak and deviant     personalities, and the first ones to suffer from their corruption and     deviance will be this father and this mother who fell short in raising their     children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Hence our advice to you, if you think that your travelling     and being far away from your children will affect their upbringing and cause     them to go astray, is to go back to them and try to raise them properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What will it benefit you or your children if you amass wealth     for them but they become deviant and corrupt?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you look around you, you will see many examples of men who     travelled and left their children behind, and who suffered alienation and     loneliness for the sake of amassing wealth for their children, then they     came back with the money, but they lost something that is more important     than wealth, they lost their children, because the children went astray as a     result of their father’s absence and their mother’s negligence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The children do not appreciate what their fathers did for     their sake, and they take the money and start to curse them and mistreat them,     and even hit them sometimes, so the fathers regret deeply the fact that they     travelled and were so far away from their children… but what good is regret     when so much time has passed?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him)     was asked about the heads of families travelling. He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the heads of families travelling, if their     travel will cause harm to their families, then they should not travel,     because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “It is sufficient sin for a man that he should neglect those who are     dependent on him.” Classed as hasan (sound) by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood,     1692.&nbsp; Whether they will be harmed because of little maintenance or because of     their weakness, it is haraam (impermissible) for such a person to travel. If they will not     be harmed, but they will feel sad and will miss him, then if there is no     real benefit in travelling which brings a greater reward than his staying     with them, such as knowledge which he fears he will miss out on or a     knowledgeable person he has to meet with, then it is better for him to stay     with them. But if it is like the travel of many people, which is just for     the purpose of leisure and filling time, then it is better for him to stay     and worship Allaah at home in all cases. The person who is in this situation     should consult a knowledgeable person who knows him and what is best for him     and who is trustworthy, because people’s situations vary greatly with regard     to such matters. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/28.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to guide you and to help you to do that which     is best for you and your children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Allah blessed me and enabled me to do `umrah twice this year. The first was in Sha`ban and the second was in Ramadan. But the second time I did it on behalf of my deceased father. Will the reward of `umrah in Ramadan be recorded for me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed as to whether the one who does Hajj or `Umrah on behalf of another person will have the same reward as the one on whose behalf it is done. There are two views:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first view is that the proxy will have a reward like that of the one on whose behalf he does it, so both of them are included in the virtue mentioned in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him” and “ `Umrah during it – i.e., Ramadan – is equivalent to Hajj.”&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those who held this view quoted as evidence the general meaning of the Hadiths quoted above. They also noted that if “the one who tells others of some good deed will have a reward like that of the one who does it,” as is mentioned in the authentic Hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then it is more appropriate that the one who does an action on behalf of someone else should also receive the reward in full.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It was narrated from Dawud that he said: I said to Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyab: O Abu Muhammad, who will have the reward, the one who performs Hajj or the one on whose behalf he performs Hajj? Sa`id said: Allah, may He be exalted, so generous that He will reward both abundantly. Ibn Hazm said: Sa`id (may Allah have mercy on him) is right.” (Al-Muhalla, 7/61)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Ash-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The one who does Hajj on behalf of the deceased will have the reward of Hajj if he did that voluntarily (without being paid for it). Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Masa’il Al-Imam Ahmad, narrating from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him): I heard a man say to Ahmad: I want to do Hajj on behalf of my mother; do you think that I will also have the reward of Hajj? He said: Yes, because you are paying a debt that she owes. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the apparent meaning of what was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does Hajj on behalf of one who has died, the one who does it will have a reward like that of the one on whose behalf he did Hajj. Whoever gives food to one who is fasting with which to break his fast will have a reward like his, and whoever calls others to do some good deed will have a reward like that of the one who does it.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Ash-Shaykh (5/184)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) classed the following Hadith as inauthentic “Whoever does Hajj on behalf of one who has died, the one who does it will have a reward like that of the one on whose behalf he did Hajj”&nbsp; &nbsp; (Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da`ifah wal Mawdu`ah)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second view is that the virtue or reward mentioned in the Hadiths quoted above applies only to the one on whose behalf it is done; as for the proxy, he will have a reward for his kindness towards his brother in performing the ritual on his behalf, and for whatever acts of worship he does separately from the actions of Hajj, and that he does in the Haram, such as prayer, Dhikr and so on.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (11/77-78) it says: “Whoever does Hajj or `Umrah on behalf of another person, whether that is in return for payment or otherwise, the reward of Hajj or `Umrah will go to the person on whose behalf he did it, and there is the hope that he will also have a great reward, commensurate with his sincerity and intention to do good.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Will the one who does Hajj on behalf of another person attain the reward mentioned by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him”?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The answer to this question depends on whether this man is doing Hajj on his own behalf or on behalf of someone else. If he is doing Hajj&nbsp; on behalf of someone else and has not yet done Hajj on his own behalf, then he will not attain the reward mentioned by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he is only doing Hajj on behalf of someone else. But in sha Allah, if he intends to benefit his brother and meet his need, then Allah, may He be Exalted, will reward him.” ( Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 21/34)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: “The reward for deeds having to do with the rituals of Hajj all goes to the one who appointed him as his proxy; as for multiplying the reward for prayers and tawaf that he does voluntarily outside of the rituals of Hajj, and reading Quran, that will go to the one who is doing Hajj and not to the one who appointed him to do it on his behalf.” (Ad-Diya’ Al-Lami` min Al-Khutab wal Jawami`,&nbsp; 2/478)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This issue is one concerning which there is a difference of opinion among the scholars, and the texts concerning it are not quite clear. So to be on the safe side we should say that the issue of reward is something that Allah will decide. The Fatwa Committee issued other fatwas concerning this matter and said: With regard to a man performing Hajj on behalf of another person, and whether that is like his performing Hajj on his own behalf, or is less or more than that in terms of virtue (and reward), that is something that Allah, may He be glorified, will decide.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 11/100)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/65641\" target=\"_blank\">65641</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111407\" target=\"_blank\">111407</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/142234\" target=\"_blank\">142234</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/103849\" target=\"_blank\">103849</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/79681\" target=\"_blank\">79681</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I decided without any knowledge of Tashriq to complete the fasting of Ramadan. Do I count the 2 of the 3 days of Tashriq that I started fasting or must I start counting my ten days (due to menses and illness) after Tashriq?</p>\n",

It is prohibited to fast on these days</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of Tashriq are the days of eating and drinking.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1141, from the Hadith of Nubayshah Al-Hadhali (may Allah be pleased with him))&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The day of `Arafah, the day of Sacrifice (An-Nahr) and the days of Tashriq are our `Eid, us Muslims, and they are days of eating and drinking. (Narrated by An-Nasa’i , 3004; At-Tirmidhi, 773; Abu Dawud, 2419 – from the Hadith of `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him). THe Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not grant a concession allowing anyone to fast on these three days except for the pilgrims performing Tamattu` or Qiran types of Hajj, who did not have sacrificial animal with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (1998) narrated that `Aishah and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said: “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/42106\" target=\"_blank\">No one was allowed to fast on the days of Tashriq</a> except the (pilgrim) who did not have a sacrificial animal.”&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_make_up_missed_fasts_during_Tashriq_days\"><strong>Can you make up missed fasts during Tashriq days?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The majority of scholars said that it is not permissible to fast on the Days of Tashriq, regardless of whether that is an optional fast, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112102\" target=\"_blank\">making up a missed fast</a> or fasting in fulfillment of a vow. They said that a fast was invalid if it was observed during this time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most correct view is that of the majority, and there are no exceptions except in the case of the pilgrim who does not have a sacrificial animal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Similar fasts should not be observed on the day of `Eid Al-Adha or the Days of Tashriq, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. But there is evidence that it is permissible to fast on the days of Tashriq for the pilgrim performing Tamattu` or Qiran Hajj in lieu of offering the sacrifice, especially those who are unable to offer the sacrifice. But fasting them on a voluntary basis or for any other reason is not permissible, as in the case of `Eid.”&nbsp;(Fatawa Ramadan, compiled by Ashraf `Abd Al-Maqsud, p. 716)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is permissible for the pilgrim performing Tamattu` or Qiran, if he cannot find a sacrificial animal, to fast these three days so that he can fast them during the Hajj season. But apart from that it is not permissible to fast these days; even if a person is fasting two consecutive months, he must not fast on the day of `Id and the three days that follow it, then he should resume his fasting.”&nbsp;(Fatawa Ramadan, p. 727)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, the fasts that you observed on the Days of Tashriq to make up for missed Ramadan fasts, are not valid, and you must repeat them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When making up missed Ramadan fasts, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21697\" target=\"_blank\">the days need not be consecutive</a> , so you can make up the missed fasts on consecutive days or on separate days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "There is no hadeeth which says that having an easy pregnancy is a sign of special mercy from Allah",
      "question": "<p>im 8 months pregnant &amp; Alhamdulillah my husband is very caring and humble towards me now. i have read hadiths that if a husband is pleasing and humble during pregnancy she will get much reward ...is it so?<br />\n<br />\nAlso i have read that Aisha R.A. said Allahs mercy will be more on a women by following 3 signs 1. her demand 2. her engagement 3. her pregnancy will be made easy...is it so?<br />\n<br />\nBut i am sleepless,restless, also due to sugar daily i have to inject insulins due to which i am also suffering from itches, severe leg pain, white discharge problem due to which after every compulsory prayer again i have to repeat wudoo for sunnath prayers ....now i am fed up and decided not to have any child hereafter...does it mean I am not good or i am not completely under Allahs mercy...</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      We have not       found anything in the saheeh Sunnah or the reports from the Sahaabah and       Taabi‘een to indicate that an easy pregnancy is one of the signs of       special mercy from Allah, may He be exalted, to a woman. That is one of       the matters of the unseen regarding which we must adhere to what is       mentioned in the texts and reports, and not attribute any such thing to       the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) unless we are       certain of it and that it is saheeh. Allah, may He be glorified and       exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And     follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of     which you have no knowledge (e.g. ones saying: \"I have seen,\" while in fact     he has not seen, or \"I have heard,\" while he has not heard). Verily! The     hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be     questioned (by Allah)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’     17:36].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the     mercy of Allah, may He be exalted, may be in wellbeing, but it may also be     in trials and tests, according to the knowledge and wisdom of Allah, may He     be glorified and exalted. It was narrated from Muhammad ibn Khaalid, from     his father, from his grandfather – who was a companion of the Messenger of     Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – that he said: I heard the     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If a     certain status has previously been decreed by Allah for a person, and he     does not attain it by his deeds, Allah afflicts him in his body or wealth or     children.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by     Abu Dawood in as-Sunan, no. 3090. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.     This hadeeth indicates that if a woman is tested with difficulty and     hardship in pregnancy, that may be a sign of Allah’s mercy towards the woman     and of what she will have with Allah of reward and great status, especially     if we remember the hadeeth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be     upon him) in which he said:         “There is no calamity that befalls a Muslim but he is expiated thereby, even     a thorn that pricks him.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by     al-Bukhaari (5640) and Muslim (2572).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thus it is     clear that whoever wants to attain the mercy of Allah, may He be exalted,     let him be patient at the time of calamity and let him be grateful at the     time of blessing, for in that case he will be in a very good state and will     not be distracted by thinking about what Allah, may He be exalted, intends     by this calamity, for that is one of the matters of the unseen of which he     has no knowledge, but by being grateful and showing patience, he will attain     the mercy and good pleasure of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sufyaan     ath-Thawri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no     one who understands Islam but he regards calamity as a blessing, and ease as     a calamity. </p>\n<p>    End quote from    Hilyat al-Awliya’ (7/55).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    One of the     earlier generations said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Be content     with Allah in all that He does to you, for He does not withhold from you     except in order to give you, and He does not put you through trials except     in order to bring about your well-being, and He does not cause you to be     sick except in order to heal you, and He does not cause you to die except in     order to bring you back to life. So beware of failing to be content with Him     even for a moment, lest you be deprived of mercy.</p>\n<p>    End quote from    Madaarij as-Saalikeen, 2/216&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if there     is some symptom of illness that prevents you from having another child, that     does not indicate that you are a bad woman or that you have been cast away     from the mercy of Allah – Allah forbid. Rather that is a common occurrence     and there is no blame on you.     “and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any     hardship”[al-Hajj 22:78].     But we also think that the difficulty and hardship that you are facing at     present mean that this is not an appropriate time to take such a decision.     How many women have thought in such situations the same as you are thinking     now, but when Allah made the birth easy for her and she had rested for a     while after that hardship, she once again began to long for pregnancy and     childbirth, and to raise little ones. Perhaps if Allah makes the birth easy     for you – in sha Allah – and you rest for a while after that, maybe Allah     will help you with another pregnancy. But it is too early to make such a     decision now&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more     information, please see fatwas no. <a href=\"/en/answers/161204\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">161204</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/150171\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">150171</a></p>\n<p>    And Allah     knows best. </p>\n",
