      "title": "Is it permissible for him to open a business offering treatment with ruqyah and cupping?",
      "question": "<p>I am a young Muslim man who is among those who call people to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. Three years ago I started to recite ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah for people, according to proper guidelines but not in any organized fashion, in return for money which I use on some of my needs. Allaah decreed that my ruqyahs be accepted and Allaah has healed many people at my hands and guided others to the right path and helped them to believe in His Oneness and to keep away from shirk, despite the hassles that I have faced from some of the charlatans, biased people and those who seek to prevent shar’i ruqyah which they describe as bid’ah and haraam earnings. Too many people started coming to me and urging to help them because there are no people who devote their time to reciting ruqyah. All of these people are coming to me for ruqyah in my home which is very humble, which causes me a lot of hardship and difficulty, and it bothers my family because people knock at the door so much, and I have started to neglect my other duties because of reciting ruqyah for them because I feel too shy to refuse. I thought of renting a place which I can use specifically for reciting ruqyah as prescribed in sharee’ah and cupping in return for approximately 20 riyals for doing ruqyah for one person, and that charge will go towards paying the rent and some of my essential needs. But I was surprised when some Muslims who claim to have knowledge denounced me for specializing in this and said that specializing in this was a bid’ah and was not known among the salaf of this ummah, and that money earned in this way is haraam. <br />\n<br />\nIt is permissible to open a clinic for ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah and cupping in return for money, especially since I am in need and am not well off, and I have responsibilities towards my family, and I am suffering from a chronic illness and cannot do heavy work, and the Muslims are in need of someone who can specialize in ruqyah and call them to Tawheed and forbid them from shirk? <br />\n<br />\nIf it is permissible to open a Qur’aanic clinic, then after that I find a job, there are further questions to be answered: <br />\n<br />\n1-  Should I stop doing ruqyah and take this job even though this would result in several negative consequences such as not being able to do this good deed and this will create a vacuum in this area?<br />\n<br />\n2-  Should I combine both and try to reconcile between them without letting one of them affect the other?<br />\n<br />\n3-  Should I refuse to work and be content with doing ruqyah because it benefits others and serves the interests of the Muslims? <br />\n<br />\nIf it is not permissible to open a Qur’aanic clinic: <br />\n<br />\n1-   Should I stop doing ruqyah altogether?<br />\n<br />\n2-   Is it better to carry on doing ruqyah in my house and not specialize in it, and put up with people’s annoyances?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the situation is as described, that you recite ruqyahs     that are prescribed in sharee’ah and the people really need that, then we     ask Allaah to reward you and help you and guide you. There is nothing wrong     with you receiving payment in return for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: We     heard of some people who treat others by means of the Qur’aan; they recite     Qur’aan and du’aa’s that are prescribed in sharee’ah over water or olive oil     as a remedy for witchcraft, the evil eye and madness (the touch of the     shaytaan), and they receive payment for that. Is this permissible according     to sharee’ah? Does reciting over water or olive oil come under the same     ruling as reciting over the sick person himself?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with receiving payment for reciting     ruqyah for one who is sick, because it is proven in al-Saheehayn that     a group of the Companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they made came near     one of the Arab tribes. (These people were either kaafirs or very stingy, as     Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in al-Madaarij). They asked them for hospitality but     they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they     tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why don’t     you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have     something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been     stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you     have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allaah. I will perform ruqyah for     him, but by Allaah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us     anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something     in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on     him and recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen. Then he recovered     quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong     with him. Then they have them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the     Sahaabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said,     Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see     what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He     said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” Then he said, “You did the     right thing.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2115) and Muslim(4080).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with reciting over water or olive oil     to treat the sick person, the one on whom a spell has been cast or the one     who is insane, but reciting over the patient and blowing over him is better     and preferable. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated with a     hasan isnaad that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) recited over water for Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas and poured it over     him. And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah that does not involve shirk.” Muslim     (4079). This saheeh hadeeth is general in meaning and includes ruqyah     recited over the patient himself and ruqyah recited over water and olive oil     etc. And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz     (19/338).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about a man     who performed ruqyah for people in return for payment, and he did not know     anything but that which was proven from the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he referred to the books of     trustworthy scholars concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the situation is as you describe and you treat the sick     with ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah, and you do not recite any     ruqyahs except those that are proven from the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), and you are keen to refer concerning that     to that which was stated by the great scholar Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have     mercy on him) in his well known books, and what was written by the great     scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Zaad     al-Ma’aad and other similar books by Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, then     you work is permissible, and your efforts are appreciated and will be     rewarded in sha Allaah. And there is nothing wrong with you receiving     payment for that, because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah     be pleased with him) to which you referred in your question. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri is the hadeeth mentioned     above, about reciting al-Faatihah as a ruqyah for the man who had been stung     by a scorpion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As ruqyah is permissible and it is permissible to receive     payment for it, it makes no difference whether that is in your home or in a     rented place, or in separate premises, so as to ward off hardship for the     family at home. There is no basis for those who object to that on the     grounds that it is not known that the salaf earned a living in this manner;     once it is proven that job is permissible and that being paid for it is     permissible, the view that this profession is haraam is the view of one who     speaks without knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari said in his Saheeh in Kitaab al-Ijaarah     (the Book of Employment): Chapter on what is given for reciting the Opening     of the Book (al-Faatihah) as a ruqyah for an Arab tribe. Ibn ‘Abbaas     narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):     “The most deserving thing for which you receive payment is the Book of     Allaah.” End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/71303\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">71303</a> we stated that there is a     difference of scholarly opinion with regard to receiving payment for     cupping. The correct view is that it is permissible and is not haraam. The     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only disallowed it     in the sense of it being makrooh, not haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing wrong with you opening a clinic to treat     people with ruqyah and cupping, as stated above. Even if you find other     work, you do not have to give up ruqyah; you could combine both types of     work if you think that is appropriate, without it affecting you or your     family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If treating the sick with ruqyah offers a good opportunity to     call them to Allaah, advise them and direct them towards what is good – as     you say – then you should not give up this work, even if other work becomes     available to you. This is a way of doing good to others. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The one who offers this treatment should remember that Allaah     is always watching him, in secret and in public, so he should be easy going     with people and not press them for payment or the cost of the treatment, and     he should remind them that healing is in the hand of Allaah alone. He should     remind them to repent to Allaah and give up the sins that lead to many     problems and calamities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Keeping Pets in Islam: Allowed?",
      "question": "<p>I am ten years old and I would like to keep a pet. Are there any guidelines concerning that? If there is anything, please draw our attention to it.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Keeping_pets_in_Islam_Allowed\">Keeping pets in Islam: Allowed?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Conditions_ofnbspkeeping_pets_in_Islamnbsp\">Conditions of&nbsp;keeping pets in Islam&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>We are very happy to receive questions from our youth such as you, who love Allah and His Messenger and who are smart and intelligent. This question is important and useful and is asked in a brief and polite manner. We ask Allah to look after you and take care of you and to reward with good everyone who has contributed to your good upbringing.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Keeping_pets_in_Islam_Allowed\">Keeping pets in Islam: Allowed?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/14422\" target=\"_blank\">Keeping and raising pets</a> is something that is permitted in Islam and there is nothing wrong with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (6203) and Muslim (2150) narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the best of people in attitude. I had a brother who was called Abu ‘Umayr. He (the narrator) said: I think he said: He was a weanling. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and saw him, he said: “Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to the nughair (nightingale)?” He used to play with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It indicates that it is permissible for children to play with birds, and it is permissible to spend money on permissible things that will entertain children, and it is permissible to keep birds in cages and the like, and to clip the wings of birds, because one or the other must have been done in the case of Abu ‘Umair’s bird, and whichever is the case, the other comes under the same ruling.” (Fath al-Bari, 10/584)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Conditions_ofnbspkeeping_pets_in_Islamnbsp\">Conditions of&nbsp;keeping pets in Islam&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the conditions and guidelines on keeping animals, these include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. The animal that is kept should not be a dog, because <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69777\" target=\"_blank\">Islam has forbidden keeping dogs</a> except guard dogs and hunting dogs. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3225) and Muslim (2106). Would the Muslim be happy for the angels of mercy not to accompany him in his house because of an animal he is keeping?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Not going so far with regard to this matter that it reaches the stage of blameworthy extravagance. We have seen some people who pay thousands and even millions competing to buy a certain animal or take care of it and provide services for it. Some of them even bequeath some of their wealth to them. In some countries, there are festivals and shows for all kinds of animals, on which huge amounts of money are spent. All of this is foolishness and lack of common sense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. The animal must be treated kindly. If a Muslim keeps an animal, he must provide it with proper food and drink, and not cause it any harm or injury by mistreating it or using it for target practice or making animals fight one another, or exposing it to heat or cold. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst a man was walking on the road, he became very thirsty. He found a well so he went down into it and drank, then he came out. There he saw a dog that was panting and biting the ground out of thirst. The man said: this dog is feeling the same thirst that I felt. So he went back down into the well and filled his shoe with water, then he held it in his mouth until he climbed back up, and he gave the water to the dog. Allah appreciated (his action) and forgave him.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, will we have a reward with regard to these animals? He said: “In every living thing there is reward.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Look at how the believer will be rewarded for taking care of animals; rather he may even enter Paradise because of his kind treatment of a single animal, as happened to the man mentioned in this hadith. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, loves those who do good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us of a woman who went to Hell because of her neglect of a cat which she detained and it died of hunger; she did not feed it or let it go and eat of the vermin of the earth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3004\" target=\"_blank\">3004</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7004\" target=\"_blank\">7004</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22373\" target=\"_blank\">22373</a> ,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to stand for a minute’s silence in mourning for a man who has died?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What some people do, of standing in silence for a moment, as a salute to the martyrs or prominent figures, or to honour and show respect to their souls, and in mourning for them, is a reprehensible act and an innovation, that was not done at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or at the time of his Companions or the righteous earlier generations. It is not in accordance with the etiquette of Tawheed or sincere veneration towards Allah. Rather it is done by some Muslims who are ignorant of their religion, following the invention of this practice by the disbelievers, and imitating them in their reprehensible customs and their exaggeration about their leaders and prominent figures, both living and dead. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade us to imitate them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is customary in Islam is that the duty of the Muslim is to pray for their dead, to give charity on their behalf, to mention their good qualities and refrain from speaking of their bad qualities… And there is a great deal of etiquette that has been explained by Islam and that the Muslim is encouraged to pay attention to with regard to his brothers, both living and dead. However that does not include standing for a moment’s silence in honour of the martyrs or prominent figures; Rather this is something that is contrary to the principles of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength.

      "title": "She used to wipe over socks for varicose veins that do not cover the toes, as if wiping over khuffayn; what is the ruling on her prayer?",
      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>My mother is elderly and has varicose veins in her legs. For quite some time she has been wearing special stockings on her legs from halfway up the foot up to the knee; i.e., the end of the foot is uncovered. She says that when doing wudoo’, she did wudoo’ as usual, then when she reached the feet she wiped over the socks mentioned. She did that for a while until she stopped using the socks, and that was because it was too difficult to take them off and put them on again. She did not ask about the ruling at that time, because she thought that this was permissible so long as it was wiped.</div>\n<p>Now she is asking about the ruling on her prayers during this period?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to wiping over the khuffayn or socks, it is stipulated that the sock should cover the place that must be washed, and the place that must be washed goes from the ends of the toes to the ankles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to wipe over the khuffayn and the like if it covers the place that must be washed. If any part of the place that must be washed is not covered, then it is not permissible to wipe over it.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni, 1/183&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not allowed to wipe over the socks and so on unless the conditions stipulated in sharee‘ah are met, one of which is that the socks should cover the place that must be washed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 10/114&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The socks mentioned in the question do not come under the ruling on wiping over the khuffayn, because they do not cover the place that must be washed. But if the sick person needs to wear them and it is difficult for him to take them off every time he does wudoo’, then he may do wudoo’ before putting them on, and then put over them socks that cover properly. Then when he needs to do wudoo’, he can wipe over the socks that are covering them, until he takes them off or the period during which wiping over the socks is permissible ends. This is something acceptable and there is nothing wrong with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is not able to do that, and taking off the medical sock is something that will cause him harm or delay his recovery, then it comes under the same ruling as plaster casts; he may wipe over the entire thing, top and bottom – and this is one of the differences between wiping over plaster casts and wiping over the khuffayn: the entire cast should be wiped, whereas only the top of the khuffayn is wiped – and the uncovered part of the foot should be washed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114192\">114192</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What your mother should have done was ask about what was required in that situation. The fact that she did not ask indicates that she was careless; we ask Allah to forgive her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to making up the prayers that she offered in that situation, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning that. Some of the scholars say that the prayers must be made up and some say that it is not obligatory to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If she wants to be on the safe side and make up the prayers that she offered with that wudoo’, that will be better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is too difficult for her to do that or the days on which she offered prayers in that state were many, then she may be excused for not knowing, if she thought that what she was doing was correct and it did not occur to her to ask about it. In that case she does not have to repeat them according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45648\">45648</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on eating fruits picked from trees in the mosque or its gardens",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to pick fruits from the garden of the mosque in return for putting some money in the mosque collection box? Thank you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The majority of fuqaha’ are of the view that it is makrooh to     plant trees in the mosque, and some of them are of the view that it is     haraam, and some of them limited the prohibition to those that take up space     that should be for the worshippers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The reason why it is makrooh is that the mosque was not built     for that purpose, rather it was built for the remembrance of Allaah, prayer     and reading Qur'aan, and because the tree may damage the mosque and prevent     worshippers from praying in the spot where it is located, and its leaves and     fruits will fall in the mosque, and birds will come to it and defecate in     the mosque, and children may come to the mosque because of the tree and     throw stones at it to make its fruits fall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of them gave the reason for it being makrooh as being     because it is making the mosque similar to the synagogues of the Jews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not     permissible to plant a tree in the mosque. This was stated by Ahmad, who     said: If the date palm was planted after it became a mosque, then this was     planted unlawfully, and I would not like to eat from it. If the imam uproots     it, that is permissible, because the mosque was not built for that purpose,     rather it was built for the remembrance of Allaah, prayer and reading     Qur'aan, and because the tree may damage the mosque and prevent worshippers     from praying in the spot where it is located, and its leaves and fruits will     fall in the mosque, and birds will come to it and defecate in the mosque,     and children may come to the mosque because of the tree and throw stones at     it to make its fruits fall.. End quote from al-Mughni (5/370).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In al-Fataawa al-Hindyyah (1/110) it says: It is     makrooh to plant trees in the mosque, because that is making it like a     synagogue, and because it takes space away from the worshippers , unless it     will be of benefit to the mosque, such as if the land is wet and unstable     and the pillars would not be steady, so trees are planted therein to reduce     the instability. This is what it says in the Fataawa of Waadi Khaan.     End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn al-Humaam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not     permissible to plant trees in it unless the land is wet and unstable and the     pillars are not steady, in which case it is permissible in order to absorb     that water and bring about some benefit. End quote from Fath al-Qadeer     (1/421).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Zakariya al-Ansaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: And     it is makrooh (to dig a well or plant trees in it), rather if that causes     harm it is haraam (and the imam may remove it) lest it take space away from     the worshippers. Al-Adhra’i said that planting trees in a mosque that is     structurally sound is haraam because it takes space away from the     worshippers, and causes problems, and brings impurities from bird lime. And     he narrated from a number of the Iraqis that planting anything is not     allowed. End quote from Asna al-Mataalib (1/186).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Sharh al-Kharashi ‘ala Khaleel (7/48) it says:     Note: a number of scholars clearly stated that it is not allowed to plant     anything in the mosque. They said it is not permissible to dig therein or to     bury anyone therein. They said: Perhaps those who said it is makrooh meant     that it is makrooh in the sense of being haraam. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thus it is clear that the fuqaha’ said it is either haraam or     makrooh. This applies to things that are planted in the mosque after it is     built. But if there were any plants on the land before the mosque was built,     and the mosque is built around it, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said, in the passage quoted above: If there was     a date palm on the land, and its owner made it into a mosque and the date     palm is incorporated into it, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also seems that there is nothing wrong with there being     trees in a garden attached to the mosque, so long as they do not take away     any space from the worshippers and their leaves do not cause any problem for     the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to eating the fruits of these trees, that is     subject to further discussion. If the one who set up the waqf donated the     trees along with the mosque and specified on what the waqf was to be spent,     by stating that it is for the poor, or for imams or students or the mosque,     for example, then his request is to be followed. What has been donated as a     waqf to the mosque should be sold and spent on the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – If he did not specify how the waqf was to be spent, then     there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. It was said that     the ruling is the same as that for which the beneficiaries are not     stipulated, so it should be given to the heirs of the original donor as a     waqf for them, or it was said that it is permissible for the poor of the     mosque, or that it may be spent on the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – In the case of that which is planted in the mosque but     was not given as a waqf along with it, and which we have ruled to be makrooh     or haraam, if it was planted for the mosque then nothing should be taken     from it without paying something to the mosque in return. If it was planted     for the sake of Allaah or it is not known for what purpose it was planted,     it is permissible to eat from it, but it is better not to eat from it, but     if a person eats from it and donates something for the upkeep of the mosque     in return, there is no sin on him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There follow some comments of the fuqaha’ on this issue:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said in the same place as quoted above: If its     owner says: This is a waqf for the mosque, then its fruits should be sold     and the price donated to the mosque.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Safareeni (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Question:     Ruling on eating the fruits of trees belonging to the mosque. In     al-Furoo’, al-Insaaf, al-Iqnaa’, al-Muntaha, al-Ghaayah     and elsewhere, it says that if they are not removed, then their fruits are     for the poor of the mosque. It says in al-Insaaf: al-Haarithi said:     This is our view. He said: It is more likely that they are permissible for     other poor people too. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I     would not like to eat from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If it was planted before the mosque was built and was given     as a waqf along with it, then if (the donor) specified how (the fruits) were     to be disposed of, his wishes should be followed, otherwise it should be     given to the heirs of the donor, both rich and poor, as a waqf to them     according to their shares of inheritance. They are entitled to it as an     inheritance. If he has no relatives then it is for the poor and needy as a     waqf for them. al-Muwaffaq said: It is permissible to eat from it, and this     is the view of Imam Ahmad according to the report narrated by Abu Taalib.     ... A number of our companions said: It should be (sold and the money) spent     on the mosque, and if there is no need of it then its neighbour may eat the     fruits. He stated this in al-Faa’iq. But he stated the former view,     that if no particular recipient is stipulated then it is like a waqf for     which no recipient were stipulated, in al-Iqnaa’, al-Muntaha     and al-Ghaayah. (2/317).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Haashiyat al-Bujayrimi (3/103) it says: It is     makrooh to plant trees in the mosque as it says in al-Rawdah. I say: This is     to be understood as meaning that it is makrooh if it does not affect the     mosque or the worshippers, otherwise it is haraam and if it has been planted     it should be uprooted. The one who should uproot it is the imam or his     deputy, not individuals, whether it was haraam or makrooh to plant it,     because he has the right to remove makrooh things. But it is not permissible     to cut down that which was planted for the mosque and is not causing any     harm, because it belongs to the mosque. This was stated by al-Qaadi. But it     should be limited to that which bears fruits from which the mosque may     benefit, otherwise it should be removed. The basic principle dictates that     attention should be paid to whichever serves the greater interest: leaving     it or removing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of things that were planted for the mosque but     deserve to be removed, it is not permissible to eat their fruits unless one     makes a donation to the mosque in return. If they were planted to provide     food for the sake of Allaah or the intention of the one who planted them is     unknown, it is permissible to eat from them without paying anything in     return. The same applies to the fruits of trees planted for the sake of     Allaah in the graveyard or if the intention of the one who planted it is not     known, and the same applies to plants that grew there by themselves. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said: Abu’l-Khattaab said: In my view, if the     mosque needs the price of the fruits of the trees, they may be sold and the     price given towards upkeep of the mosque. He said: Ahmad’s view is that the     neighbours may eat them, which may be understood as meaning that they attend     the mosque and take care of it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this, if the fruits of the garden asked about here     were donated as a waqf for a specific cause, then it is not permissible for     anyone but the specified recipients to eat from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If they were planted for the sake of Allaah, it is     permissible to eat from them without paying anything in return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If they were given as a waqf or planted for the benefit of     the mosque, then they should be sold and the money spent on the mosque. If a     person takes some of them and puts some money in the mosque collection box     in return, then he has done the right thing. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on tethering animals and detaining them in order to feed them and fatten them",
      "question": "<p>We work with livestock, fattening bulls. If we leave the bulls in the field to walk and play, then no matter what we feed them they will not grow as fat as bulls that are tethered. Personally, I do not tether the bull because I feel sorry for it, and because I regard that as torturing the animal. As for my relatives, all of them tether the livestock, and they laugh at me and say: Why are you so emotional and forbid what Allah has permitted? If that was prohibited, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have forbidden it. So what is the ruling on tethering bulls to fatten them for 5 or 6 [days] or more, so that a single bull will be 90 centimetres or less, and that the animal cannot scratch itself or drive away flies from itself, and for all that time it cannot move. It is for this reason that sometimes its legs become swollen.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to torture or harm animals, such as detaining them and not feeding them, or hitting them unnecessarily, or branding them on the face, because of the prohibition in the religious texts on doing such things, as in the hadith of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat that she detained, and did not feed it or let it loose to eat from the vermin of the earth, until it died.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3140; Muslim, 2242.</p>\n<p>According to a version narrated by al-Bukhari: “A woman was punished because of a cat that she detained until it died of hunger, and she entered Hell because of it.” And he said: “Allah knows best. Allah said (to the woman): You gave it neither food nor water when you detained it, and you did not let it loose to eat from the vermin of the earth.”</p>\n<p>What is meant by the vermin of the earth is insects and pests.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah have mercy on him) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he forbade capturing any animal for the purpose of killing it (for sport). Narrated by Muslim (1959).</p>\n<p>What is meant by killing it for sport is detaining it until it dies or shooting it with arrows and the like.</p>\n<p>It was also narrated from him (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade striking on the face or branding on the face. Narrated by Muslim, 2116.</p>\n<p>And it was narrated from him (may Allah be pleased with him) that a donkey that had been branded on the face passed by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: “May Allah curse the one who branded him.” Narrated by Muslim, 2117.</p>\n<p>From the hadith about the cat, it may be understood that if animals are detained and fed, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>Al-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From this it is understood that simply tying up an animal that is owned by someone is not prohibited, because condemnation only applies to not feeding animals or letting them loose to find food themselves.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is prohibited to kill cats and it is prohibited to detain them without giving them food or drink.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Tarh at-Tathrib</em>, 8/243.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From this hadith it is understood that if animals are given sufficient food and drink, then there is nothing wrong with [detaining them].</p>\n<p>That includes birds that are kept in cages, if they are given food and drink in sufficient amounts, and they are protected from heat and cold, then there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>But if they are not given sufficient food and drink, and they die because of that, then the person who does that will be punished for it.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Sharh Riyad as-Salihin</em>, 6/293.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with tethering animals if they are fed, and tethering them is not regarded as torturing them. The Muslims have always tethered their animals in order to protect them and for other reasons without anyone criticizing them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) tethered Buraq, as Muslim (162) narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Buraq – which is a tall white beast, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule, whose stride reaches as far as he can see – was brought to me and I rode it until I reached Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets, and I entered the mosque.”</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (2517) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: A man said: O Messenger of Allah, should I hobble it [my camel] and put my trust in Allah, or should I let it loose and put my trust in Allah? He said: “Hobble it and put your trust in Allah.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Mukhtar as-Sihah</em>, p. 215:&nbsp; What is meant by hobbling the camel is tying up one of its forelegs with a rope [so that it cannot stray]. End quote.</p>\n<p>This indicates that it is permissible to tether animals.</p>\n<p>This tethering does not harm the animal and does not prevent it from driving off flies or scratching its skin, because it drives away flies with its tail and it scratches its skin on the walls and the like that are around it.</p>\n<p>But if we assume that someone ties the rope on the animal too tightly when tethering it, to the extent that he harms it, then he should be advised to loosen the rope a little, and to avoid harming and hurting the animal as much as possible.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Their mother prevented them from taking their share of their father’s estate, and issues concerning the fairness of giving (to one’s children)",
      "question": "<p>A man died and left behind a wife and three sons (two of them are under 21 meaning underage), and two daughters, one of them was married before the father died. The other daughter and one of the sons have finished their education and are working now, while the other two sons are still having their education.  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother was working with the father. And they used to save their salaries together, and she approved to this of course (she used to say to him: “what matters is that I take the bonus of retiring, and this is what already happened) while the husband takes what they both save and buy properties in his name. <br />\n<br />\nThe questions: <br />\n<br />\nWhen the heirs divide the heritage, should they count the mother’s salaries and discount it from the entire heritage, then divide what remains on all of them (mother, two daughters and three sons)? The mother says that the heritage will not be divided before every one finishes his education and gets married. Then the heritage will be divided according to the Islamic Sharia, boy’s share is double the girl’s one. Is this permissible? When should the heritage be divided according to Sharia?  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother does not want anyone of the children to know how much the heritage exactly is so that no one says I should take more than my share when time of dividing comes. Is that permissible?  <br />\nBefore the father died he bought a car and wrote it in his oldest son’s name according to his wife’s wish. As this son’s position allows him to easily return the licence if it was taken for some reason. The father had the intention to buy a car for every one of his children for the same price, and to buy a car for half of that price for the unmarried daughter. He paid more than half the price of it already before he died. He had the intention to give the married daughter as much as he would give the unmarried one as well.  <br />\n<br />\nAfter the father died the mother said: “the car is for the eldest son, his father bought it for him because he is obedient, and the father is free to give whoever he wills of his children from his own money, as long as the son is obedient” and as for the car of the unmarried daughter, the mother reclaimed the money as she cannot continue paying the other half, because if she withdraws money from the bank, the whole heritage will be transferred to the “welfare trust”, which will keep the shares of the underage children aside. She will not then be able to do anything about the underage children’s shares except via the welfare trust. Is that permissible?  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother’s reasons for not dividing the heritage are, as I said, the welfare trust. She says about the underage children: “is it fair that I spend on them until they grow up and after that they take their whole shares regardless what I spent on them of my own money?  <br />\n<br />\nThe mother asked her three older children to grant her power of attorney that allows her to have full control of the heritage. She will also ask the underage children to do the same when they reach the legal age for this. What is the ruling of every point of the above mentioned? <br />\n<br />\nMay Allah reward you and accept your deeds purely for His sake. Sorry for the long inquiry.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The basic     principle concerning the wife’s wealth is that it belongs to her and it is     not permissible for her husband to take it or to take any part of it without     her consent. Allaah has forbidden consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, but     He has given permission to the husband to take some of his wife’s wealth if     she gives it up willingly, with no force or compulsion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who     believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a     trade amongst you, by mutual consent”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’     4:29]</p>\n<p>    “And give     to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by     the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart; but if     they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and     enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’     4:4]</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a wife     gives her salary to her husband willingly, then it is a donation from her     which becomes his property when he takes possession of it. Based on this, no     attention should be paid to the previous salaries of the mother which she     gave to her husband, because they were not a loan which she can ask to be     repaid from the estate.</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    When a person     dies, his wealth passes directly to his heirs straight after his death, and     it is not permissible for anyone to conceal the estate from the heirs or for     anyone to prevent division of the estate. If the heirs agree not to divide     all or some of the inheritance, there is nothing wrong with that. If one of     them wants his share, then he must be given his share of the inheritance,     either by selling property and giving him his share, or by one or all of the     heirs buying his share, so they give him the price of his share of the     inheritance, without any wrongdoing or unfairness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the     answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/4089\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">4089</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What the     father and mother must do is treat their children equally with regard to     giving. It is not permissible for them to favour one of them over another,     even if the one who is favoured is dutiful towards his parents. But they may     show favour to one of the children if there is a legitimate shar’i reason     for doing so, such as if he has a large family and cannot spend on them, or     he is disabled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This has been     discussed in the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/36872\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">36872</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If one of the     parents gave a gift to one of the children and not the others, then they     must take it back and the child must return it and not accept it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From this is     it known that it is not permissible to accept the car which the father     bought for his son. The claim that the son needed the car could have been     dealt with by the father buying a car for his son to drive but not own, so     it would have belonged to the father, then when the father died it would     become part of the estate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So the son has     no choice but to put the car that his father bought for him with the estate,     or to work out its value and keep it, and deduct its value&nbsp; from his share     of the estate, and if the other heirs agree to let him have it, it will     become his.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh     Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said     concerning a similar case:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to     what the brother who asked the question said about the father giving his son     some land … it is not permissible for him to give land to him and not to his     brothers. If we assume that he gave it to him, then he must during his     lifetime give the others something similar to what he gave him, or else take     the land back so that it will be among the property that is inherited after     he dies. If he dies before that, if the children agree to this gift, then it     is valid, just as if they agree to it whilst he is still alive. But if they     do not agree to it, then it should be put back with the estate and inherited     along with the rest of his wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Liqaa’aat     al-Baab il-Maftooh     (39.question no. 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning a case where one of a person’s     sons needed a car:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He may buy a     car for the son to use, but it should remain the property of the father,     because the son only needs to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also     Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (73/question no. 27)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fifthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The parents     must also be fair with regard to the kind of spending that is done for a     reason, if that reason arises again with other children. So if he arranges a     marriage for one of his sons, he must also arrange marriages for his other     children if they need to get married and the parents can afford to get them     married. It is not essential that they spend the same amount on the     weddings. The marriage of one of them may not cost the same as the marriage     of another. So it is not permissible for the parents who have arranged a     marriage for one of their children to give a similar amount of money to the     rest of their children, and after the father dies it is not permissible to     take this money from the estate and give it to the children who did not get     married whilst their father was still alive, unless the other heirs agree to     that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we have     said about marriage applies also to medical treatment, education and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh     Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The basic     principle is that it is not permissible for the father to give anything to     any of his sons or daughters unless he gives something similar to the     others, because Basheer ibn Sa’d al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him)     gave his son al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer a gift, and he came to the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ask him to bear witness to     the gift that he gave to his son. He said to him: “Do you have other sons?”     He said: Yes. He said: “Have you given them a similar gift?” He said: No.     The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fear     Allaah and treat your children fairly.” And he also said: “Let someone else     bear witness to this, for I will not bear witness to injustice.” So it is     not permissible for the father to single out one of his children, whether     sons or daughters, for something unless he gives something similar to the     others, or if they agree to that willingly and by their own choice, and they     are mature and of sound mind. In that case there is nothing wrong with it.     Otherwise, if the gift is to meet some need of maintenance or a need for     marriage, such as if one of them is independent of means and does not need     his father to spend on him, but another is poor and needs his father to     spend on him, and he spends on this poor one as much as is needed, then that     is permissible, even if he does not give anything to the other one who is     independent of means. Similarly, if one of his sons needs to get married and     he arranges his marriage, then he does not have to give the others the same     as he gives to this son for his marriage, but when the others reach the age     of marriage and want to get married, he has to arrange their marriages as he     did for the first one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I would like     to take this opportunity to speak of something that some people do, which is     when a man has children who have reached the age of marriage, he arranges     their marriages, and he has other children who are still small and have not     yet reached the age of marriage. So he leaves a will leaving them after his     death the same amount as he gave to their brothers. This bequest is haraam     and is invalid, because the reason for arranging the marriages of the older     ones was to meet a need, and the younger ones had not yet reached an age     where they needed to get married. If he leaves a will giving them something     like that which he spent to marry off the others, that is haraam and is     invalid, and the will should not be executed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Liqaa’aat     al-Baab il-Mahtooh     (39/question no. 1)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he said     (may Allaah have mercy on him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a man     arranges marriages for his adult sons it is not permissible for him to     bequeath the mahr to his younger sons, but when one of his sons reaches the     age of marriage he must arrange his marriage as he did for the first one.     But if he bequeaths it to him after he dies, this is haraam. The evidence     for that is the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him): “Allaah has given each person his rights and no will can be made     in favour of an heir.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’     Fataawa al-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen     (18/question no. 296).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this,     what the mother says about delaying the division of the estate until the     rest of her children are married and have finished their studies is wrong     and it is not permissible for her to do it or for her children to accept     it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sixthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The children     do not have to make their mother their agent in the disposal of the estate     because she owns nothing but her own share. If they want to appoint her in     charge of their shares, then they may do that. We have stated that it is not     permissible for the mother to take control of the estate or her children’s     shares, rather she must allow it to be divided in accordance with sharee’ah     if the children ask for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for     spending on the children, the mother is not obliged to spend on them unless     they do not have any wealth and she is able to spend on them. But if they     possess wealth then their maintenance should come from their own wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah     knows best.</p>\n",

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“If one of you sees something with his brother that he admires, let him pray for blessing (<em>barakah</em>) for him.” Narrated by Imam Malik in&nbsp;<em>al-Muwatta</em>&nbsp;(2/939), Imam Ahmad in&nbsp;<em>al-Musnad</em>&nbsp;(25/355), and Ibn Majah (3509)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Should_you_repeat_the_dursquoa\">Should you repeat the du’a?</span></h3>\n<p>The scholars differed as to whether this command means that this should be repeated or not.</p>\n<p>According to Usul al-Fiqh, if there is a command to do something with no indication to suggest that it should be done repeatedly, then it does not have to be done repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to the report narrated by Muslim in his&nbsp;<em>Sahih</em>&nbsp;from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressed us and said: “O people, Allah has made Hajj obligatory for you, so do Hajj.” A man said: Is it every year, O Messenger of Allah? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) remained silent until the man said it three times. Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I said yes, it would become obligatory and you would not be able to do it.” Then he said: “Leave me so long as I have left you, for those who came before you were only doomed because of their asking too many questions and differing with their Prophets. If I instruct you to do something, then do as much of it as you can, and if I forbid you to do something, then do not do it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The relevant point in this hadith is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “O people, Allah has made Hajj obligatory for you, so do Hajj.” Similar reports were narrated by Imam Ahmad and an-Nasai. This hadith is quoted as evidence to indicate that a command with nothing to suggest that it should be repeated means that it does not have to be repeated, according to the books of Usul al-Fiqh.” (<em>Adwa al-Bayan, </em>5/74)</p>\n<p>But if there is something to indicate that it should be repeated, then it must be repeated, based on this corroborating evidence. An example of that is if a command to do something is connected to a condition or cause that makes it required to do it. In that case, what is appropriate to the wisdom of the Lawgiver is to repeat the enjoined action every time the reason for which it was prescribed recurs.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Lahham (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“With regard to the Lawgiver, He is most Wise and it is not possible for there to be any contradiction in His commands. Therefore if He prescribes a ruling and gives the reason for it, we know that He has prescribed that ruling to be done every time that reason recurs. And Allah knows best.” <em>(Al-Qawa‘id wa’l-Fawaid al-Usuliyyah, </em>p. 240)</p>\n<p>The hadith quoted above mentions admiration as the reason for praying for barakah; this indicates that the supplication should be repeated every time one sees something that he admires.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_it_a_sin_if_you_donrsquot_say_it\">Is it a sin if you don’t say it?</span></h3>\n<p>As for not praying for barakah, what appears to be the case is that there must be one of two scenarios with regard to the seer (looker):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first scenario: the seer admires it greatly, to the extent that he fears that he could harm his brother with the evil eye. In this case it is obligatory for him to pray for barakah, because the Muslim is required to ward off evil and harm from his brothers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“If the one who is looking fears that he could cause harm by his <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11359\" target=\"_blank\">evil eye</a> to the object that he is looking at, then he may ward off its evil by saying “<em>Allahumma barik ‘alayhi</em>&nbsp;(O Allah, bless it for him),” as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Amir ibn Rabi‘ah, when he looked at Sahl ibn Hunayf: “Did you not pray for barakah for him?” – In other words did you not say &nbsp;“<em>Allahumma barik ‘alayhi</em>&nbsp;(O Allah, bless it for him)”?” (<em>Zad al-Ma‘ad</em>, 4/156)</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah be pleased with him) stated that this is obligatory, when he said:</p>\n<p>“The words of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Did you not pray for barakah for him?”, indicate that the evil eye does not cause any harm if the one who looks at a thing prays for barakah for it; it can only cause harm if he does not offer supplication. So what is required of everyone who admires a thing is to pray for barakah for it. If he prays for barakah, that will inevitably ward off what is feared of harm. And Allah knows best.” (<em>At-Tamhid, </em>6/240-241)</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) followed him in that in&nbsp;<em>at-Tafsir</em>&nbsp;(11/401), and it was quoted from him by Ibn al-Mulaqqin in&nbsp;<em>at-Tawdih</em>&nbsp;(27/401).</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"2\">The second scenario: If he is not known to have an <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20954\" target=\"_blank\">evil eye</a> and he does not fear that he could cause harm, and he is not worried about harming his brother with his <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/89604\" target=\"_blank\">evil eye</a> , then in this case it is still prescribed to pray for barakah, because that is part of showing kindness to his brothers, although we have not come across anyone who says that it is obligatory in such a situation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/299965\" target=\"_blank\">299965</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7747\" target=\"_blank\">7747</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/33663\" target=\"_blank\">33663</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
