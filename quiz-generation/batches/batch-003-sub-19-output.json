Rather, when a woman sees menstrual blood which is dark red, recognizable and has a distinct odor, she should refrain from fasting and praying, on condition that the total number of days of menstrual bleeding does not exceed half of the cycle (i.e., fifteen days in the month). Yellowish and brownish discharges seen after the period has ended are of no significance.",

It is not permissible for the husband to burden his wife with that which she is unable to bear, by combining the burdens of life, working outside the home and bearing children.
