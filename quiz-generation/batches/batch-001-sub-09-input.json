      "title": "Is this hadith authentic: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water”?",
      "question": "<p>How sound is this hadith: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water”? Al-Albani classed it as authentic (hasan).</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>This hadith was narrated by Ibn `Adiyy in <em>Al-Kamil</em> (9/114). He said: Ahmad ibn `Asim al-Balisi told us: Ibrahim ibn Sa`id told us: Yahya ibn Yazid told us, from his father, from Sa`id, from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water.”</p>\n<p>Then he said: This Yahya ibn Yazid ibn `Abd al-Malik has reports other than what I referred to. He is weak, and his father Yazid is weak, and the hadiths that I dictated to you are weak. The status of what I did not dictate is clear and most of it is not known.(<em>Al-Kamil</em>, 9/115).</p>\n<p>Someone other than his son narrated from Yazid ibn `Abd al-Malik, as was noted by al-Bayhaqi in <em>Shu`ab al-Iman</em> (5/67-68): From Dawud ibn `Ata’, from Yazid ibn `Abd al-Malik ibn al-Mughirah an-Nawfali, from his father, from Yazid ibn Khusayfah, and from Yazid ibn Ruman, from Sa`id ibn Abi Sa`id, from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water.”</p>\n<p>This Dawud was classed as da`if by the scholars.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: all the narrators in the isnad of this hadith are weak, hence Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) determined that it is a very weak hadith.</p>\n<p><em>As-Silsilah ad-Da`ifah</em>, 1451.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There are hadiths that are similar in meaning to this hadith.</p>\n<p>It was narrated by Abu Ya`la al-Mawsili in <em>Al-Musnad</em> (5/77), Ibn Abi Hatim in <em>At-Tafsir</em> (5/1490) and others from Musa ibn al-Mughirah: Abu Musa as-Saffar told us: I asked Ibn `Abbas – or he was asked –: Which charity is best?</p>\n<p>He said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of charity is water. Have you not heard that when the people of Hell ask the people of Paradise for help, they will say: {Send down to us some of the water or other things that Allah has provided for you} [Al-A`raf 7:50]?”</p>\n<p>This is a weak isnad.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Musa ibn al-Mughirah from Abu Musa as-Saffar.</p>\n<p>He is not known and his shaykh is not known.(<em>Mizan al-I`tidal</em>, 4/224).</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (1679), an-Nasa’i (3665) and Ibn Majah (3684) narrated from Sa`id ibn al-Musayyib, from Sa`d ibn `Ubadah, who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which charity is best?</p>\n<p>He said: “Giving people water to drink.”</p>\n<p>A number of scholars stated that this hadith is weak, because its isnad is interrupted; Sa`id ibn al-Musayyib did not hear from Sa`d ibn `Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>Al-Mundhiri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Its isnad is interrupted according to all scholars.(<em>At-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib</em>&nbsp; 2/42).</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is mursal, because Sa`id was born in the year in which Sa`d died.</p>\n<p>This hadith has another isnad recorded by Abu Dawud and an-Nasa’i via al-Hasan from Sa`d. It is similar to the first isnad and is also interrupted.</p>\n<p>And it has yet another isnad recorded by at-Tabarani from Humayd ibn Abi’s-Sa`bah, from Sa`d ibn `Ubadah; it is also interrupted and is weak.(<em>At-Talkhis al-Habir</em>, 4/1705).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, all these hadiths have weak isnads.</p>\n<p>But Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that even though each of these hadiths is weak on its own, when they are put together, the text gains some strength. Therefore he determined that it is authentic (hasan) because of corroborating evidence, as he noted in <em>Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib</em>, 960, 962.</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the hadith of Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him):</p>\n<p>Its isnad would be authentic (sahih) were it not for the interruption [in the chain of narration] between Sa`id and Sa`d, as noted above, and the interruption between him and al-Hasan – who is al-Hasan al-Basri – because they were not contemporaries either.</p>\n<p>There is a corroborating report to this hadith, namely the hadith of Abu Hurayrah which is narrated in <em>At-Ta`liq ar-Raghib</em> (2/52-53). Thus it is authentic (hasan).(<em>Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud</em>&nbsp; 5/368).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Even though the isnad of this hadith is weak, as noted above, giving people water to drink may sometimes be one of the best acts of charity, because the benefit of acts of charity varies according to the situation. Therefore providing drinking water in places and at times where there is drought and urgent need for water is better than giving high quality clothing, for example, in charity, because the benefit of water in such cases is greater, because it saves lives.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The best charity is that which meets the need of the recipient and is ongoing.</p>\n<p>For example, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best charity is giving water to drink.” This applies in a place where there is little water and a great deal of thirst. However, giving water to drink in a place where there are rivers and streams flowing is not better than giving food at times of need.(<em>Ar-Ruh</em>, p. 415).</p>\n<p>As for giving water on its own in all situations being the best kind of charitable actions, there does not seem to be anything to support that, and we know of no sound basis for such a view.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/227958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">227958</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is Moon Sighting Essential?",
      "question": "<p>Is it essential for the people to sight the new moon of Ramadan?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The majority of scholars are of the view that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/207382\" target=\"_blank\">sighting the new moon of Ramadan</a> on the first night of the month is a communal obligation, and if all the people fail to do it then they are sinning. This is also the Hanafi view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the jurists were of the view that moon sighting is recommended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Majma` Al-Anhar (1/283): “It is a communal obligation for the people to seek the new moon on the evening of the twenty-ninth of Sha`ban or Ramadan, and also of Dhul Qi`dah, and it is obligatory for the ruler to enjoin the people to do that.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyyah (1/197): “It is obligatory for the people to seek the new moon on the twenty-ninth of Sha`ban at the time of sunset, and if they see it they must fast. If it is cloudy then they must complete the month as thirty days.” (See Fath Al-Qadir, 2/313)</p>\n<p>It says in Kashshaf Al-Qina` (2/300): “It is recommended for the people on the night before the thirtieth of Sha`ban to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111873\" target=\"_blank\">sight the new moon of Ramadan</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is recommended to sight the new moon so as to be on the safe side with regard to fasting and so as to avoid disputes. It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the days in Sha`ban more carefully than at any other time, then he would fast when he sighted (the new moon) of Ramadan. “Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni with an authentic Isnad (chain of narration))&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) in a Marfu` report: “Count the days of Sha`ban for the sake of Ramadan.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi (678).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi: “Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They should strive to count its days accurately, and that is by means of watching the waxing and waning of the moon, so that they will be certain&nbsp; of when to expect the new moon of Ramadan and will not miss any of it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (22/23) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1584\" target=\"_blank\">Sighting the new moon</a> is something that is decreed by the fact that some acts of worship are connected to specific times. It is prescribed for the Muslims to strive in seeking it and it is more important on the night before the thirtieth of Sha`ban, in order to find out whether Ramadan has begun, and on the night before the thirtieth of Ramadan in order to find out whether the month has ended and Shawwal has begun, and on the night before the thirtieth of Dhu’l-Qa’dah to find out if Dhu’l-Hijjah has begun. These three months have to do with two of the pillars of Islam, namely fasting and Hajj, and the setting of the dates for `Eid Al-Fitr and `Eid Al-Adhha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged seeking the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/110350\" target=\"_blank\">sighting of the moon</a> . It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it and break the fast when you see it, and if it is too cloudy then complete the number (of days) of Sha`ban as thirty.” And it was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The month is twenty-nine days, so do not fast until you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month as thirty days.” The first Hadith enjoins fasting the month of Ramadan when its new moon is sighted or when the month of Sha`ban is completed with thirty days, and it enjoins ending the fast when the new moon of Shawwal is sighted, or when Ramadan is completed with thirty days. The second Hadith forbids fasting Ramadan before the new moon is sighted or before Sha`ban has been completed if it is cloudy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And there is a Hadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he enjoined paying attention to the new moon of Sha`ban because of Ramadan. He said: “Count the days of Sha`ban carefully for the sake of Ramadan.” This Hadith shows the importance of paying attention to the month of Sha`ban in order to work out when Ramadan starts. It was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the days in Sha`ban more carefully than at any other time, then he would fast when he sighted (the new moon) of Ramadan, and if it was cloudy he would count thirty days and then fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The commentators said: i.e., he would make sure to count the days of Sha`ban carefully in order to begin the fast of Ramadan at the right time. During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and after he died, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were concerned with sighting the new moon of Ramadan and they used to look for it. It was narrated that `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people sighted the new moon and I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that, and he fasted and told the people to fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with `Umar between Makkah and Madinah and we looked for the new moon. I was a man who had keen eyesight and I sighted it, but no one else claimed that he had seen it except me. I started saying to `Umar: Do you not see it? And he could not see it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hanafis regard sighting the new moon of Ramadan on the night before the thirtieth of Sha`ban as a communal obligation, and if they sight it they should fast, otherwise they should complete the month (as thirty days) and then fast, because that which is essential to performance of an obligatory duty is also obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hanbalis say that it is recommended to sight the new moons so as to be on the safe side with regard to fasting and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50487\" target=\"_blank\">so as to avoid disputes</a> . We did not find any clear view from the Malikis and Shafi`is on this issue.”</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Are all the Muslims sinning if none of them sights the new moon at the beginning or end of Ramadan?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/106492\" target=\"_blank\">Sighting the new moon of Ramadan</a> or Shawwal is something that was established at the time of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), because Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people looked for the new moon and I told the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that I had seen it, so he fasted and told the people to fast. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the way of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) is the best and most complete guidance.” (48 Su’alan fis-Sawm, no. 21)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So it seems that sighting the new moon of Ramadan, Shawwal and Dhul-Hijjah is a communal obligation, because it is connected to two of the pillars of Islam: fasting and Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "When will help and victory from Allah come?",
      "question": "<p>When will help and victory from Allah come? What are the means of attaining it?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah’s help to the Muslims against their disbelieving enemies who wage war on them is something real and true. Allah, may He be exalted, has promised that to the believers, and has told them that it is near, and that He only delays it for certain significant reasons. The one who has strong faith and true certainty will realise that it is indeed near as the Lord, may He be exalted, has told us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’ Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:214].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What this means is: Or do you think that you, O believers in Allah and His Messenger, will enter Paradise without anything befalling you like that which befell those who came before you among the followers of the Prophets and Messengers, of hardship, trials and tests? You will be tested as they were tested, with “severe poverty”, which is severe hardship and want, and “ailments”, which is pain and sickness. But you have not yet been shaken as they were shaken, i.e., you have not yet suffered extreme fear and terror at the hands of your enemy, so that you think that the help of Allah is slow in coming and you say “When will Allah help us?” Then Allah told them that His help was near to them, and that He would cause them to prevail over the enemy and defeat them. Then He fulfilled what He had promised them, and made their word supreme, and extinguished the flames of war lit by those who disbelieved.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tafseer at-Tabari (4/288)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned some of the lessons that we learn from this verse. They include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.The individual should not ask for help except from the One Who is able to give it, namely Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): “‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’”</p>\n<p>2.The methodology of those who believe in the Messengers is the same as the methodology of the Messengers, and they say what they say, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: “even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’” So they say the same thing, seeking to expedite divine help.</p>\n<p>3.The perfect nature of the power of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because He says: “Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!”</p>\n<p>4.The wisdom of Allah, as He withholds help for a certain period of time, even though it is near.</p>\n<p>5.Patience at the time of calamity for the sake of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is one of the means of entering Paradise, because what the verse means is: Have patience so that you may enter Paradise.</p>\n<p>6.The believers are given the glad tidings of victory so as to strengthen their morale, so that they will continue in jihad, hoping for the divine help that they were told about.</p>\n<p>End quote&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah (3/42)</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The help of Allah that is near is not for everyone who claims to believe or claims to be a Muslim; rather it is only for those who truly believe in their hearts and carry out their duties as enjoined by Islam.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).</p>\n<p>And perform As-Salat (Iqamat as-Salat), and give Zakat and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) that you may receive mercy (from Allah)”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:55, 56].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a promise from Allah to His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that He will cause his ummah to gain authority in the land, i.e., become leaders of people and rulers over them, and by means of them the people’s affairs will be put right and the people will submit to their rule, and after having being afraid of the people, they will enjoy security and will rule over them. And He, may He be glorified and exalted, did indeed do that, may He be praised. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pass away until Allah enabled him to conquer Makkah, Khaybar, Bahrain, the entire Arabian Peninsula and all of the land of Yemen; he took the jizyah from the Magians of Hajar and from some of the border regions of greater Syria. Heraclius, the ruler of Byzantium, exchanged gifts with him, as did the ruler of Egypt and Alexandria, al-Muqawqis, the kings of Oman, and the Negus, the ruler of Abyssinia, who came to the throne after Ashamah, may Allah have mercy on him and honour him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away, and Allah chose for him that which is with Him of honour, Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq became the ruler (caliph) of the Muslims. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer (6/77)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This is one of the true promises of Allah, that was proven to be true and was fulfilled. He promised those among this ummah who adhered to faith and did righteous deeds that He would grant them succession to the present rulers in the earth, and they would have control of it and be in charge of its affairs, and that He would grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them, namely the religion of Islam, which is superior to all other religions. He has chosen it for this ummah, because of its virtue and honour, by enabling this ummah to establish His religion and to adhere to all its teachings and instructions, both apparent and hidden, and to apply them to themselves and to others, because others – namely the followers of other religions and all disbelievers – are subjugated and defeated. And He has promised that He will give them in exchange a safe security after their fear, as one of them could not practice his religion openly and follow what he believed in except by exposing himself to the harm of the disbelievers. Moreover, the Muslims were very few in number compared to others, and the people of the earth had united against them and were plotting and scheming against them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah made these promises to them at the time when this verse was revealed, at which time they had not had the experience of having power or gaining control of the land, or being able to establish the Islamic religion and enjoy complete security, so that they could worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, and not fear anybody except Allah. The first generation of this ummah attained that level of faith and righteous deeds in such a way that they became superior to others and as a result of that Allah enabled them to subjugate lands and peoples, and they were able to conquer vast lands in the east and in the west, and they enjoyed&nbsp; complete security and control in the land. This is one of the dazzling and amazing signs of Allah. And this is still the case and will remain so until the Hour begins: every time the Muslims achieve a high level of faith and righteous deeds, the promise of Allah will inevitably be fulfilled; the disbelievers and hypocrites are only given power over the Muslims, and sometimes defeat them, because of the degree of shortcomings among the Muslims with regard to their level of faith and righteous deeds. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer as-Sa‘di (p. 573).</p>\n<p>See also: Adwa’ al-Bayaan by ash-Shinqeeti (6/36); Fath al-Qadeer by ash-Shawkaani (4/69)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the people are sincere in their belief in their Lord and their establishing His laws, that is indicative of how they will be when Allah, may He be exalted, gives them power in the land. These are the ones to whom Allah, may He be exalted, has promised His help and support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order for Iqamat-as-Salat. (i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salat (prayers) (the males in mosques)), to pay the Zakat and they enjoin Al-Maroof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) (i.e. they make the Quran as the law of their country in all the spheres of life). And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures)”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:41].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting verses which mention the help of Allah, may He be exalted, to the believers:</p>\n<p>The words “Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land” [al-Hajj 22:41] indicate that there is no promise of help from Allah unless the believers establish prayer, give zakaah, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. If Allah gives power in the land to some people, and grants them authority, yet despite that they do not establish prayer or give zakaah or enjoin what is right or forbid what is wrong, then they have no promise of help from Allah, because they are not counted as belonging to His party or as being among His close friends to whom He has promised His help. Rather they are the party and close friends of the Shaytaan. If they seek help from Allah based on the fact that He has promised it to them, then their likeness is that of a hired worker who refuses to do the work for which he was hired, then demands his wages. The one who is like that is not rational at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says [in the preceding verse]: “Truly, Allah is Most Strong, All-Mighty” [al-Hajj 22:40]. The “Most Strong” is the one who overwhelms and is not overwhelmed by anything, as we have stated above several times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These verses are indicative of the validity of the caliphate of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs: Allah helped them against their enemies because they supported His religion, and they established prayer, gave zakaah, enjoined what is right and forbade what is wrong. So Allah gave them power and caused them to succeed the former rulers in the land, as He says:</p>\n<p>“Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:55].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The truth is that the verses mentioned above include the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as well as those who support the religion of Allah in the most perfect manner. And Allah knows best. End quote.</p>\n<p>Adwa’ al-Bayaan (5/272)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, it must be understood that there are means of attaining divine help; whoever wants divine help without taking these measures is acting in a manner contrary to Islamic teaching and common sense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Sa‘eed ibn ‘Ali ibn Wahb al-Qahtaani (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>It is known for certain that there are means of attaining divine help for the Muslims against our enemies, by Allah’s leave. These means include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.Faith and righteous deeds&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:55].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.Supporting the religion of Allah, may He be exalted&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the greatest means of attaining divine help is supporting the religion of Allah, may He be exalted, and adhering to it in word, belief and deed, and calling others to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.</p>\n<p>But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain”</p>\n<p>[Muhammad 47:7, 8].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.Putting one’s trust in Allah whilst taking appropriate measures</p>\n<p>Putting one’s trust in Allah whilst making ready one’s resources is one of the greatest factors in victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah, certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)”</p>\n<p>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:159].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an essential part of putting one’s trust in Allah to take appropriate measures, because putting one’s trust in Him is based on two important foundations:</p>\n<p>(i)depending on Allah and trusting in His promise and help</p>\n<p>(ii)taking appropriate measures as prescribed in Islam. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery, etc.) to threaten the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others besides whom, you may not know but whom Allah does know. And whatever you shall spend in the Cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you, and you shall not be treated unjustly”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:60].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.Mutual consultation among those in authority to mobilise and prepare the Muslim armies&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to consult his companions, despite the fact that his reasoning was perfect and his opinion was sound, in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted, and so as to make his companions feel included in the decision-making process. Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“and who (conduct) their affairs by mutual consultation”</p>\n<p>[ash-Shoora 42:38].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.Standing firm when meeting the enemy in battle&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the factors of divine help is standing firm when meeting the enemy in battle, and not fleeing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, do not wish to meet the enemy, and ask Allah to keep you safe and sound, but if you do meet them, then be patient and steadfast, and know that Paradise lies in the shade of the swords.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6.Courage, heroism and self-sacrifice&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among the greatest means of attaining divine help is acquiring the characteristics of courage and self-sacrifice, and believing that jihad neither brings forward nor puts back the time of death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisa’ 4:78].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7.Du ‘aa’ (supplication) and remembering Allah (dhikr) a great deal&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among the greatest and most powerful factors of victory is seeking the help of Allah and remembering Him a great deal, because He is the Most Strong Who is able to defeat His enemies and grant victory to His close friends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad SAW) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:186].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8.Obedience to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obedience to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the greatest factors of victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (SAW), fears Allah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful ones”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:52].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.Being united and not differing&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mujaahideen must fulfil the factors of attaining divine help and victory, especially relying on Allah and helping one another, and avoiding disputes and division.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not dispute (with one another) lest you lose courage and your strength depart, and be patient. Surely, Allah is with those who are As-Saabirin (the patient ones, etc.)”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:46].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp;Patience and steadfastness&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is essential to be patient in all our affairs, and especially to be patient when fighting the enemies of Allah and His Messenger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allah, so that you may be successful”</p>\n<p>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:200].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>11.&nbsp;Sincerity to Allah alone, may He be exalted&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fighter or warrior cannot be a mujaahid striving for the sake of Allah unless his intention is sincerely and purely for the sake of Allah alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And be not like those who come out of their homes boastfully and to be seen of men”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:47].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>12.&nbsp;Longing for that which is with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the things that helps to bring victory against the enemies is longing for the bounty and grace of Allah and for happiness in this world and in the hereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>13.&nbsp;Appointing people of faith as leaders&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another of the means of attaining divine help and victory is giving positions of leadership in the army, military campaigns, regiments and battle fronts to those who are known for their complete faith and righteous deeds, then the next best, then the next best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa (i.e. one of the Muttaqoon (pious)). Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware”</p>\n<p>[al-Hujuraat 49:13].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>14.&nbsp;Seeking protection by adhering to guidelines that save us from doom, defeat and punishment&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These guidelines may be summed up as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Repenting and seeking forgiveness for all acts of disobedience and sin, both major and minor. Repentance cannot be accepted unless it fulfils the following conditions:</p>\n<p>·giving up and refraining from all sins</p>\n<p>·resolving not to go back to them</p>\n<p>·regretting what one has done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the sin has to do with the rights of another person, then there is a fourth condition, which is to seek forgiveness from the person who was affected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Fearing Allah, may He be exalted. This means that a person makes his fear of Allah’s wrath, anger and punishment a barrier that will protect him from that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Doing all obligatory duties and following them up with naafil (supererogatory) actions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>Following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in all beliefs, words and deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sixthly:</p>\n<p>Du‘aa’ (supplication) and beseeching Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Jihad fi Sabeel-Allah: Fadluhu wa Maraatibuhu wa Asbaab an-Nasr ‘ala al-A‘da’, by Shaykh Sa‘eed ibn ‘Ali ibn Wahb al-Qahtaani (p. 21-30_&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn, etc), and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [Al-Maidah 5:90]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_hadith_says_about_prohibition_of_alcohol\">What hadith says about prohibition of alcohol?</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allah has cursed the drinker of alcohol. In Sunan Abi Dawud (3189) it is narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9411\" target=\"_blank\">the one who buys it</a> , the one squeezes (the grapes, etc), the one for whom it is squeezed, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96739\" target=\"_blank\">the one who carries it</a> and the one to whom it is carried.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani as stated in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/700.)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the one who is addicted to alcohol to one who worships idols.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is addicted to alcohol is like one who worships an idol.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3375; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2720)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The one who is addicted to alcohol will be denied admission to Paradise. It was narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who is addicted to alcohol will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3376; classed as sahih by al-Albani as stated in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2721)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>It was narrated that ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Avoid alcohol for it is the mother of all evils. There was a man among the people who came before you who was a devoted worshipper. A seductive woman fell in love with him, and she sent her slave-woman to him to call him to bear witness. He went with the slave-woman, and every time they passed through a door, she locked it behind them, until he reached a beautiful woman with whom was a child and a vessel of wine. She said, ‘I did not call you to bear witness, rather I called you either to have intercourse with me, or to drink a cup of this wine, or to kill this child.’ He said, ‘Pour me some of this wine.’ So she poured him a cup, then he said, ‘Give me more,’ and he did not stop until he had intercourse with her and killed the child. So avoid alcohol, for by Allah faith and addiction to wine cannot be combined except soon one of them will be expelled.”&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Nasai, 5666; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai, 5236)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27143\" target=\"_blank\">His prayers will not be accepted for forty days</a> . It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever drinks alcohol and gets drunk, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he drinks wine again and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he drinks wine again and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does that again, Allah will give him to drink of the mud of khabal on the Day of Resurrection.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is the mud of khabal?” He said, “The juice of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3377; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2722)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fact that his prayers are not accepted does not mean that the person’s prayers are invalid, or that he should give up prayer. Rather what it means is that he will not be rewarded for them. So the purpose of his prayer is to fulfil his duty and to avoid the punishment for not praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mandah said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The phrase “his prayers will not be accepted” means that he will not be rewarded for his prayers for forty days, as a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20037\" target=\"_blank\">punishment for drinking alcohol</a> . This is like what they said about the one who speaks when the imam is delivering the khutbah on Friday: he prays Jumu’ah [Friday prayer] but there is no Jumu’ah for him, meaning that he will not be given the reward for praying Jumu`ah, as a punishment for his sin.” (Ta’zim Qadr al-Salah, 2/587, 588)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to his prayer not being accepted, what this means is that he will not be rewarded for it, even though it is valid, and he does not have to repeat it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what the questioner was told about her fasting not being accepted, this is based on the view of some of the scholars that the mention of prayer in the hadith quoted above is a warning that no other acts of worship will be accepted either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is said that prayer was singled out for mention because it is the best physical act of worship, and if it is not accepted, it is more likely that other acts of worship will not be accepted either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-‘Iraqi and al-Manawi also said something similar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this view, fasting is not accepted either, but this does not mean that the person who drank alcohol should not fast, rather he is enjoined to fast, but it will not be accepted from him, as a rebuke.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the person who drinks alcohol should still offer the prayers on time, and fast in Ramadan. If he omits some of his prayer or fasting, he will be committing a major sin that is even greater than the sin of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/41760\" target=\"_blank\">drinking alcohol</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that if a Muslim commits sin and is unable to repent because of his weakness of faith, that should not be used to justify his persisting in sin or his addiction, or his neglecting to do acts of worship. Rather he has to do whatever he can of acts of worship and strive to give up the sins that he is committing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim has to fear Allah and beware of the wiles and snares of the Shaytan [Satan]. He should not let his soul become a plaything of the Shaytan. If his Shaytan overpowers him and makes him fall into sin and disobedience towards his Creator, then he must hasten to repent, for “the one who repents is like the one who did not sin.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2450; classed as sahih by al-Busayri as stated in al-Zawaid Hashiyat Sunan Ibn Majah)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This punishment for the one who drinks alcohol applies to the one who does not repent. As for the one who repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance and accept his good deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to protect us from the tricks of the Shaytan and to help us avoid temptations both obvious and hidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Does the judge have the right to rule that the father may visit his children on only one day of the week? Is one day sufficient to satisfy the father’s longing to see his children? Is this verdict based on the Sunnah of the Prophet or a command of Allah, may He be exalted?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The father has the right to visit his child who is in his mother’s custody, according to scholarly consensus.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em> (17/317):</p>\n<p>Both parents of the child who is in custody, if they have separated, have the right to see him and visit him. This is a matter concerning which there is consensus among the jurists, but they differ with regard to some of the details. End quote.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’</em> (21/205):</p>\n<p>If the wife has left the marital home or the spouses are separated by divorce, for example, and they have one or more children together, then according to Islamic teachings it is not permissible for one of them to prevent the other from seeing and visiting their child. If their child is in the mother’s custody, for example, it is not permissible for her to prevent his father from seeing him and visiting him, because Allah, may He be glorified, has enjoined upholding ties of kinship, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{ Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives …}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:36].</p>\n<p>And according to the hadith: “Whoever separates a mother and her child, Allah will separate him from his loved ones on the Day of Resurrection.”</p>\n<p>Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’</p>\n<p>Bakr Abu Zayd, Salih al-Fawzan, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah Al ash-Shaykh. End quote.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is no specific text from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to defining the duration of visits to see the child. Rather it is a matter to be worked out by jurists. For more information, please see: <em>al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em> (17/317-318).</p>\n<p>From these different views, it seems that the scholars pay attention to the following when working out times for seeing the child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The best interests of the child in question</li>\n<li>Visits should be on a reasonable basis, so that the parent who has custody will not be harmed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore each case should be worked out on its own merits, according to the best interests of the child, the circumstances of the parent who has custody, and the circumstances of the parent who is asking to visit the child, in order to put an end to disputes that often occur between the parents because of these visits.</p>\n<p>If the shar‘i court decides on a time and duration for visits, then they must have worked it out on the basis of what is thought most likely to serve everybody’s interests. If the father thinks that the time allocated is unfair, then he must lodge an appeal so that his case may be re-examined.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

If we assume that you get up late and you need to urinate, there is no sin on you if you urinate and wait for it to stop, even if     you miss the prayer in congregation, because in this case you are excused, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “There is no prayer when food is ready or when a person needs to relieve himself (of either urine or stools).” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 560).     Based on this, we say: Allow enough time before the time of prayer to let the urine stop, but if you cannot manage that then you should wait, even     if you miss the prayer in congregation, if you are desperate and cannot focus on anything else. And Allaah is the Source of strength,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawa Manaar al-Islam, 1/106.</p>\n",

      "title": "The story of Abu Mihjan (may Allaah be pleased with him)",
      "question": "<p>I heard one of the shaykhs speaking about enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and saying that it is obligatory upon every Muslim, even the one who has fallen into sin, to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. He said that it is not essential for the person who does this to be of sound character, as is well known from the story of Abu Mihjan. My question is, who was Abu Mihjan and what was his story?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>I congratulate you on your keenness to learn     and I ask Allaah to bless us and you with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Mihjan was one of the companions of the     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (may Allaah be pleased with them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Sahaabi was suffering from an addiction     to drinking wine. He was brought and flogged, then brought and flogged again, but he knew that this problem did not relieve him of his duty to     strive for the cause of Islam. So he went out with the Muslims to al-Qaadisiyyah as a soldier, seeking martyrdom on the battlefield. In     al-Qaadisiyyah he was brought to the commander of the army, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas, for having drunk wine. Sa’d detained him so that the Muslims     ranks would be cleansed of such a person. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This detention was a harsh punishment which     caused Abu Mihjan a great deal of anguish. When he heard the sounds of swords and spears, and the neighing of the horses, and he knew that the     jihad had begun, and the gates of Paradise were open, he was filled with longing for jihad.&nbsp; He called to the wife of Sa’d ibn Abi Waaqqas saying,     “Let me go and I promise Allaah that if I come back safe and sound, I will put my own feet in the chains, and if I am killed, then you will be rid     of me.” She felt sorry for him, so she let him go, and he leapt onto a horse belonging to Sa’d which was called al-Balqa’. Then he picked up a     spear and set off. He did not attack any group of enemy soldier but he scattered them. Sa’d was supervising the battle and he was surprised and     said, “This is the running of al-Balqa’, and the style of attack is that of Abu Mihjan, but Abu Mihjan is in chains.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the battle was over, Abu Mihjan went     back and put his feet in the chains. The wife of Sa’d told him this wonderful story, so Sa’d admired this man and his care for Islam and his     longing for jihad, so he himself went to this wine-drinker, released the chains with his own hands and said, “Get up, for by Allaah I will never     flog you for drinking wine again.” Abu Mihjan said, “By Allaah, I will never drink it again.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Isaabah fi Tamyeez al-Sahaabah,     4/173-174; al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, 9/632-633</p>\n",

      "title": "Her period became irregular because of taking pills to prevent menstruation; what should she do about prayer and fasting?",
      "question": "<p>A few years ago, a few months after I reached puberty, my family decided to go for Hajj. My period began a few days before the date of travel, so my mother and I were asked to take pills to stop our menses, and I did that. Since that time, my period has not been regular, to the extent that it does not come for several months, and sometimes when it starts it does not stop. My period began ten or eleven days before Ramadan this year, then I did ghusl after approximately nine days, then I noticed that it began again after two days. My grandmother told me not to fast at the beginning of Ramadan, and I did not fast the first two days of the month, then I did ghusl and fasted on the third day, even though the bleeding was still ongoing. That is because I think I read a hadith in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed a woman to pray after wrapping herself in cotton or heavy cloth, because it was not menstrual bleeding. I hope you can explain to me clearly what I should do.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The way to know whether a woman has become pure from menses is through one of two signs: emission of the white discharge, or dryness and complete cessation of bleeding. In that case she should pray and fast, then if the bleeding resumes, it comes under the rulings on menses, and she is not regarded as mustahaadah [experiencing non-menstrual bleeding) unless the bleeding is continuous, or it only stops briefly. This is according to a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (p. 275).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Based on that, you have to make up the days that you fasted whilst you were bleeding, if the bleeding did not continue for the rest of the month.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If the bleeding did continue without ceasing, then you are mustahaadah, and in the next month you should do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You should stop praying and fasting for the duration of your former regular period, then do ghusl and pray. Istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding] does not prevent a woman from praying and fasting, but she must protect herself by wrapping herself with cotton or heavy cloth to prevent the blood from spreading and contaminating her clothing or the place where she is praying.</li>\n<li>If she did not previously have a regular cycle, then she should learn how to distinguish between different types of bleeding, because menstrual blood is dark and thick, has an unpleasant odour, and is usually accompanied by pain (cramps), whereas the bleeding of istihaadah is lighter in colour and is thin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So menses is the days when the blood is dark and thick; as for the other type of bleeding, it is istihaadah.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If there is no difference in the type of blood, then she should stop praying for six or seven days, because that is the usual length of menses for women, then she should do ghusl and pray.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The woman who is mustahaadah should do wudu (ablution) for every obligatory prayer after the time for it has begun, and she may offer whatever naafil (supererogatory) prayers she wishes with that wudoo’.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/68818\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">68818</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Her husband spends his wealth on haraam things; can she take some of it without his knowledge to save it for the children?",
      "question": "<p>I have been married for ten years and I have two children. After five years of marriage, my husband began to reject me, but for the sake of the children I put up with it in the hope that he might come back to me. But I have found out that he is interested in other women. I gave up my job and travelled with him, and I did not tell anyone among our family. I tried to convince him to marry another wife and treat me in a manner that is pleasing to Allah, but he refused. I stayed with him for the sake of our children. Please note that he is a brilliant father and does not mistreat me, but I noticed that he spends a great deal of money on these girls. Is it permissible for me to take some of his money without his knowledge, to keep it for his children?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If your husband is spending on you and on his children, then it is not permissible for you to take any of his money, because it is haraam to take money except with the consent of its owner. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisa’ 4:29].</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to one another, as sacred as this day of yours in this month of yours in this land of yours. Let those who are present convey it to those who are absent.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (67) and Muslim (1679).</p>\n<p>And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the wealth of a Muslim unless he gives it willingly.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1459).</p>\n<p>If he falls short in obligatory spending, it is permissible for you to take that from his wealth on a reasonable basis, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) according to which Hind bint ‘Utbah said: O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man and he does not give me what is sufficient for me and my children, except what I take from him without him knowing. He said: “Take what is sufficient for you and your child on a reasonable basis.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5364).</p>\n<p>But if he is not falling short in obligatory spending, then it is not permissible for you to take anything of his wealth without his consent.</p>\n<p>So beware of taking from his wealth that which is not permissible for you, or of hiding anything of it, even if that is on the grounds of saving it for his children, because you have no authority to do that and the children have no right to their father’s wealth whilst he is still alive, apart from what is needed for their maintenance, unless your husband gives you permission to save (some of his money), in which case there is nothing wrong with doing so.</p>\n<p>So if you tell him that you are going to save any surplus from household costs for the children, for example, and he gives permission to do that, then there is nothing wrong with it, and it will come under the heading of a conditional gift to be given when one has the means to do so.</p>\n<p>You should also advise your husband to fear Allah, may He be exalted, to remember that He is always watching, and to take care of his wealth.</p>\n<p>You should also be wise in calling him to goodness and diverting him from evil; you should be patient and seek reward with Allah, and focus on raising your children. You should be patient in bearing what you dislike of his conduct, for that is better for you than destroying the household and causing hardship to the children.</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Know that there is a great deal of good in patiently bearing what is disliked, victory comes with patience and relief comes with distress and with hardship comes ease” Narrated by Ahmad (2803) and others, from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir and the commentators on al-Musnad.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answer to question no. 154172, in which we described some wise methods that the wife may follow in calling her husband.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide your husband and put your mind at rest.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
