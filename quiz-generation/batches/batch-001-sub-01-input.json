      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on kissing the cover of the Ka’bah, the Black Stone and the Mus-haf?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Kissing any place on earth is bid’ah (an innovation), apart from the Black Stone. Were it not that this is following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), kissing the Black Stone would be bid’ah too. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say: “I know that you are only a stone and can neither cause harm nor bring benefit. Were it not for the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed you, I would not have kissed you.” Hence it is not permissible to kiss the covers of the Ka’bah or its stones, or the Yemeni Corner, or the Mus-haf, or to touch them with the intent of seeking blessing from them .&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "The Jews’ attempts to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)",
      "question": "<p>I have heard the following: that the Jews tried to kill the Messenger 3 times. And the last time was 6 years before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, with poisoned mutton, of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate two mouthfuls, then Allaah caused the sheep to speak and tell the Messenger that it was poisoned. When the Messenger died, he said that it was as if he could taste that mutton. Is this true? If it is true, then it means that we have a great score to settle with them.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Jews wanted to kill the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) on several occasions, including the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – When he was a child. Ibn Sa’d narrated in al-Tabaqaat, with an isnaad going     back to Ishaaq ibn ‘Abd-Allaah that when the mother of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him to the Sa’di woman     who breastfed him, she said to her, “Keep him safe,” and she told her what she had seen. Haleemah al-Sa’diyyah passed by some Jews and said, “Will     you not tell me about this son of mine? I conceived him in such and such a manner, and I gave birth to him in such and such a manner, and I saw     such and such,” and she repeated what his mother had told her. They said to one another, “Kill him!” They asked her, “Is he an orphan?” She said,     “No, this is his father and I am his mother.” They said, “If he had been an orphan we would have killed him.” Haleemah (his wet nurse) took him     and said, “I nearly lost that which had been entrusted to me.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This report is mursal, but the men of its isnaad are thiqaat (trustworthy).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – They tried to kill him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after     Badr. Banu al-Nadeer sent for him to come out to them with thirty of his companions, and said “We will send out thirty of our rabbis, to meet in     such and such a place, halfway between us and you, so that they can listen to you. If they believe in you then we will all believe in you.” Then     they said: “How can we reach an understanding when there are sixty of us? Send out three of your companions and we will send out three of our     scholars to listen to you. They were carrying concealed daggers and they wanted to kill the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him). A sincere woman from among Banu al-Nadeer sent word to her nephew (her brother’s son) who was a Muslim man from among the     Ansaar, and told him about that, and he told the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) went back, and the following day he brought his troops and besieged them, and the Jews of Banu al-Nadeer were expelled.     This story was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his Musannaf, and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (3004), via ‘Abd al-Razzaaq, but he does     not mention the details of the story, rather he says, “… ‘They will listen to you and if they believe in you, we shall believe in you.’ The     narrator then narrated the whole story. When the next day came, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out     in the morning with an army, and besieged them.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Ibn Ishaaq mentions another reason for the expulsion of Banu al-Nadeer, which is that the     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to Banu al-Nadeer to ask them for help in paying the diyah of two men of ahl     al-dhimmah who had been killed by mistake by ‘Amr ibn Umayyah al-Dumari. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat by a     wall belonging to Banu al-Nadeer, and they plotted to throw a rock on him and kill him. The Revelation informed him of that and he rushed back to     Madeenah, then he issued orders that they should be besieged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – Then came the poisoning incident, after the conquest of Khaybar. Al-Bukhaari     (2617) and Muslim (2190) narrated from Anas that a Jewish woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     with some poisoned mutton. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate from it, then he asked her about that. She     said, “I wanted to kill you.” He said, “Allaah would not let you do that.” They said, “Shall we kill her?” He said, “No.” He said, I can still see     the effect of that on the palate of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said: It is as if the poison still left some trace of blackness etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The name of this woman was Zaynab bint al-Haarith, the wife of Salaam ibn Mashkam,     one of the leaders of the Jews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reports differ as to whether or not she was killed. It seems that the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not kill her at first, but when Bishr ibn al-Bara’ ibn Ma’roor died as a result of the     effects of this food, then he executed her as a qisaas punishment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Al-Bukhaari (5777) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said:&nbsp; When Khaybar was conquered,     a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) said, “Let all the Jews who have been here, be assembled before me.” The Jews were gathered and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something?” They replied, “Yes.” He asked, “Have you     poisoned this sheep?” They said, “Yes.” He asked, “What made you do that?” They said, “We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would     have got rid of you, and if you are a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to feel ill     because of this food, and he would be treated with cupping for that. </p>\n<p>Ahmad (2784) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a Jewish woman sent a gift to the     Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of a poisoned roasted sheep. He sent for her and asked her, “What made you do     what you did?” She said, “I wanted to see if you were a Prophet, then Allaah would tell you about it, and if you were not a Prophet the people     would be rid of you.” Whenever the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) felt ill as a result of that he would have     himself treated by cupping. On one occasion he traveled and when he entered ihraam he felt ill as a result of that and he had himself treated by     cupping. The editor of al-Musnad classed it as saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That had an impact in causing his death, so he  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) died as a martyr (shaheed), as Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If I were to swear by Allaah nine times that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was killed, that is more beloved to me than swearing once, because Allaah made him a Prophet and made him a     martyr.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3617. The editors said, its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sindi said: The words “he was killed” mean by the poison in the meat of the     sheep’s foreleg that he ate, when the effects of that appeared when he was dying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Quoted from Haashiyat al-Musnad, 6/116.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh, in a mu’allaq report, and al-Haakim     narrated in his Mustadrak in a mawsool report, that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) used to say, in the illness which would be his last, ‘O ‘Aa’ishah, I still feel the pain of the food that I ate in Khaybar,     and this time I feel that my aorta is being cut from that poison.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aorta is the vein that is towards the back and is connected to the heart; if     it is cut then the person will die.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The conquest of Khaybar took place in Muharram or Rabee’ al-Awwal of the year 7     AH. So this event took place four years before the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is in addition to the recorded crimes of the Jews which know no limit in     ancient or modern times. The enmity between us and them will last until we fight them and kill them at the end of time, as the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Yahood fi’l-Sunnah al-Mutahharah, by Dr. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Naasir     al-Shaqaari; Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/279&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Charity given during one's lifetime is better",
      "question": "<p>Is it better for a person to give charity when he is alive, or can he write in his will that it is to be given after he dies?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The virtue of giving in charity whilst one is in good health:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, which charity brings a greater reward?” He said, “If you give in charity when you are healthy and miserly, fearing poverty and hoping for richness. Do not delay until you are at the point of death and you say, ‘Give this to So and so, give this to So and so,’ …” (al-Bukhaari, 1330; Muslim, 1713).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Al-Khattaabi said: what this hadeeth means is that miserliness is more likely when one is in good health, so if a person is miserly but he still gives in charity, his intention is more sincere and his reward will be greater, unlike the one who is facing death and no longer has any hope of living. Then he starts to realize that someone else will take his wealth, so his charity in this case is lacking, when compared with charity given when one is in good health. Stinginess is based on the hope of remaining alive and fear of poverty… so a person does not have as much reward for his will, compared to the reward for charity given by one who is healthy and miserly.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The hadeeth indicates that paying off debts and giving in charity during one's lifetime when one is in good health is better than doing so after death or when one is sick. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to that when he said: ‘When you are in good health and being cautious, hoping to be rich…’ because when a person is in good health it is usually harder for him to give money, because the Shaytaan makes him fear for it and makes attractive to him the idea that he may live a long life and need that money, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty’[al-Baqarah 2:268]</p>\n<p>The Shaytaan may also make attractive the idea of being unfair in one's will or revoking it altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the Salaf said of some wealthy people: “They disobey Allah with regard to their wealth twice, by being stingy with it when it is in their hands – i.e., during their lifetime, and by being extravagant with it when it is no longer in their hands – i.e., after death.” Al-Tirmidhi narrated with a hasan isnaad, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, that Abu’l-Dardaa’ said in a marfoo’ report: “The likeness of the one who frees slaves and gives in charity when he is dying is that of a person who gives his food away after he has eaten his fill.” This is similar to the hadeeth quoted above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood narrated a marfoo’ hadeeth from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, which says: “If a man were to give one dirham in charity when he is alive and in good health, that is better for him than giving one hundred when he is dying.”.</p>\n",

Allah has prescribed two festivals or ‘Eids for us to celebrate, and it is not permissible for us to celebrate any others. (Please see question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/486\" target=\"_blank\">486</a> ).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_it_permissible_to_celebrate_Mawlid_al-Nabi_Prophet_Muhammadrsquos_birthdaynbsp\">Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday)?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to celebrating the day on which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born, it should be noted that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell us to celebrate this day, and he himself (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not celebrate it, nor did his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They loved the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) far more than we do, yet despite that they did not celebrate this day. Hence we do not celebrate this day, in obedience to the command of Allah Who has commanded us to follow the commands of His Prophet. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).”</b> [al-Hashr 59:7]</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: <b>“I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah [way] and the way of the Rightly-Guided khalifas.

      "answer": "<p>The majority of scholars assert that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36793\" target=\"_blank\">witr prayer is a confirmed sunnah</a> that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) practiced consistently, and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith regarding the Bedouin who once came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asking about Islam, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) answered, \"Five prayers within one day-and-night.\" The Bedouin asked, \"Am I obliged to other than those?\" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, \"(not) Unless you volunteer of your own.\" (Agreed upon)</p>\n<p>Some scholars have said that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/279251\" target=\"_blank\">qiyam al-layl</a> (prayer at the heart of night) and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/46544\" target=\"_blank\">witr prayer</a> are the best of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/33779\" target=\"_blank\">voluntary prayers</a> . Therefore, one should consistently practice them and not neglect them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not neglect the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/143240\" target=\"_blank\">prayers during the&nbsp; night</a> nor two rak`ahs before Fajr neither in residence nor in travel as reported in authentic hadiths.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
