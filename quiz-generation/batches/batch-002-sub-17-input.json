      "title": "Does the fact that a disbeliever will be a Muslim’s ransom from the Fire mean that none of the Muslims will ever enter the Fire?",
      "question": "<p>I had a question about a Hadith that I read. I was wondering if someone could explain this in detail. Does this Sahih Hadith mean that no Muslim would go to hell?<br />\nAbu Burda reported on the authority of his father that Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: No Muslim would die but Allah would admit in his stead a Jew or a Christian in Hell-Fire. 'Umar b. Abd al-'Aziz took an oath: By One besides Whom there is no god but He, thrice that his father had narrated that to him from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Muslim (2767) narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will give every Muslim a Jew or a Christian, and He will say: This is your ransom from the Fire.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim also narrated (2767) from Abu Burdah that he told ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, from his father, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No Muslim man dies but Allah causes a Jew or a Christian to enter the Fire in his stead.” ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez asked him to swear by Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, three times that his father narrated that to him from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he swore to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Maajah (4341) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one among you who does not have two abodes: an abode in Paradise and an abode in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise inherit his abode. This is what Allaah says: ‘These are indeed the inheritors’ [al-Mu’minoon 23:10].</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Ransom” means salvation and sacrifice. What this hadeeth means is that which is mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: everyone has an abode in Paradise and an abode in Hell. If the believer enters Paradise, the disbeliever in Hell will take his place, because he deserves that due to his disbelief. What is meant by the words “your ransom from the Fire” is that you were exposed to the risk of entering the Fire, and this is your ransom, because Allah, may He be exalted, decreed a number for it to fill it. Because the disbelievers will enter it because of their disbelief and sin, they will become like ransoms for the Muslims.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (17/85)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because every accountable person has a place in Paradise and a place in Hell, whoever believes truly, his place in Hell will be replaced with a place in Paradise, but for the one who does not believe it will be the opposite, and it will be as if the disbelievers took the places of the believers in Hell. Moreover, because Allah has sworn to fill Hell, it will be filled with the disbelievers so as to save the believers from the Fire. So in that regard they are like a ransom for the believers. Perhaps the reason why the Jews and Christians are singled out for mention is because they are well known for their opposition to the Muslims and for being their opposites with regard to believing in the Messenger, which dictates that they should be saved.</p>\n<p>End quote from Mirqaat al-Mafaateeh (8/3525).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up all of that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the Day of Resurrection there will be a Jew or a Christian for every Muslim, who will be his ransom from the Fire. That does not contradict the fact that some Muslims sinners will enter the Fire for their sins, so that Allah may purify them thereof, because they will enter it, then they will be brought out of it by Allah’s mercy, then they will enter Paradise, where they will inherit what would have been the disbelievers’ places in it, because Allah has forbidden it to the disbelievers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Allah (st) will give every Muslim a Jew or a Christian, and He will say: This is your ransom from the Fire.” Indicate that this bounty will include all the Muslims, with no exceptions, because ransom is salvation, as mentioned above, and salvation will be for every Muslim. That is not contradicted by the fact that he may enter the Fire, because his entering it will be for the purpose of purification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No evil doer or anyone who has a trace of evildoing will enter Paradise. Whoever is purified in this world and meets Allah pure and free of any impurities, will enter it with out ma’ooq. Whoever is not purified in this world, if his impurity is inherent, as in the case of the disbeliever, he will not enter paradise under any circumstances, but if his impurity is acquired because of sin and is transient, he will enter Paradise after having been purified in the Fire from that impurity, then he will be brought out of the Fire.</p>\n<p>Endquote from Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/56)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, it will benefit him someday in his life, no matter what befalls him before that.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu ‘jam al-Awsat (6396); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Targheeb (1525)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147996\">147996</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/138650\"> 138650</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Which is better if one stays up at night: praying or reading Qur’aan?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Praying is better than reading Qur’aan outside of prayer. This was stated by the imams. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Adhere to righteousness even though you will not able to do all acts of virtue. Know that the best of your deeds is prayer and that no one maintains his wudoo’ except a believer.” But if a person feels more focused and ponders and understands better when he reads Qur’aan outside of prayer, then in his case it is better to do that which is more beneficial for him.

      "title": "She did not know that it was obligatory to do ghusl; does she have to make up the prayers?",
      "question": "<p>I did not know that if anything comes out of a woman as the result of desire, it is obligatory to do ghusl. I came to know that two years after I reached puberty when my periods began. After that, I began to do ghusl after anything came out. The problem is that I do not know how many prayers I offered without being purified, but I do not think they are too many because I always did ghusl after my menses. I am afraid that there may also be a number of days of Ramadaan when I fasted without being pure. I think that it happened three times but it may have been more. I made up the prayers of two weeks. Please advise me as to what I should do, because I am always thinking about this matter and how many times the shaytaan has whispered to me that I should become Muslim anew so that my past sins will be forgiven, but praise be to Allaah, I seek refuge with Him from the shaytaan and I do not do this awful thing.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the matter is as you     describe, then you do not have to make up the prayers that you offered     without being pure, according to a number of scholars, because you are     excused due to your not knowing. Please see question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/45648\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">45648</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is what seems to be     the case, if it did not occur to you that ghusl might be obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars say     that you do have to make up the prayers, because ignorance in your case is     not an excuse, as you live in a land where knowledge is widespread.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to be on the safe     side, you should make up the prayers that you offered without being pure,     and try to work out how many they were. If they are so many that it is too     hard for you to make them up, then we hope that there will be no sin on you     if you do not do that, but you should offer as many naafil prayers as you     can.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to fasting, you     do not have to make it up, because being pure is not a condition of fasting,     and the fasting of one who is junub is valid, but he has to do ghusl in     order to pray.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the waswasah     (whispers from the shaytaan) that you mention, this is a serious issue, and     we praise Allaah for having guided you to ignore it, because how could a     person do a greater evil, which is kufr, in the hope that he will be     forgiven! How does he know that he will become Muslim again after that?     Something may prevent him from becoming Muslim –Allaah forbid such a fate.     If this were the prescribed means of repenting then Islam would have taught     it, and it would have been advised in the case of one who commits serious     major sins, such as the one who killed a hundred souls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Give praise to Allaah for     the blessing of Islam and ask Him to make you righteous and steadfast;     strive to learn beneficial Islamic knowledge, for it will be an honour for     you&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to guide us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to say the iqaamah for prayer sitting when he is able to stand?",
      "question": "<p>If I give the iqaamah for prayer sitting or in another room other than the place where I am going to pray, is that allowed?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      The Sunnah is for the adhaan and iqaamah for prayer is to       be given standing. This is what the people have done from the time of the       Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the present day.       The one who gives the adhaan sitting or gives the iqaamah sitting with no       excuse has done a bad action and has gone against the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a matter on which the scholars are unanimously agreed     that there is no difference of opinion among them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/11):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is mustahabb for     the one who is reciting the iqaamah for prayer to do so standing, and it is     makrooh to do so sitting without an excuse, but if there is an excuse, there     is nothing wrong with it. … It is also makrooh to give the iqaamah whilst     walking or riding when travelling or otherwise without an excuse. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (15/264):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Giving the adhaan or iqaamah whilst sitting:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is makrooh for the     muezzin to give the adhaan whilst sitting except with an excuse, or if he is     giving the adhaan for himself, as the Hanafis and Maalikis say, because the     Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed Bilaal to     stand when he said: “Get up and give the call to prayer.” The muezzins of     the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to     give the adhaan whilst standing. And because standing makes the voice carry     further, and giving the adhaan and iqaamah whilst sitting is contrary to the     practice that has been handed down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Among the Hanbalis, Ibn Haamid said: If he gives the adhaan     whilst sitting, it is invalid. This was the view of Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen,     who said that the adhaan given by one who is sitting down is not acceptable.     And Abu’l-Baqa’ narrated that it should be repeated if he gave the adhaan     whilst sitting down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of one who has an excuse, there is nothing wrong     with him giving the adhaan whilst sitting. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-‘Abdi     said: I saw Abu Zayd, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him), whose legs had been injured (in jihad) for the     sake of Allah, giving the adhaan whilst sitting. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Sunnah is not to walk whilst giving the iqaamah, and to     give the iqaamah in the place where one is going to pray, so that there will     not be an interval between the iqaamah and starting the prayer, and because     the iqaamah is an announcement that the prayer is about to begin. So one     should start to pray immediately after reciting the iqaamah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad said in his Masaa’il     (61/220): I said to my father: Can a man walk whilst saying the iqaamah? He     said: I like him to stay where he is. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ishaaq ibn Raahaywayh said: As for the muezzin, once he     starts to say the iqaamah, if he is the imam, he should not walk during the     iqaamah until he finishes it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Masaa’il al-Imam Ahmad wa Ishaaq,     2/836&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Taking payment for reciting Qur’aan over a sick person",
      "question": "<p>We heard that some of those who use the Qur’aan for treatment – by reading Qur’aan and du’aa’s prescribed in sharee’ah over water or perfumed oil for the treatment of sihr (witchcraft), the evil eye and the touch of the Shaytaan (madness) – take payment for doing that. Is this permissible according  to sharee’ah? Does reciting over oil or water come under the same ruling as reciting over the patient himself for the purpose of treatment?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is nothing wrong with taking payment for treating the sick by           means of ruqyah, because           it was reported in al-Saheehayn           that a group of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) went           to a tribe among the Arabs who did not offer them hospitality. Their           chief was stung, and they did everything but to no avail. Then they           came to that group of Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and           said, “Is there any raaqi           (one who does ruqyah)           among you? For our chief have been stung.” They said, “Yes, but you           did not offer us hospitality, so we will not do ruqyah           for him unless we make a deal.” So they agreed upon a number of sheep,           then one of the Sahaabah did ruqyah           for him by reciting Soorat al-Faatihah,           and he recovered. They gave them what had been agreed upon, then the           Sahaabah said to one another, “Let us not do anything until we tell           the Prophet  (peace and blessings           of Allaah be upon him).” When they came to Madeenah, they told him about           it and he said, “You did the right thing.” There is nothing wrong with           reciting into water or oil to treat the sick, the one who is affected           by sihr (witchcraft) or           the insane, but reciting over the sick person and blowing onto him is           better and is preferable. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him)           narrated with a hasan isnaad           that the Prophet  (peace and blessings           of Allaah be upon him) recited into water for Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas,           then he poured it over him. The Prophet            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There is nothing           wrong with ruqyah so long           as it does not involve shirk.”           This saheeh hadeeth includes the sick person doing ruqyah           for himself, and doing ruqyah           by reciting into water, oil, etc. And Allaah is the Source of strength.&nbsp; </p>\n",

      "title": "A righteous young man is overwhelmed with worry and anxiety. What is the remedy?",
      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>There is a young man who is suffering from psychological distress, depression and worry, and he does not know what is the cause. Please note that he prays qiyaam al-layl and fasts a great deal, and he prays (the five daily prayers), but sometimes he sleeps and misses a prayer. He attends Islamic classes and reads books, and he is trying to memorize the Quran, and he listens to Islamic tapes. Despite that he is suffering from depression and worry. Please also note that this young man loves his paternal aunt a great deal and was always helping her, and the aunt is in good health.</div>\n<div>I hope that you will answer me as soon as possible so that this young man can be helped. Thank you very much.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We are happy to see your concern for this young man and your eagerness to find an effective remedy to offer him in the hope that Allah will benefit him thereby. By doing that you are strengthening the ties of Islamic brotherhood. We hope that Allah will reward you for that.</p>\n<p>You have explained this young man’s situation, and we will reply in the following points:</p>\n<p>1 – In this dunya (this world – the name in Arabic carries connotations both of that which is close and that which is base and vile), a man’s life is not consistent, rather his circumstances will vary between that which he likes and that which he does not like.&nbsp; The wise man, when he thinks about this world, will realize that he needs to develop an optimistic outlook and put an end to worries and distress that could disturb him and cause him stress.</p>\n<p>What the Shaytaan wants to do is to cause the Muslim grief and stress. Being introverted and thinking constantly about pain and sorrow gives the Shaytaan a great opportunity and may cause the worries and stress to multiply. Looking forward to a happy life and being optimistic is one of the means of feeling content and at peace. It is known that this world is a mixture of ease and hardship, joy and sorrow, hope and pain, so why should a person help the dark side to prevail over the bright side?</p>\n<p>Wisdom dictates that if a man cannot make optimism prevail, then at the very least he should think in a balanced and objective manner.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Feelings of stress and that life is too hard do not control a man's mind unless there are reasons that provoke these kinds of feelings. Rather they are indicative that the relationship between a person and his Lord is not sound. The more a man turns to Allah and focuses on Him, the more he will feel a sense of peace and comfort, to an extent that no one knows except Allah. Hence those who know Allah, are close to Him and fear Him are the happiest of people, to such an extent that one of them said, in a well known expression: “If the kings and the sons of kings knew what joy we have, they would fight us for it with the sword.” This is also what is expressed in the Quran, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”&nbsp;[al-Nahl 16:97]</p>\n<p>But feeling stressed is a kind of wake-up call that alerts a person to check on his relationship with his Lord, because sins may have the effect of making a person feel scattered and unfocused. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection”&nbsp;[Ta-Ha 20:124]</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of goodness in the young man whom you are asking about, for he is a person who is keen to seek knowledge, and he does naafil acts of worship such as fasting, and he upholds ties of kinship with his aunt. However you must draw his attention to the fact that he has to check on his relationship with Allah, for there may be some sin that is preventing him from achieving this sense of happiness, some sin that he has committed with regard to the rights of Allah or the rights of others. So encourage him to repent and seek forgiveness a great deal, especially since you said that he sometimes sleeps and misses the prayer – this is a serious matter although many people take it lightly.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>It may be that this test of this person through disasters and calamities is something that has been decreed by Allah for him in order to raise him in status, if he persists in obeying what Allah has commanded, which is to be patient and accept whatever Allah decrees. Everything that Allah decrees for a believer is good for him and his affairs, both spiritual and worldly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one except a believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is also good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)</p>\n<p>If something bad happens to a believer, he either bears it with patience or panics. If he is patient he earns a great reward and accepts the will and decree of Allah, because he knows that it comes from Allah, so he feels content with it and accepts it. So what reason is there to panic and feel stressed?</p>\n<p>On the contrary, if he is not patient and he reacts to what befalls him of sin with panic and anger, and worry and stress, he will lose the reward that Allah has promised to those who are patient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning”&nbsp;[al-Zumar 39:10]</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>He should sincerely turn towards Allah and call upon Him (du’a’), beseeching Him to relieve him of this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) and seeking refuge in Him a great deal from the accursed Shaytaan. For it annoys the Shaytaan to see a believing slave feeling peace of mind and contentment, so he whispers to him to distract him from that and make him fearful and confused.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us a du’aa’ by which we may ward off worries and distress. Ahmad (3528) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatika naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qurana rabee’ qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa’ huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, should we learn this?” He said: “Of course; everyone who hears it should learn it.”</p>\n<p>(Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199)</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>Try to suggest that he change something in his daily routine, to allow himself the opportunity to do different kinds of permissible things that will relieve him of boredom and renew his energy. There is nothing wrong with travelling for leisure purposes or to relax, so long he does not go to extremes. Even better than that is if he can travel for the purpose of ‘Umrah and to visit the Prophet’s mosque, because a change of scene can be very beneficial.</p>\n<p>Sixthly:</p>\n<p>He has to keep away from places that he feels make his worry and distress worse, or that stir these feeling up again. He should avoid reading novels that tell sad stories, and he should try not to sit with people who are worried and distressed, even if his intention is to console them.&nbsp; On the contrary, he should try to read useful books that will take him away from these worries. If he feels stressed and upset, he should not isolate himself or think constantly about his problems in this situation.</p>\n<p>Finally:</p>\n<p>Our advice to this young man is that he should raise his head and look forward, and view the future with optimism and the certainty that he will succeed. I say to him: You have a great deal of potential for success and high achievement, and a lot is to be expected of someone like you. We hope that these troubles and worries will be lifted from you. May Allah make things easy for you and relieve you of your distress and worry.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>    No zakaah is due on properties that are prepared for rental;     rather zakaah is due on the rent that is paid on them, subject to two     conditions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-That it reaches the minimum     threshold at which zakaah becomes due (nisaab)</p>\n<p>    2-That one full hijri year has     passed (since acquiring it).</p>\n<p>    The year starts from when you sign the contract, whether the     rent is paid in advance at the beginning of the year or at the end of the     year. If it was received at the beginning of the year and the year has     passed, then zakaah must be paid on it, or on what is left of it if some has     been spent and some is left.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If it is received at the end of the year then zakaah must be     paid on it, because one year has passed since the contract was signed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Mughni (4/271):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person rents out     his house for two years for forty dinars, the rent is considered to have     come into his possession at the time of the contract, and he has to pay     zakaah on the whole amount when one year has passed. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about a man who rented out some     property and received payment for one year in advance, and he used it to pay     off some debts – does he have to pay zakaah on this rent?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: No zakaah is due on rent in such a case, where it     was received from the renter in advance and he used it to pay off a debt,     because a full year did not pass since it came into his possession. What     counts here is the date of the rental contact until the end of the year. If     he received the rent before the end of the year and used it to pay off a     debt or he spent it on things needed for the house, then no zakaah is due on     it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz,     14/177&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen     was asked about properties that are prepared for rent – is zakaah due on     them?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    No zakaah is due on these properties, because the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not     have to pay zakaah on his slave or his horse.” Rather zakaah is due on the     rent, if one full year has passed since the contract was drawn up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example: a man rents     out his house for ten thousand, and he receives ten thousand after one year     has passed; he has to pay zakaah on this ten thousand, because one year has     passed since the contract was drawn up. Another man rented out his house for     ten thousand – five thousand of which he received at the time of signing the     contract, and which spent within two months, and five thousand to be paid     halfway through the year, which he took and spent within two months. When     the year is over, he has nothing left of the rent, so no zakaah is due on     it, because it did not spend one full year in his possession, and zakaah is     only due if it has spent one year in his possession. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,     18/208&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows     best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Selling things that we are not permitted to wear",
      "question": "<p>I heard some people say that it is permissible to sell and to sew women’s dresses that do not cover the woman properly – i.e., short dresses – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave to Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) a red silk garment, and when ‘Umar wore it and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him, he said, “I gave it to you so that you could give it as a gift, not so that you could wear it.” So ‘Umar gave it to someone who had been one of his friends during the Jaahiliyyah. <br />\nIs this view correct? <br />\nIf it is correct, then can we draw the analogy from this that it is permissible to sell cigarettes, tobacco, women’s pants and revealing swimsuits for men and women, even though Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br />\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”<br />\n[al-Maa’idah 5:2] ? <br />\nI hope you can explain. May Allaah bless you and keep you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2104) and Muslim (2068) and others, in several places and via several isnaads. For example, al-Bukhaari narrated it under the heading Baab al-Tijaarah fima yukrah libsuhu li’l-rijaali wa’l-nisa’ (Chapter on dealing in things that are makrooh for men and women), via Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar from his father, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a hullah (garment) of silk and he saw him wearing it and said, “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for the one who wears it is one who has no share (in the Hereafter). Rather I sent it to you so that you could make use of it,” i.e., sell it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to deal in clothes that may be used in one way but not in another, and it is permissible to give them to others, and the one who buys such a thing or to whom it is given has to use it in ways that are permissible, not in ways that are forbidden. Examples of that include gold jewellery, weapons, knives, grapes and other things that may be used for halaal or haraam purposes. It is permissible to deal in them and to give them to others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The one who buys or is given such things must use them in ways that are permissible, such as selling them, giving them as gifts, etc; he should not use them in any way that is forbidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the thing is something that is forbidden to use in any way, then it is not permissible to deal in it or to give it as a gift, such as pigs, lions and wolves. There is nothing in the hadeeth to suggest that it is permissible to sell the things mentioned in the question, so it is not valid to draw an analogy between selling cigarettes, tobacco and revealing swimsuits for men and woman and selling things that may be used in one way but not another, or under some circumstances but not others, because it is haraam to use them in all circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "An airline steward is asking: is it permissible for me to offer alcohol to passengers?",
      "question": "<p>Dear Shaykh, I would like to know which of these two things is better: for a man to work as an airline steward, and on some trips some kinds of alcohol are offered. Is it better to conceal the alcohol so that the passengers do not see it, and therefore do not ask for it except in rare cases, or to show the alcohol as usual, because it is the passengers’ right?… Is there a difference between the two matters in terms of sin for the one who serves alcohol once a month, and the one who serves it ten times?… Please note that both men are not pleased with this blameworthy act that is imposed on them by the company.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\t\tWhat the Muslim must do is fear Allah with regard to his \t\twork, and seek out earnings that are lawful and wholesome. Allah has \t\tmade every person accountable for his actions and He will ask him about \t\this earnings: from where did he acquire them and on what did he spend \t\tthem? Anything that comes under the heading of disobedience to Allah or \t\tdisobedience to the Messenger must be avoided, and the Muslim must avoid \t\thelping others with it, and he should strive to put a stop to it, \t\tbecause Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, \trighteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \ttransgression”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Maa’idah 5:2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tUndoubtedly alcohol is the mother of all evils. The Prophet \t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed ten people with regard to \talcohol: The one who presses (the grapes, etc), the one for whom they are \tpressed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it \tis carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, the one who consumes \tits price, the one who purchases it, and the one for whom it is purchased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (1295); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt is not permissible for the airline steward to serve \talcohol to the passengers, because that comes under the heading of approving \tof evil and helping others with it. What he must do is pour it away or \tdestroy it, if he is able to do so; at the very least he should prevent \tthose who want to consume it, and tell them not to do that. Otherwise it is \tnot permissible for him to do this job in which he is not able to denounce \tevil and, rather, he is encouraged to help others to do it. He has to give \tup this job and look for a lawful means of earning a living and permissible \twork.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tWhat is the ruling on an airline steward who is obliged to \tcarry alcohol on board the plane, and what should he do?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThey replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tDrinking alcohol is prohibited, and selling it and \tmanufacturing it is prohibited, and serving it to one who will drink it is \tprohibited, because the one who serves it is helping the one who drinks it \tto commit sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, \tsays(interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, \trighteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \ttransgression”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Maa’idah 5:2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tBased on that, it is not permissible to remain in the job \tmentioned. The ways of earning a living are many, and Allah, may He be \tglorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will \tmake a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</p>\n<p>\t3.&nbsp;And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \timagine”</p>\n<p>\t[al-Talaaq 65:2-3].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (22/ 96)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt is not permissible for the airline steward to serve \talcohol to the passengers, whether in small or great amounts, and whether he \tserves it once or more than that. All of that is prohibited, although \tprohibited things vary in degree, and the one who commits a sin several \ttimes incurs a greater burden of sin than one who does it just once, and so \ton.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe questioner’s saying that alcohol is the right of the \tpassenger is completely incorrect. How can it be his right when Allah has \tcursed the one who drinks it?! Whatever rights people claim that are \tcontrary to the commands and rulings of Allah, those rights are invalid, \tbecause they are not rights at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe fact that both stewards do not approve does not make it \tpermissible for them to cooperate in doing evil deeds and exposing \tthemselves to the wrath and curse of Allah – Allah forbid; rather not \tapproving means that one should not participate in the sin, or sit in the \tplace where it is being committed, as Allah, may He be exalted, says \t(interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>\t“And it has \talready been revealed to you in the Book (this Quran) that when you hear the \tVerses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until \tthey engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) \tcertainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will collect \tthe hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”</p>\n<p>\t[an-Nisa’ 4:140].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tShaykh as-Sa ‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAllah has explained to you – in what He has revealed to you – \tthat His shar‘i rulings to be followed when attending gatherings in which \tdisbelief and sin are present:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this \tQuran) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at” \tthat is, being belittled. That is because what is required of every \taccountable person with regard to the Revelations of Allah is to believe in \tthem, then venerate them and respect them. That is the purpose for which \tthey were revealed, and it is the purpose for which Allah created His \tcreation. The opposite of belief is rejection of them, and the opposite of \trespecting them is mocking them and scorning them. That includes the \targuments that the disbelievers and hypocrites may come up with to \tinvalidate the Revelations of Allah and support their disbelief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe same also applies to innovators of various types. Their \targument in support of their falsehood implies disrespect towards the \tRevelations of Allah, because the revelation only supports the truth, and \tdoes not contain anything but truth. And in fact this also applies to \tattending gatherings of sin and immorality, in which the commands and \tprohibitions of Allah are flouted and the limits that He has set for His \tslaves are transgressed. This ruling also includes the prohibition on \tsitting with them, “until they engage in a talk other than that” that \tis, until they begin to talk about things other than disbelief in the \tRevelations of Allah and ridiculing them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t“(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case” \tthat is, if you sit with them in the situation mentioned,</p>\n<p>\t“you would be like them” because then you would be \tapproving of their disbelief and ridicule, and the one who approves of sin \tis like the one who does it. The point is that whoever attends a gathering \tin which Allah is disobeyed is obliged to object to them if he is able to, \tor to get up and leave if he is not able to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di (210)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tConclusion:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt is not permissible for you to carry alcohol, or to give it \tto any of the passengers, and even if the company orders you to do that, \tthere is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience \ttowards the Creator. In fact the minimum that you must do is hide it, and do \tnot let the passengers see it. If one of them looks for it, do not tell him \twhere it is, and if it so happens that one of them asks for it, and insists \ton what the company has allowed him, you should not be the one who gives it \tto him, or play any part in that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tPlease see also the answers to questions no.\t<a href=\"/en/answers/1830\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">1830</a> and <a href=\"/en/answers/96739\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">96739</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on using an electronic rak‘ah-counter whilst praying",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to use an electronic counter that counts automatically, without any intervention from the worshipper or anyone else, to count the number of rak‘ahs that the worshipper does, so that he can be certain of the number of rak‘ahs that he has prayed, in the event of error or forgetfulness, whether in an obligatory or naafil prayer? I have produced a device that does this, and it works on the basis of a very small detector (with a thickness of 1-2mm) that is placed under the prayer mat or directly beneath the forehead of the worshipper, and it counts the number of prostrations, on the basis of which it works out the number of rak‘ahs that the worshipper has done, then it shows them on a small digital screen in front of the worshipper. If you need more explanation, I can send some pictures or a video to show how it works. Please advise me, may Allah bless you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\t\tFirstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tCounting the number of rak‘ahs in the prayer is something for \twhich there is a precedent in the practice and words of the early \tgenerations. Their methods of counting varied according to their \tenvironments and times. Some of them used to use their rings, some used date \tstones or pebbles, and others used their fingers or toes. All of this \tconfirms that there is a basis for using such a device to count the number \tof prostrations and rak‘ahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIbn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\t</p>\n<p>\tAl-Fadl ibn Shaadhaan quoted in his book ‘Add al-Aayi \twa’r-Rak ‘aat fi’s-Salaah the hadith of ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim \tfrom his father, from ‘Aa’ishah, according to which, when she offered an \tobligatory prayer, she would count her prayer with her ring, moving it on \ther hand until she finished her prayer, and counting with it.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from al-Khawaatim by Ibn Rajab (p. 109). The \tisnaad going back to ‘Aa’ishah is saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAl-Kharashi al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tMoving the ring from one finger to another in order to count \tthe rak‘ahs when one is afraid of forgetting does not come under the heading \tof fidgeting, because that is being done in the interests of the prayer.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (1/294)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIn Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen (1/650) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIt says in al-Bahr: With regard to moving the tips of \tthe fingers (to keep count) or counting in one’s mind, that is not makrooh, \taccording to consensus, but counting out loud spoils the prayer, according \tto consensus. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tMuhammad al-Baabirti al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) \tsaid:</p>\n<p>\t… It was narrated from Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad that there is \tnothing wrong with counting on the hand. He mentioned the hand specifically, \tbecause moving the tips of the fingers (to keep count) or counting in one’s \tmind is not makrooh, according to consensus, but he warned against counting \tout loud, because it spoils the prayer.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from al-‘Inaayah Sharh al-Hidaayah (1/418)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tShaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tHe may count the number of rak‘ahs, and there may be a need \tto do so, because many people may forget and resort to counting them on \ttheir fingers, in which case there is a problem, because when the worshipper \tbows, he has to spread his fingers, and when he prostrates, his fingers must \tbe straight. Therefore he may count them using pebbles or date stones. So he \tcan put four dates stones in his pocket, then when he has prayed the first \trak‘ah, he can move one of them, and so on until they are finished. There is \tnothing wrong with this, because there is a need for it, especially when one \tis very forgetful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni‘ \t(3/249, 250).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tSecondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tBut in the case of this counter and similar inventions, there \tare a number of concerns:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t1.\tThe worshipper may be distracted by looking at it and \tthinking about its numbers. In most cases he will not be content with the \tnumber of the sajdah or rak‘ah until he thinks it over so that he may be \tsure that it is correct. This is something that may cause the device to miss \tits original purpose, which is to help one to focus in prayer and not be \tdistracted by anything outside the prayer.</p>\n<p>\t2.\tThere are essential parts and obligatory acts in the \tprayer that the device does not take into account. There may be a mistake in \tthe recitation of al-Faatihah, or the worshipper may forget to sit for the \tfirst tashahhud, or he may not bow at all, but the device may count it as a \trak‘ah because he prostrated twice! In which case the benefit from it may be \tlimited or completely absent. Similar problems may arise if there is a \tprostration of recitation (sujood at-tilaawah) during the prayer.</p>\n<p>\tThirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tWith regard to our opinion concerning this device and similar \tdevices, we say:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIslam came to enjoin presence of mind when praying, and it \thas prescribed clear rulings for the one who loses focus and makes mistakes \tin his prayer. If he loses focus and does not know how many rak‘ahs he has \tprayed, then he should proceed on the basis of the lower number, then do the \tprostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam. It is also prescribed \tfor him to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytaan and to spit drily to his \tleft when he realises that he has become distracted in his prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tWhat we think is that it is permissible and useful for one \twho is faced with compulsive whispers, or is very forgetful and that is \tcausing him some difficulties, if it will benefit him in his prayer and will \tfulfil its purpose by helping him to focus on his prayer. But in ordinary \tcases, when there is no particular need for such things, we do not think \tthat a person should use it; rather there is the fear that it may come under \tthe heading of blameworthy unnecessary effort and things that people have \tintroduced into the matter of worship that are detrimental to the original \tpurpose of focusing the heart on Allah, and praying with proper humility, so \tyou see him giving free rein to the thoughts and whispers that come to him, \trelying on the device to count his prayer for him!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows best.    </p>\n",
