      "question": "What is the ruling on someone who speaks words of kufr due to compulsive waswaas (obsessive thoughts) that overwhelm them?",
      "options": [
        "He is not deemed an apostate if he speaks under pressure of waswaas without intent or awareness, similar to one who is forced",
        "He must renew his Islam and repeat the shahada after each episode of speaking words of kufr caused by waswaas",
        "He is deemed an apostate unless he can prove through medical documentation that he has OCD diagnosed by a specialist",
        "He bears full responsibility for his words unless he immediately seeks treatment from a psychologist and performs ruqya"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A person suffering from compulsive waswaas who speaks words of kufr under its pressure without awareness or intent is not deemed an apostate, as this is beyond their control. The Quran states that one who is forced to disbelief while their heart is at rest with faith is not a disbeliever (An-Nahl 16:106). The person comes under the same ruling as one forced to speak words of kufr."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on tawarruq involving metals with al-Jazeera Bank as described in the question?",
      "options": [
        "It is permissible if you personally take possession of the metal and sell it yourself to someone other than the dealer the bank bought from",
        "It is permissible as long as a religious council supervises the transaction, as al-Jazeera Bank has arranged",
        "It is haram according to the Islamic Fiqh Council regardless of whether you sell the metal yourself or delegate the bank",
        "It is permissible only if you use property as guarantee and receive 60-70% of its value in the metal transaction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Tawarruq involving metals is permissible only if the customer actually takes possession of the metals and then personally sells them to someone other than the dealer from whom the bank bought them. If the customer delegates the bank to sell, this becomes organized tawarruq which the Islamic Fiqh Council has ruled as haram. Dr. Muhammad al-'Usaymi stated these specific conditions must be met for it to be permissible."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on proceeding with an action when you are unsure whether it is sinful or not, without asking about the ruling first?",
      "options": [
        "It is not permissible to do something without knowing its ruling; you must learn before acting, and failing to ask due to negligence is a sin",
        "You bear no sin if you proceed without asking, as long as you had the sincere intention to ask about it eventually",
        "You only need to ask if you're certain it might be haram; if you're merely unsure, you may proceed and ask later",
        "Knowledge is required only for obligatory acts like prayer and zakah, not for permissible transactions like buying and selling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Muslim must learn before acting and it is not permissible to proceed with something when they don't know the ruling on it. Allah says: 'And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge' (Al-Isra 17:36). One who fails to ask about what they're uncertain of due to negligence and following desires is being heedless about their religion and deserves punishment, as stated by Ibn al-Qayyim."

      "question": "What must someone do who prayed behind an imam for five years while aware that the imam was an apostate who reviled Allah?",
      "options": [
        "He must repeat all those prayers, striving to work out how many there were until he is certain he has made up what he owes",
        "His prayers are invalid on the imam's part but valid on his part since he was following in prayer in good faith",
        "He must repeat the prayers only if the signs of the imam's disbelief were obvious and clear to everyone",
        "He must repent sincerely and increase voluntary prayers, but making up the missed prayers is not obligatory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Prayers offered behind an apostate imam while aware of his apostasy are invalid and must be repeated. The person must strive to determine how many prayers were offered until they think it most likely they have made up all that was missed. If the number is great but causes hardship, they should keep making them up until certain all have been completed, as stated by Ibn Qudamah in Al-Mughni."

      "question": "What is the proper Islamic understanding regarding Allah appointing angels to manage affairs of the universe?",
      "options": [
        "Submitting to Allah's wisdom without questioning why is fundamental to faith; the angels demonstrate His perfect lordship and instill proper fear and hope in believers",
        "Allah appointed angels to manage affairs because delegation is necessary for the efficient running of the universe's complex systems",
        "Knowing the specific wisdom behind each angel's particular task is a necessary component for complete faith in the angels",
        "The angels were created primarily to highlight the perfect order and systematic design of the universe to increase human understanding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The perfect nature of Allah's wisdom is well established, and submitting to it is a fundamental of faith. The basis of servitude is submission without asking about details of wisdom behind commands. The angels demonstrate Allah's perfect lordship and divinity, and belief in them instills proper fear, love and hope. As Ibn Abi'l-'Izz stated, the early generations never questioned why Allah decreed something, as that is contrary to faith and submission."

      "question": "Where should a woman observe her 'iddah when her husband dies after the marriage contract but before consummating the marriage?",
      "options": [
        "In her family's house where she was living when her husband died, not in the husband's house",
        "In the husband's house that she was going to move to after the marriage was consummated",
        "She may choose between her family's house and the husband's house based on which is more convenient for her",
        "She is not required to observe 'iddah at all since the marriage was never consummated before his death"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The woman should observe 'iddah in her family's house where she was living when her husband died, because she had not yet moved to the husband's house. Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen was asked this specific question and replied that she should observe 'iddah in her family's house since she had not yet moved to the husband's house. She must observe 'iddah for four months and ten days despite the marriage not being consummated."

      "question": "What is the correct Islamic approach to understanding why deeds are shown to Allah daily, weekly, and annually according to the Sunnah?",
      "options": [
        "We must submit to what is proven in authentic Sunnah without questioning the wisdom; the foundation of faith is acceptance and surrender",
        "The daily showing is for minor deeds, weekly showing for moderate deeds, and annual showing for major deeds requiring deeper review",
        "The repeated showing at different intervals ensures accuracy since recording angels can occasionally make errors in documenting deeds",
        "Each type of showing serves a distinct purpose: daily for warning, weekly for accountability records, and annually for final judgment preparation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The showing of deeds daily, weekly and annually is proven in authentic Sunnah, and we must submit without questioning why. The criterion is making the Qur'an and Sunnah our foundation and surrendering to them. As Imam az-Zuhri said: 'Allah sends the message, the Messenger conveys it; our role is to accept and submit.' Questioning divine wisdom after it's been established contradicts faith and leads to confusion and doubts."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on a mother performing the 'aqeeqah for her child when the father is absent or unavailable?",
      "options": [
        "The 'aqeeqah is Sunnah (not obligatory), primarily the father's duty, but it is mustahabb for the mother if the father refuses or is unable due to distance or being unaware",
        "The 'aqeeqah is obligatory on the father, and the mother may do it only with the father's explicit written permission beforehand",
        "The 'aqeeqah is mustahabb for both parents equally, and either parent may offer it without consulting or informing the other",
        "If the parents are not married, the 'aqeeqah becomes obligatory on the mother since the father has no financial responsibility"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'aqeeqah is Sunnah and mustahabb but not obligatory according to the majority of scholars. The basic principle is that it should be done from the wealth of the father. However, it is permissible and mustahabb for the mother to offer it if the father refuses or is unable to do so because he is far away or unaware of the birth. Allah will record the reward for her in such cases."

      "question": "According to the hadith, what is meant by 'he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him' regarding one focused on worldly gain?",
      "options": [
        "Caring excessively for worldly gain won't increase provision beyond what's decreed; what's decreed will come but with exertion and hardship unlike for one focused on the hereafter",
        "One whose main concern is the hereafter will receive more provision than what was originally decreed and written for him in Allah's knowledge",
        "One focused only on worldly gain will receive his decreed provision but it will be delayed and he will experience constant fear of poverty",
        "Provision can be increased beyond what's decreed through hard work and effort, regardless of whether one's focus is worldly or spiritual"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "What has been decreed for a person will inevitably come to them regardless. Caring excessively for worldly gain will not increase provision beyond what's been decreed and written. For one who seeks the hereafter, provision comes without undue exertion; for one who seeks worldly gain, it comes with exertion and hardship. As-Sindi explained: both will receive what's decreed, but the one seeking the hereafter achieves both worldly and hereafter gains, while the other loses in both."

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on women issuing fatwas and being scholars?",
      "options": [
        "Islam doesn't differentiate between men and women in issuing fatwas; scholars didn't stipulate the mufti must be male, and many women throughout Islamic history were known as muftis",
        "Women may issue fatwas only to other women and only in matters specifically related to women's jurisprudential affairs",
        "Women may issue fatwas, but there is no difference between being a mufti and being a qaadi (judge) in terms of qualifications",
        "Women's fatwas are considered valid only if they are subsequently reviewed and confirmed by a male scholar according to the majority view"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Islam does not differentiate between men and women regarding knowledge and issuing fatwas. An-Nawawi listed the conditions for a mufti and did not include being male, stating 'this applies equally to one who is free, a slave, a woman...' Many women in Islamic history were known scholars and muftis, foremost among them 'Aa'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). However, being a mufti differs from being a qaadi (judge), which women cannot be appointed to."
