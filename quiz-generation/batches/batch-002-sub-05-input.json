      "title": "Divorcing a wife because of her bad attitude",
      "question": "<p>My brother-in-law had a miserable married life for last two years. his wife used to behave badly with him and the worst thing the girl used to torture /abuse her mother-in-law .<br />\n<br />\nAfter many tormenting and disgusting discussions the boy,his mother, his father and his sister decided divorce is the only solution and he divorced. Please clarify whether the stance taken was right or not? .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The basic principle concerning divorce is     that it is makrooh. This is indicated by the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait for four months,     then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>227.&nbsp;And if they decide upon divorce, then     Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:226]</p>\n<p>With regard to the oath not to have sexual     relations, Allaah says “Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”, but with regard to divorce, He says, “All-Hearer, All-Knower”. This contains     an element of warning, and this indicates that divorce is makrooh or disliked by Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there may be some situations in which there is no alternative to divorce, and matters     may reach a point where divorce becomes essential. In a situation such as that mentioned in the question, divorce is an appropriate solution,     because one of the rights that a husband has over his wife is that she should respect his family, especially the husband’s mother. The mother’s     rights over a man come before his wife’s rights, so the wife should help her husband to honour his mother.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that divorce is permissible in     cases where it is needed because of the wife’s bad attitude and bad conduct and because she is causing too much harm and not doing what she is     supposed to do. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mughni,     10/324&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

Thus they came from the same source, and as that is the case there cannot be any contradiction or conflict between them, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.} [An-Nisa’ 4:82]</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, describes the Glorious Quran as “confirming” the Books that came before it, and that which confirms something cannot contradict or conflict with it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (Muhammad ) with truth, confirming what came before it. And he sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).</p>\n<p>Aforetime, as a guidance to mankind, And He sent down the criterion (of judgement between right and wrong (this Quran)).} [Al `Imran 3:3-4]</p>\n<p>{And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad ) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).} [Al-Ma’idah 5:48]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Distortions_in_the_Torah_and_Gospel_over_Time\">Distortions in the Torah and Gospel over Time</span></h3>\n<p>As for what we see nowadays of contradictions in the copies of the Torah and Gospel that are extant today, the reason for that is clear and obvious. It is because these two Books have fallen prey to distortion and alteration, with things being taken away, added and changed. That is in addition to the fact that the sources and manuscripts that have come down to us today cannot be trusted.</p>\n<p>This is what explains any differences that researchers or students find between these two Books and the Glorious Quran which has been transmitted to us in a Mutawatir fashion (i.e., narrated by so many from so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie), as is attested by both believers and nonbelievers.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Biblical_Mentions_of_Ibrahims_Journey_to_Makkah\">Biblical Mentions of Ibrahim’s Journey to Makkah</span></h3>\n<p>Nevertheless we say that Ibrahim’s arrival in the land of Makkah Al-Mukarramah – and indeed his building of the Sacred House – are historical events that are attested to in the Torah and other ancient historical books.</p>\n<p>We cannot deny the fact that there are different interpretations of these texts of the Torah and so on, and that the context is open to different interpretations. Our aim here is to confirm that such indications exist. However, the matter should be left to scholars to examine the story in the Old Testament, in order to reach a definitive conclusion.</p>\n<p>These references include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the book of Genesis 16:7 it says, after mentioning the story of Ibrahim (Abraham) going in unto Hajar (Hagar) and her becoming pregnant, then Sarai’s [Sarah’s] complaint to Ibrahim about her:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Biblical quotations in English are taken from the King James Version (KJV); some place names have been changed, followed by the place name, in brackets, that is mentioned in the KJV. This is done in line with the point the author is making – see below]</p>\n<p>And when Sarai [Sarah] dealt hardly [harshly] with her, she fled from her face.</p>\n<p>7&nbsp;And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to the Hijaz (Shur).</p>\n<p>8&nbsp;And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>13&nbsp;And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</p>\n<p>14&nbsp;Wherefore the well was called Be’er lahai roi (Well of the Living One Who sees me); behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>\n<p>See how the name of the Hijaz is mentioned, and Hajar’s departure to that place, after which the blessing of the “Well of the Living One Who sees me” is bestowed by Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted; this is the Well of Zamzam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 13:1-18 it says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, towards the Qiblah (into the south).</p>\n<p>2&nbsp;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p>\n<p>3&nbsp;And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</p>\n<p>4&nbsp;Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>18&nbsp;Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 20:1 it also says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the land of the qiblah (the south country), and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>\n<p>We have quoted these texts [in the original Arabic of this article] from the Torah as translated into Arabic by Sa`id Al-Fayyumi, (d. 943 AH); the King James Version of the Bible has been used here].</p>\n<p>He was the first one to translate the Old Testament into Arabic. He also wrote a commentary for most of its books. We have not found this Torah anywhere else except in the book of Idris `Abizah entitled Madhkal ila Dirasat at-Tawrat wa Naqdiha ma`a Tarjamatihi Al-`Arabiyyah li Sa`diyya Ka’un Al-Fayyumi (Introduction to the Study and Critique of the Torah, accompanied by its Translation into Arabic by Sa`diyya Ka’un Al-Fayyumi).</p>\n<p>In other well-known translations of the Torah [into Arabic], instead of the Hijaz it mentions “by a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to Shur” (Genesis 16:7), and instead of the Qiblah it mentions “the south” (Genesis 13:1).</p>\n<p>[Translator’s note: some English translations say “Negev” instead of “the south’; in the Bible, this word is used for the direction “south”]</p>\n<p>For more information please see (in Arabic): Nabi Ard Al-Janub (Prophet of the Southern Land) by Jamal Ad-Din Ash-Sharqawi, p. 18-109)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 21:21 it says of Isma‘eel (peace be upon him):</li>\n</ul>\n<p>21&nbsp;And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>\n<p>This is how it appears in the Samaritan Torah (also known as the Samaritan Pentateuch), and in Al-Fayyumi’s translation of the Torah.</p>\n<p>Although many passages in the Torah suggest that Paran is in Palestine, Imam Al-Qarrafi said in his book Al-Ajwibah Al-Fakhirah (p. 165): Paran is Makkah, according to the consensus of the People of the Book. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in Al-Jawab As-Sahih liman baddala Din Al-Masih, 5/200):</p>\n<p>There is no difference of opinion between the Muslims and the People of the Book concerning the fact that Paran is Makkah. But if they say that it is not Makkah, there is nothing strange in that, because they are known for their distortions and fabrications.</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said concerning the region around Mount Hira’ in Makkah:</p>\n<p>That place is called Faran (Paran) to this day. (End quote)</p>\n<p>Abdul Haqq Vidyarthi (d. 1978 CE) stated in his famous book Muhammad in World Scriptures:</p>\n<p>In the Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch (Torah), which was published in 1851 CE, it says that Paran is located in the Hijaz, as follows:</p>\n<p>“And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 21:21).</p>\n<p>This translation remained in circulation for a long time, but when the Muslims alerted the Christian world to this prophecy, and that it constituted testimony to the truth of this Noble Prophet, the translation was changed. End quote</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Old Testament, in Psalms 84:5-6, 10, there is mention of the valley of Baca. This passage, in the King James Version (KJV), reads as follows:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5&nbsp;Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>\n<p>6&nbsp;Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>10&nbsp;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand (elsewhere).</p>\n<p>There is no valley on earth called Baca (or Bakkah) that contains a house of worship and a spring of water (Zamzam), in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, other than Makkah Al-Mukarramah.</p>\n<p>Baca (Bakkah) is one of the names of Makkah. This name is mentioned in the Glorious Quran, where Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning)”</p>\n<p>{Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-`Alamin (the mankind and jinns).} [Al `Imran 3:96]</p>\n<p>But the translators and commentators of the Old Testament distorted the word Baca to buka’ [weeping or crying; the Hebrew cognate denotes the same meaning], even though the meanings of place names should not be translated; rather the name should be transliterated, and even though the meaning of the (original) name has nothing to do with crying or weeping, as a result of their desire to eliminate all references to anything that is proven in the Glorious Quran, such distortions occurred.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we say:</p>\n<p>Even if nothing was mentioned in the Old Testament concerning Ibrahim’s journey to the Hijaz, that does not indicate that this journey did not happen at all.</p>\n<p>The well-known academic principle says that the fact that a thing is not mentioned does not mean that it did not happen. In other words, denying that something happened should take the form of a negative statement.</p>\n<p>The fact that no mention is made of its happening does not necessarily mean that it did not happen; rather the reason why it was not mentioned may be that it was omitted, forgotten, summarized in brief, and the like.</p>\n<p>If you find news of something in one newspaper, then you find that it is not mentioned at all in another newspaper, the fact that it is not mentioned in the latter does not mean that it did not happen. Whoever thinks in such terms is lacking in reason and is making no sense.</p>\n<p>This is also applicable in the case under discussion here.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we were to quote the words of non-Muslims who have investigated the story of the Ka`bah and who really built it, and have determined that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is the one who built it, this article would become far too long. But we will limit ourselves to quoting one of the most famous of contemporary history books, The Story of Civilization, by Will Durant. This book is composed of forty-two volumes in which the author discusses the history of most civilizations, including the history of the Arabian Peninsula, concerning which he says: “It (the Ka`bah) was built the fourth time by Abraham and Ishmael, his son from Hagar.

      "title": "He works in a restaurant and takes tips with the knowledge of the owner",
      "question": "<p>My father works in a tourist restaurant where there is no alcohol, only food and drink. He gets a share of the daily profits and a monthly salary. <br />\n<br />\nThe tourists come in buses and do not pay the bill after eating; rather it is the tour company that pays the bills for the food. <br />\n<br />\nDuring the meal, the bus drivers wait outside. <br />\n<br />\nThe owner gives my father some money every day and says to him: Give tips to the bus drivers. The owner of the restaurant and the owner of the tour company know about these tips, in the sense that is something regular for the owner of the tour company to give the driver a salary and tell him that the restaurants will give him tips. <br />\nAnd the driver has nothing to do with the tourist groups; rather he is just a driver.<br />\n<br />\nMy father also accepts tips with the knowledge of the owner of the restaurant; in fact the owner encourages him to accept them. <br />\nWhat is the ruling on my father's wealth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      We have previously discussed the ruling on accepting tips       and “baksheesh” in the answer to question no.      <a href=\"/en/answers/82497\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">82497</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the tips in this case are given with the knowledge of     the tour company for whom the driver is working, there is nothing wrong with     that, because the restaurant can give some of the money to the company, so     if it agrees to give it to the worker, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The same may be said with regard to what your father     receives: if it is with the knowledge of the owner of the restaurant, there     is nothing wrong with it, because the customer has the right to pay more     than the agreed price, and if the owner of the restaurant agrees to leave     this additional money for the worker, there is nothing wrong with that. But     the worker or employee has to do his job properly and give the customer his     rights in full, whether he gives him a tip or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: I     work for a transportation company and I transport refrigerated fruit and     vegetables from Madeenah to Jeddah or Makkah or Riyadh. When I arrive, the     one to whom I am making the delivery gives me some money, 100 or 200 riyals,     in appreciation for my delivering the vegetables to him quickly. Please note     that the owner of the company knows about that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    My question is: is this money or tip, as they call it, halaal     or haraam? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: We think that there is nothing wrong with you     taking the money that the owner of the grocery store gives to you when the     owner of the company is aware of that, and the aim behind that is to     encourage you to deliver the goods and take care of the vegetables before     they go rotten. As you deserve it because of your effort and you taking care     of the goods, and as it was given to you willingly by the owner, there is no     reason why you should not take it, even if it is in addition to the salary     for which you work. The aim behind it is to encourage you to carry on and to     do what is in their interests.

      "question": "<p>I am in need of immediate advise. I am afraid I am a produt of zina as my mother gave bith to me in less than 5 months after marriage. My parents got married when my mother was pregnant. I am not completely sure if the nikaah took place before the celebration but. I don't know how to ask my parents about this as am still young. Pls advise me on what to do. Am I considered my fathers' child?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    In His holy Book, Allah instructs us not     to enquire too deeply into matters that have nothing to do with our deeds     and which, if the truth became plain to a person, may cause him trouble.     Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Ask not about     things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask     about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to     you. Allah has forgiven that, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:101].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Tafseer Ibn Katheer (3/203) it     says:</p>\n<p>    Here Allah, may He be exalted, instructs     His believing slaves and tells them not to ask about things for which there     is no benefit for them in asking and enquiring about them, because if those     matters were made plain to them, it may cause them trouble and it may be     difficult for them to hear about them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The commentators mentioned as the reason     for revelation of this verse a situation that is similar to your situation     that you are asking about. One of the Sahaabah was uncertain about his     attribution to his father, and he wanted to find out about that by asking     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). But when he asked     him, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) answered his     question, Qur’an was revealed criticising this behaviour on the part of that     questioner and rebuking him for enquiring into such matters. Al-Bukhaari     (7089) and Muslim (2359) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him)     said: (The people) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) until he was hard pressed by their questioning. He ascended the minbar     one day, and said: “You will not ask me anything but I will explain it to     you.” I started to look to my right and my left, and every man had wrapped     his head in his garment and was weeping. A man (‘Abdullah ibn Hudhaafah) who     used to be slandered and attributed to someone other than his father [i.e.,     if he had a dispute with anyone, his opponent would attribute him to someone     other than his father] stood up in the mosque and said: O Prophet of Allah,     who is my father? He said: “Your father is Hudhaafah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Qataadah used to quote this hadeeth in     reference to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who     believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you     trouble” [al-Maa’idah 5:101].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Az-Zuhri said: The mother of ‘Abdullah ibn     Hudhaafah (who was the mother of the Sahaabi who asked this question) said:     I have never seen a son more disrespectful than you. How can you be sure     that your mother did not commit some of the sins committed by the women of     the Jaahiliyyah, thus you would have exposed her before the people?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we advise you to do is to refrain     from mentioning this matter and from wondering and asking about it. Do not     ask your parents or anyone else about it. You are definitely to be     attributed to your father, because you were born to his wife and the     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: The     child is for the (owner of the) bed (i.e. the husband). Narrated by al-Bukhaari     (2053) and Muslim (1457).&nbsp; We ask Allah to guide you and help you to do all     that is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Questions regarding divorce in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation, divorce during menses, and denying paternity of the child",
      "question": "<p>There is a husband who does not fulfil his duties and responsibilities towards his wife; rather instead of doing so, he mistreats her verbally, mentally and physically, and instead of spending on her he takes her money and spends it on his own interests. After all this suffering she is compelled to ask him for a divorce, but he refuses, then when her family intervenes, he says that he will divorce her, but that is on condition that she lets him off paying the mahr, and her family agreed to that and wrote a document on her behalf in which they agreed that she will give up her right to the mahr if he divorces her. At the same time, he wrote a document in which he said, “In light of the request of wise people among the family, and because of the misunderstanding that occurred between me and her (i.e., his wife), I am divorcing her thrice, and there will never be any relationship between me and her in the future, and I do not have any child from her.” This is despite the fact that he had slept with her two days before that, and he knew that she was pregnant from him. Therefore the questions are:<br />\nIs this talaaq or khula‘?<br />\nIf it is khula‘, does it come under the same rulings as talaaq with regard to taking the wife back? In other words, is there any chance of taking her back?<br />\nIf it is a talaaq, is it irrevocable and is it the case that he cannot take her back except after she has been married to another man? Or is this threefold talaaq only counted as a single talaaq, and therefore does he have the right to take her back?<br />\nIf it is a talaaq, then what about the mahr that her family forced her to give up to him? Does he have to pay it despite what was written about giving it up? As far as we know, the husband is excused from paying the mahr if the wife is the one who is asking for separation for no good reason, but he forced her to do that with his bad behavior and bad treatment, so I think the ruling is different. Of course this applies if we regard this as a case of khula‘, but if it is a talaaq then it is more appropriate that he should pay, isn’t it? From what we know also, talaaq must take place during a period of complete purity (from menses) in which he has not had intercourse with her, and that he must wait for one month after that, and the same applies in every talaaq until the three talaaqs have been used up, then after that he should pay the mahr; but if he says the three talaaqs in one go, that only counts as one talaaq. But there are some scholars who say that it counts as a threefold talaaq, hence she is irrevocably divorced. What is the correct opinion on all these details? I hope that you can clarify, because we are people with little knowledge, and we cannot find anyone we can rely on with regard to these sensitive matters except you. As far as I know, Allah hates divorce, hence He has allowed man three opportunities in which to rethink the matter and take his wife back. Perhaps anger may overtake him in the first instance, in which case he can take her back. But some of the Sunni scholars here say that divorce is divorce, and that it takes place in all situations; so long as he has uttered it three times, then it counts as a threefold divorce, and they quote some hadeeths as evidence for that. We hope that you can advise us about this matter. Finally, in that document the husband wrote that he had no child from her, at the time when she was carrying in her womb a child from him, and she will give birth to this baby seven or eight months from now. What are the rulings connected to that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly this husband – if he really did that – is mistreating his wife, depriving her of her rights, and going against what Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined upon him of treating her in a good manner. He should have been kind to his wife and given her her rights in full, and if he disliked her, he should have parted with her in a good manner, in obedience to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner” [at-Talaaq 65:2]. This husband is not keeping her in a good manner, because he is mistreating his wife, transgressing against her and wasting her money. And he is not parting with her in a good manner, because what he should have done, if he wanted to separate from her, is to give his wife her rights in full with regard to the mahr. But he harmed her and put pressure on her, and he withheld her rights from her – without her deserving any such treatment – until she ransoms herself from him. Allah, may He be exalted, has forbidden such reprehensible conduct in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse. And live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisa’ 4:19].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This talaaq that has been given by this husband is called a “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation”; it is a kind of khula‘, as was explained in fatwa no. 198920&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fuqaha’ differed as to the definition of a khula‘ or “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation”. According to the majority of fuqaha’, it is an irrevocable talaaq. Al-Khurashi al-Maaliki said: An irrevocable talaaq can only come about using words that signal khula‘, “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation”, ransom or talaaq with monetary payment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel by al-Khurashi, 4/17&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the rulings on talaaq in return for payment is that the husband does not have the right to take the wife back during the ‘iddah. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (22/108), when mentioning the conditions on taking the wife back:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fifth condition: that the talaaq should not be in return for compensation. If the talaaq is in return for compensation, then it is not valid to take the wife back, because in that case the talaaq is irrevocable, because the woman has ransomed herself from the husband by means of the financial compensation that she gave him, which ended this relationship, as in the case of khula‘ and talaaq in return for money. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A number of scholars are of the view that khula‘ – along with “talaaq in return for letting the husband off the mahr or some other obligation” – is an annulment of the marriage and not a talaaq. This is the more correct view, as we have explained in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/126444\">126444</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to this more correct view, what happened with this man is an annulment and is not a talaaq at all. Hence he has no right to take back the wife from whom he separated by khula‘ during the ‘iddah. If he wants to marry her again, then he may do so, with a new marriage contract and mahr, if she herself agrees to that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once it is proven that what happened comes under the heading of khula‘, then it does not matter whether it happened during menses or during a period of purity in which he had had intercourse with her, because the correct scholarly view is that there is nothing wrong with khula‘ during menses or during a period of purity in which intercourse took place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah (7/324): There is nothing wrong with khula‘ during menses or during a period of purity in which he had intercourse with her, because the prohibition on talaaq during menses is because of the harm that will affect her as a result of making the ‘iddah longer, whereas khula‘ is aimed at removing the harm that affects her because of the husband's bad treatment and staying with someone whom she dislikes, which is worse than the harm caused by extending the length of the ‘iddah. Hence it is permissible to ward off the greater harm by means of the lesser. For this reason the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask the woman who was separated by means of khula‘ about her condition. Moreover, the harm caused by extending the length of the ‘iddah affects her, whereas khula‘ occurs at her request, which signals that she approves of it and indicates that it is most likely in her best interests. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This issue has been discussed in detail in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/186809\">186809</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the mahr that was given up by the wife, she does not have the right to change her mind, because she gave it up by choice after the husband offered to give her a talaaq in return for giving up the mahr, and she agreed to that. She could have refused and referred the matter to the shar‘i judge (qaadi) to make him divorce her (talaaq) because of the harm she was suffering. In that case she could have gotten her rights in full.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the husband’s denial of this pregnancy and saying “I do not have a child from her,” this is reprehensible and is a false statement; there is a fear that he may come under the warning mentioned in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any man who denies his child whilst he is looking at him, will be obstructed from Allah, and Allah will disgrace him before all of creation, the first and the last of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2263; Ibn Maajah, 2743; classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah, 1427&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fuqaha’ (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that any child born to a woman six months or more after the marriage contract, when it is possible that intercourse may have taken place thereafter, is to be attributed to the husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle concerning that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The child is for the (owner of the) bed and the fornicator gets nothing.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “The child is for the (owner of the) bed”, what is meant is that if the man has a wife or a slave woman who has become his concubine, and she gives birth to a child within the timeframe during which it is feasible that it could be his child, the child is to be attributed to him and becomes his child; they may inherit from one another and all the other rulings stemming from birth are applicable to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 10/37&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what he has written, or even if she or her guardians wrote it, stating that he has no child from her, this is idle talk which is worthless and has no impact. If it so happened that he did not have a child from her at the time of writing, and her pregnancy was not known then, this does not mean that she did not bear him a child who was born after that, within the timeframe of feasibility, as mentioned above. It is not permissible for him to deny the child and it is not permissible either for her to conceal what Allah created in her womb from her husband, even if she hates him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Masturbation using the hand and otherwise is haram for both men and women, because of the evidence which you will find mentioned in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/329\" target=\"_blank\">329</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both spouses have the right to enjoy one another however they wish, so long as they avoid menstruation and the back passage.

Many husbands neglect the wife’s rights with regard to intimacy and fulfilment of desire, and this usually stems from ignorance about women’s nature and their differences from men with regard to this action. Speaking frankly, trying to deal with the matter and reading some books on this topic all play a major role in setting things straight, in sha Allah. If the woman has the habit of masturbating, that may make her lose interest in her husband and she may not feel any desire for intercourse, or it may not be enough to satisfy her.

      "question": "<p>My father divorced my mother irrevocably, and they cannot get back together. He subjected my mother to all kinds of injustice, humiliation, bad treatment and stinginess. He even betrayed her physically with more than one woman. <br />\n<br />\nThe point is that all of this mistreatment made my mother mentally ill and she could no longer bear to live with that. Now he has two houses, one in which my mother and her children live and the other in which he lives. The two houses are built of bricks and concrete without reinforcement, and the roofs are made of wood. The house in which we live with our mother was not built for us by him; rather it was built for us by some well-wishers five years after he left us and ran away, but he is threatening to sell it. Is it permissible for us, in order to protect our rights and our mother’s rights, to ask him to register this house in which we live, in return for our mother giving up to him things that she is entitled to, namely her mahr and the delayed portion of it, and the maintenance he is obliged to give her for the rest of her life, giving up all of that in return for him registering this house in which we live in our name?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is permissible for your father to put the house asked     about in your mother’s name and to make that a pure gift or to do it in     return for what she has of the mahr and the delayed portion, if applicable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    However some things must be borne in mind:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -1-</p>\n<p>    That your mother is no longer regarded as his wife, so if     your father has another wife, he is not obliged to treat them equally,     because she is no longer his wife.

If he does have other children,     then he has to treat them fairly in terms of giving, so if he gives     something to one of them, he has to give the others something similar.

      "title": "Some types of haraam transactions",
      "question": "<p>What are the types of haram transactions? Please quote the evidence for that.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There are many types of haram transactions, and it is not possible to list them all in this brief answer. On our website, in the section on haram transactions you will find many of these transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a useful principle concerning this matter, which will help one to understand the issue and by referring to it the issue will become clear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (29/22):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second principle concerning contracts, both halaal and haram: the basic principle in this regard is that Allah has forbidden us in His Book to eat up one another’s property unjustly (cf. 2:188); He condemned the rabbis and monks who ate up the people’s wealth unjustly; He condemned the Jews for consuming usury (riba) when they had been forbidden to do so, and for eating up the people’s wealth unjustly. This includes everything that is eaten up or consumed unjustly in transactions and donations, and whatever is taken without consent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eating up or consuming wealth unjustly in transactions is of two types, which Allah mentioned in His Book. They are usury (riba) and gambling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The prohibition on usury, which is the opposite of charity, is mentioned at the end of Soorat al-Baqarah, Soorat Aal ‘Imraan and ar-Room. The Jews are condemned for it in Soorat an-Nisa’, and the prohibition on gambling is mentioned in Soorat al-Maa’idah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained in detail that which Allah had mentioned in general terms in His Book. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade ambiguous transactions, as was narrated by Muslim and others from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). Ambiguous transactions are those of which the outcome is unknown, which leads to the same negative outcomes as gambling, namely enmity and resentment, in addition to consuming wealth unlawfully, which is a type of oppression or wrongdoing. Ambiguous transactions involve wrongdoing, enmity and resentment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for usury, the prohibition on it in the Qur’an is more emphatic. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers.</p>\n<p>And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger”&nbsp;[al-Baqarah 2:278-279].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) included it among the major sins, as was narrated in as-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). Allah stated that some good things that had been permitted to the Jews became forbidden to them because of their wrongdoing, their preventing people from following the path of Allah, and their consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. And He, may He be glorified and exalted, said that He will destroy riba (usury) as He gives increase for charity (cf. 2:276). Both matters are tried, tested and true in people’s experience. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the basic principle is that any transaction that includes either of these two forbidden matters – usury (riba) or gambling – or that is a trick to get around the prohibition on these two things, comes under the heading of haram transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of transactions that are haram because of usury (riba) include: ‘Eenah transaction [which means to sell something for a price to be paid at a later date, then to buy it back for a lower price to be paid immediately]; selling debts; combining a sale contract with a loan; and the like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of transactions that are haram because of gambling include: sales of unknown items; and sales of things that one cannot deliver.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/105339\">105339</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger.” [al-Tawbah 9:54]</p>\n<p>According to the hadith of Mu’adh, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent him to Yemen, he said: “You are going to people from among the people of the Book. Call them to bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers each day and night. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them charity (zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” (Agreed upon)</p>\n<p>So the disbeliever is commanded first of all to enter Islam. If he becomes Muslim, then we tell him to pray, give zakah, fast, perform Hajj and all the other duties of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Being_of_sound_mind_and_being_an_adultnbsp\"><b>Being of sound mind and being an adult&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pen is lifted from three [and does not record their deeds]: from one who is sleeping, until he wakes up; from a child until he reaches puberty, and from one who is insane until he comes to his senses.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4403; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So a child is not obliged to perform Hajj, but if his parents take him for Hajj, his Hajj is valid; the child will have the reward of Hajj and his parents will also have a reward. When a woman lifted up a child and asked, “Is there Hajj for this one?” the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, and you will have the reward.” (Narrated by Muslim)</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Being_freenbsp\"><b>Being free&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>Hajj is not obligatory for a slave, because he is distracted by his duties towards his master.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Being_able_to_do_itnbsp\"><b>Being able to do it&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Aal 'Imran 3:97]</p>\n<p>This includes being able both physically and financially.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by being physically able is that one is sound in body and can bear the hardship of travelling to the sacred House of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Meaning_of_financial_ability_in_Hajj\"><b>Meaning of financial ability in Hajj</b></span></h5>\n<p>Being financially able means that one has enough funds to get to the sacred House of Allah and back again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee said (11/30):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Being able to do Hajj means that one is sound in body and has means of transportation to reach the sacred House of Allah whether by plane, car or riding animal, or by renting such means, according to his situation, and that he has sufficient provisions to get there and back. That should be surplus to what he needs to spend on those on whom he is obliged to spend, until he returns from Hajj. A woman should also have a husband or mahram with whom to travel to Hajj or ‘Umrah.”</p>\n<p>The money that he uses to reach the sacred House should be surplus to his basic needs, the spending enjoined on him by Shari’ah, and what he needs to pay off his debts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by debts here is things that he owes to Allah, such as expiations, and what he owes to other people.</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Hajj_of_one_who_is_in_debt\"><b>Hajj of one who is in debt</b></span></h5>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36852\" target=\"_blank\">If a person has a debt</a> , and he does not have enough money to both do Hajj and pay off the debt, then he should pay off the debt first and he does not have to go for Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some people think that the reason is that he did not ask permission from the one to whom he owes the money, and that if he gives him permission, then there is nothing wrong with it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no basis for this thinking, rather the reason is being in debt. It is known that if the lender gives the debtor permission to go for Hajj, that does not mean the debt is waived, and he will not have discharged his duty because of this permission. Hence it should be said to the debtor: Pay off your debt first, then if you have enough left, go for Hajj; otherwise Hajj is not obligatory in your case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the debtor who did not go for Hajj because of his debt dies, then he will meet Allah with his Islam complete and not lacking, because Hajj was not obligatory for him, just as zakah and also Hajj are not obligatory for one who is poor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he does Hajj before paying off his debt and then dies before paying it off, then he is in danger, because even the martyr is forgiven for everything except debt, so what about anyone else?&nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Meaning_of_spending_enjoined_by_Sharirsquoah\"><b>Meaning of spending enjoined by Shari’ah</b></span></h5>\n<p>What is meant by the spending enjoined on him by Shari’ah is what he is obliged by shari’ah to spend on himself and his family, without being either extravagant or stingy. If he is of average means and wants to show signs of richness such as buying an expensive car so that he will look rich, and he does not have enough money to perform Hajj, then he has to sell the car and use that money to perform Hajj, and he should buy a car that suits his situation. His spending on this car is not a kind of spending that is approved of in shari’ah, rather it is extravagance, which is forbidden in Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by financially able is that he should have enough for his family until he returns, and he should have an income after he returns to take care of himself and those on whom he spends, such as rent from property, a salary and business earnings, etc. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence he does not have to use the capital of his business, the profit of which he spends on himself and his family, to do Hajj, if that loss of capital will result in a loss of profits which in turn will mean that his family does not have enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee (11/36) was asked about a man who has a sum of money in an Islamic bank and his income came from the profits on that money which gave him enough to live a moderate lifestyle. Is he obliged to do Hajj using that capital, knowing that this would affect his monthly income and stretch his finances unbearably?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If your situation is as you describe, you are not obliged to perform Hajj because you are not able to in the manner required by shari’ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Al 'Imran 3:97]</p>\n<p>And He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [al-Hajj 22:78]” &nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Meaning_of_basic_needs\"><b>Meaning of basic needs</b></span></h5>\n<p>What is meant by basic needs is what a person needs a great deal of in his life, and which it is too hard for him to do without, such as books for the seeker of knowledge. So we do not tell him: Sell your books and use the money to go for Hajj, because these are basic needs for him. Similarly if a person needs his car, we do not tell him, Sell it and use the money to go to Hajj. But if he has two cars and he does not need one of them, then he has to sell one of them and use the money to go to Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly, a craftsman does not need to sell his tools, because he needs them. And if a man has a car which he uses for work and spends on himself and his family from the money he earns for hiring it out, he does not have to sell it in order to go for Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another basic need is the need to get married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person needs to get married, that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27120\" target=\"_blank\">takes precedence over Hajj</a> , otherwise Hajj takes precedence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by being financially able is that a person should have surplus funds that are sufficient for doing Hajj after paying off debts and taking care of shar’i obligations and basic needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person is physically and financially able to do Hajj, then he is obliged to hasten to do Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is not physically and financially able, or if he is physically able but he is poor and has no wealth, then he is not obliged to do Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person is financially able but he is not physically able, then we look at the matter further.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If his problem is something that he hopes will disappear, such as a sickness from which he hopes to recover, then he should wait until Allah heals him, then do Hajj.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If his problem is one for which there is no hope that it will disappear, such as a person with cancer or an old person who cannot do Hajj, then he has to appoint someone to do Hajj on his behalf, and the duty to perform Hajj is not waived because of his physical inability if he is financially able. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1513) according to which a woman said: “O Messenger of Allah, Allah’s command to the people to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He said: “Yes.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed with her comment that Hajj was obligatory for her father even though he was physically unable to perform Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Can_women_go_to_Hajj_without_a_mahram\"><b>Can women go to Hajj without a mahram?</b></span></h4>\n<p>In order for Hajj to be obligatory for a woman, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/34380\" target=\"_blank\">it is essential for her to have a mahram with her</a> , and it is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj, whether that is an obligatory or nafl Hajj, without a mahram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a mahram.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1862; Muslim 1341)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mahram is her husband or one whom it is permanently forbidden for her to marry because of blood ties, breastfeeding or ties through marriage. The husband of a sister, maternal aunt or paternal aunt is not a mahram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some women take this matter lightly and travel with their sister and sister’s husband, or with a maternal aunt and the aunt’s husband, but this is haram, because the sister’s husband or the maternal aunt’s husband is not a mahram, so it is not permissible for her to travel with him. So there is the fear that her Hajj is not proper, for the proper Hajj (Hajj mabrur) is that which is not mixed with any sin, but this woman is sinning throughout her journey until she returns home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also essential that the mahram be an adult of sound mind, because the aim of the mahram is to protect the woman, and a child or one who is insane cannot do that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman does not have a mahram, or she has one but he is unable to travel with her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Should_the_wife_ask_for_her_husbandrsquos_permission_to_go_to_Hajjnbsp\"><b>Should the wife ask for her husband’s permission to go to Hajj?&nbsp;</b></span></h4>\n<p>The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/40525\">husband’s permission is not an essential condition</a> of it being obligatory for a woman to do Hajj, rather she is obliged to do Hajj when the conditions of it being obligatory are met, even if her husband does not give permission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee said (11/20):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The obligatory Hajj is obligatory when the conditions of being able to do it are met, and the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36595\" target=\"_blank\">husband’s permission</a> is not one of them. It is not permissible for him to forbid her, rather it is prescribed for him to cooperate with her in fulfilling this duty. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This has to do with the obligatory Hajj. As for nafl Hajj, Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that the scholars were unanimously agreed that a husband has the right to forbid his wife from doing a nafl Hajj, because the husband’s rights are binding upon her and are not superseded by something that is not obligatory for her.

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on exercising in a gym where there is music? Please note that I have advised those who are in charge but they did not act upon my advice. Now I have started to use an mp3 player whilst I am exercising.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to listen to music, whether in a gym or     elsewhere, because of a great deal of evidence which states that it is     haraam to listen to musical instruments. See the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/5000\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">5000</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fact that there is music in the gym is an evil which must     be denounced. It is not sufficient just to put on earphones to block the     sound or distract oneself by listening to something permissible. Rather if     denouncing it verbally does not work, there remains the option of denouncing     it in one’s heart, which can only be achieved by going away from the evil     and leaving the place where it is happening, so long as one is able to do     that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let him change it with     his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking     out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart – and that is the weakest of     faith.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Muslim (49).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fact that it is obligatory to leave the place where evil     is being committed is also indicated by the verse in which Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And it has     already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear     the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them,     until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them)     certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect     the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’     4:140]</p>\n<p>al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have     mercy on him) said: The words of Allaah, “then sit not with them, until     they engage in a talk other than that” mean, something other than kufr     (disbelief). “(But if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you     would be like them” – this indicates that it is obligatory to avoid     people of sin if they are openly committing evil, because the one who does     not avoid them is approving of their deeds, and approving of kufr is also     kufr. Allaah says “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case     you would be like them”, so everyone who sits in a gathering where sin     is committed and does not denounce them will share the burden of sin with     them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>They should be denounced if     they speak of sin or commit sin; if one cannot denounce them then he should     leave them so that he will not be one of those mentioned in this verse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Umar     ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez caught some people who were drinking alcohol, and it was     said to him that one of the people present was fasting. He had the     punishment carried out on him too, and he recited this verse: “(but if     you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them”,     i.e., approval of sin is also a sin. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Jassaas said in     Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (2/407): This verse indicates that it is obligatory to     denounce evil to the one who does it, and part of denouncing it is showing     one’s dislike of it if it is not possible to remove it, and not sitting with     the one who does it, and leaving him until he stops it and does something     else. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah     have mercy on him) said: Denouncing in one's heart is obligatory for     everyone, which means hating the evil and leaving the people if one is     unable to change it with one's words or actions, because Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And when you (Muhammad    صلى الله عليه وسلم) see those who engage     in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’aan) by mocking at     them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaytaan     (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the     company of those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)”</p>\n<p>[al-An’aam 6:68]</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Durar     al-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajwabah al-Najdiyyah (16/142).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    To sum up, you must denounce this evil and advise those who     are in charge of this gym. If they respond, then praise be to Allaah, and if     they do not respond then look for another gym, and do not share in the sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",
