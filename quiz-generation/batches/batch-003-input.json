      "title": "Selling goods when they are still on the ship or plane; who is liable for them if they are damaged or destroyed?",
      "question": "<p>Someone bought a shipload of rice, and before the cargo reached him and was received, he sold it to someone else. Then soon after that the ship sank. Is the transaction valid, and who is liable for the loss of the cargo? What about goods that are brought in from abroad, whether by plane or by ship – once the goods are no longer in the possession of the seller, after shipping, and there is documentation of the transaction between the two parties: isn’t that regarded as receipt of the goods? Or is it stipulated that goods should be received and taken away by the purchaser? Who is liable for the goods if they are damaged or destroyed in this case? What about selling goods that are already on board ships at sea, where they are at risk of accidents and destruction?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The sale transaction transfers ownership of the goods from the seller to the purchaser, but they remain the liability of the seller until the purchaser receives and takes possession of them.</p>\n<p>When the purchaser himself, or his agent, receives the goods and takes possession of them, and removes them from the seller’s warehouses, it becomes permissible for him to sell them, even if they are still on board a ship or plane, because by receiving them and moving them, they become his liability. For that reason, it becomes permissible for him to sell them and make a profit on them, whereas it is not permissible for him to do that before they become his liability, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade making a profit on an item for which you are not liable, and he (blessings and some of Allah be upon him) said: “Profit is connected to liability.”</p>\n<p>So if the agreement is that the seller’s responsibility ends as soon as the goods are delivered to the shipping company that the purchaser chooses, or that the seller recommends, then as soon as the goods leave the seller’s warehouse and are transported to the shipping company, whether they are being shipped by sea or by air, and the documents proving the sale are handed over, this is regarded as being like receipt of goods and more.</p>\n<p>Thus the goods become the liability of the purchaser, so if they are lost or damaged at sea or in the air, the purchaser is liable, because he took possession of them and moved them to the port, either by himself or through his agent.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Selling goods when they are on the ship or plane is a valid transaction, by means of which ownership is transferred.</p>\n<p>So if the merchant sells his goods when they are still on the ship, before they reach him, and they had become his liability, as noted above in the previous paragraph, then the transaction is valid. The new purchaser has the option of cancelling the deal if any defect becomes apparent or if the goods differ from the description given in the contract.</p>\n<p>If it so happens that the goods are damaged before they are received by the purchaser, the new purchaser is not liable for that, because the goods remain the liability of the seller until the purchaser receives them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Conclusion:</p>\n<p>If the purchaser/importer had received the goods (the rice) himself, and he himself shipped them, or asked his agent to receive the goods from the seller/supplier, even if the agent is the shipping company itself, and the goods are damaged or destroyed before they reach the place where the purchaser wanted them to go, then&nbsp; the purchaser is liable for that, because he received the goods in a real sense and was the one who disposed of them by shipping them himself.</p>\n<p>But if the seller/supplier is the one who shipped the goods himself, or his agent did that, or the transaction was done on board the ship, then the goods were destroyed before they were received by the purchaser, then the seller is liable for them.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Definition of a mursal hadeeth",
      "question": "<p>What is a mursal hadeeth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    A hadeeth is called a “mursal hadeeth” if the one who     narrated it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a     Taabi’i and not a Sahaabi. It is possible to differentiate between a Sahaabi     and a Taabi’i by referring to books of biography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Abu ‘Abd-Allah al-Haakim (may Allah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no difference of opinion among the shaykhs of     hadeeth that the mursal hadeeth is one which the muhaddith narrated with a     complete isnaad back to the Taabi’i, and the Taabi’i says, “The Messenger of     Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.” End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ma’rifah ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth, 67&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This name is given by consensus to the hadeeth of a senior     Taabi’i from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him), such as when ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Adiyy ibn al-Khayyaar, or Abu Umaamah     ibn Sahl ibn Haneef, or ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Aamir ibn Rabee’ah, and the like,     say: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     said…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The same applies to those who are lower in status than these,     such as Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab, Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd     al-Rahmaan, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, and others like them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The same applies to ‘Ilqimah ibn Qays, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda’,     al-Hasan, Ibn Sireen, al-Sha’bi, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, and others like them     among the rest of the Taabi’een who it has been proven met a number of the     Sahaabah and spent time with them. This is what is meant by mursal according     to the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also applies to reports narrated from Taabi’een of lower     status than those mentioned above, such as hadeeth narrated by Ibn Shihaab,     Qataadah, Abu Haazim and Yahya ibn Sa’eed from the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him), which they call mursal, like the mursal reports     of the senior Taabi’een. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is essential to point out that the muhadditheen --     especially the earlier ones among them -- called every report that had an     interruption in its isnaad a mursal report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Mursal refers to a report whose isnaad (chain of     transmission) is interrupted, meaning that among its narrators is one who     did not hear it from the one whose name comes before his. But in most cases,     what is described as mursal is that which was narrated by the Taabi’i from     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Kifaayah, p. 21.       </p>\n",

      "title": "He is\r\n    suffering a relapse after he repented",
      "question": "<p>I was brought up in a good Muslim household<br />\n      in the West. Unfortunately in my teenage years I allowed myself to be led astray by<br />\n      Shaitaan and committed many mortal sins for a number of years, even going out of Islam. I<br />\n      have tried to repent and reform over the last couple of years. I perform all the five<br />\n      pillars, give sadaqa generously, get involved with dawah and try to be helpful to Muslims.<br />\n      I am good to my wife and parents. <br />However my heart is very shaky indeed. Sometimes I am convinced of the<br />\n      truth but usually I am \"sumum bukmun\". I find that my heart is very arrogant,<br />\n      evil and hates the Truth. I have tried hard to repress these negative feelings but cannot<br />\n      fully overcome them. I want to become a Muslim again but am at the point of resigning<br />\n      myself to a life of Taaghoot. I have read countless books and been to many lectures but I<br />\n      have made no progress. I want to succeed in this life and be saved from the Fire. What can<br />\n      I do? Do I need to do the Shahada again? <br /> Please help me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>His Excellence Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the following question:</p>\n<p>I am a young man who has wronged myself by committing many sins. I do    not even pray in the mosque, I have never fasted all of Ramadaan in my life, and I do    other bad things. Often I have promised myself that I will repent, but then I go back to    my bad ways. I make friends with young people in our neighbourhood who are not very good,    and most of my brothers’ friends who come to our house are also not righteous. Allaah    knows that I have wronged myself by committing so many sins and doing bad things, but    every time I resolve to repent, I go back to my old ways again. I hope that you can show    me a way to get closer to my Lord and keep me from doing these bad things.</p>\n<p>He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:</p>\n<p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed    against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of    Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”    [al-Zumar 39:54] </p>\n<p>The scholars agreed that this aayah was revealed concerning those who    repent; whoever repents sincerely from his sins, Allaah will forgive him all his sins, as    this aayah says, and as Allaah says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Turn to Allaah with sincere repentance! It    may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under    which rivers flow (Paradise)” [al-Tahreem 66:8]</p>\n<p>In this aayah, Allaah made the forgiveness of sins and admittance to    Paradise conditional upon sincere repentance, which includes giving up and avoiding sins,    regretting the sins of the past, and sincerely resolving not to go back to them, out of    reverence for Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.</p>\n<p>One of the conditions of sincere repentance is that one should restore    what is rightfully due to people whom you have wronged or asking for their forgiveness if    the sin involved wronging them with regard to blood, wealth or honour. If it is not    possible to ask your brother for forgiveness concerning his honour, then you must pray for    him a lot, and speak of him in the best way you can in the places where you gossiped about    him, for good deeds expiate for bad deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“… And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O    believers, that you may be successful.” [al-Noor 24:31]. In this aayah, Allaah    made the connection between success and tawbah, which indicates that the one who repents    will be successful and blessed. If the one who repents follows his repentance with faith    and righteous deeds, Allaah will wipe out his sayi’aat (evil deeds) and    replace them with hasanaat (good deeds). Allaah says in Soorat al-Furqaan,    after mentioning shirk, killing without just cause and zina (unlawful sexual    intercourse) (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection,    and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good    deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:69-70]</p>\n<p>One of the means of repentance is praying to Allaah for guidance and    strength, asking Him to bless you with repentance. Allaah is the One Who says    (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My    Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your    (invocation)…” [Ghaafir 40:60]</p>\n<p>And He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then    (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of    the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor).”    [al-Baqarah 2:186]</p>\n<p>Another of the means of repentance which will help you adhere to it is    keeping company with good people and following their example of righteous conduct, and    keeping away from bad company. It was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“A man will be on the path of his close friends, so pay attention    to who you make friends with.”</p>\n<p>And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“The likeness of a righteous companion is that of the seller of    musk: either he will give you a gift, or you will buy something from him, or you will    smell a pleasant fragrance from him. And the likeness of an evil companion is that of the    man who works the bellows: either he will burn your garment, or you will smell an    unpleasant odour from him.” </p>\n<p>(Majmoo’ Fataawaa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez    ibn Baaz; Fataawaa al-‘Aqeedah, part 2, p. 640)</p>\n<p>With regard to renewing your Islam: if you have done something that    takes you out of Islam altogether, then you have to pronounce the Shahaadatayn and    re-enter Islam because you had left it. If what you have done is a major sin which does    not, however, take you out of Islam, then it is sufficient for you to repent according to    the conditions referred to above. Do not despair of the Mercy of Allaah; follow the path    of salvation. May Allaah give us and you the strength to do all that is good. May Allaah    bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to bless us and you with sincere repentance and to forgive    us and you. May He show you the way out from your problem and bring us and you together in    Gardens of Delight (Paradise) facing one another on thrones [cf. Al-Hijr 15:47]. Ameen.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is the concept of the Christian Trinity that the Quran declares to be false?",
      "question": "<p>In various places in the quran the christians are condemned for saying that Allah is the third of three (surat an nisa 4:171 and surat al Maida 5:73 for example ). When I read the verses I assumed that they referred to the christian trinity (father, son, holy spirit), but the tafsir of ibn kathir states that what is meant here is that christians claimed that Allah was a third with Isa (alleihi salaam) and Maryam. Is this correct? If so, is this referrring to a specific group/sect? (as is the case with the jews claiming Uzair is the son of Allah) Is the trinity of mainstream christianity dealt with directly in the quran and the sunnah, or is no mention of it made? I know the divinity of Isa ( alleihi salaam) is dealt with, but is there anything concerning the supposed holy spirit?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’ But there is no llaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God -Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:73].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The correct view is that this was revealed concerning the Christians in particular, as was stated by Mujaahid and others.</p>\n<p>Then the scholars differed concerning that. It was said that what is meant by that is their disbelief (kufr) because they say that there are three hypostases (“persons” of the trinity), namely the hypostasis of the Father, the hypostasis of the Son and the hypostasis of the Word that was transmitted from the Father to the Son – exalted be Allah far above what they say.</p>\n<p>As-Suddi and others said: This was revealed concerning their making the Messiah and his mother into two gods with Allah, thus making Allah the third of three, according to this concept. As-Suddi said: This is like what Allah, may He be exalted, says at the end of the soorah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): \"O 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?'\" He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:116].</p>\n<p>This view is the one that is more likely to be correct. And Allah knows best.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer&nbsp; 3/158).</p>\n<p>This interpretation which was favoured by Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) is the one that is more likely to be correct, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>-1-&nbsp;Ibn Katheer quoted, as further evidence, some reports from the righteous early generations, in which they follow the methodology of interpreting some parts of the Quran by means of other parts, which is one of the best and most appropriate ways of interpreting the Holy Quran.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If someone were to ask: What are the best ways of interpreting the Quran? The answer is: The soundest way is to interpret the Quran by means of the Quran, because what is discussed in general terms in one place is explained elsewhere, and what is mentioned in brief in one place is mentioned in more detail elsewhere.\"(Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (13/363).</p>\n<p>The early generations thought that the words “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)” are explained by the words of Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?”’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours, truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).</p>\n<p>‘Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things’”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:116-117].</p>\n<p>-2-&nbsp;This interpretation is supported by what follows the verse, confirming that Maryam (Mary – peace be upon her) is not divine, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: \"Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).\" But there is no llaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God -Allah)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:73].</p>\n<p>Then after that come the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The Messiah ['Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the words of Allah and His Books]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allah does not eat). Look how We make the Ayât (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them, yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:75].</p>\n<p>This verse confirms that Maryam (Mary – peace be upon her) is not divine, on two counts:</p>\n<p>(i) Her status is that of siddeeqiyyah (being strong and true in faith), which is a status of servitude to Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>(ii) She used to eat food, which is the description of a created being who has needs; it is not the description of God Who is independent of means and has no need of His creation.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to what the Quran says about what the Christians said, “Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)”, the commentators said that it refers to Allah, the Messiah and his mother, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that He will say (interpretation of the meaning): “‘O 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?”’” [al-Maa’idah 5:116]. Hence in the context of this passage He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The Messiah ['Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the words of Allah and His Books]”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:75].</p>\n<p>The most that the Messiah can be is a Messenger, and the most that his mother can be is a siddeeqah; they could never reach the level of divinity. The one proves the other (that is, the fact that they are no more than that is proof that the Messiah is not God), and this is quite clear.\"(Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa&nbsp; 2/444).</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words “They both used to eat food” mean: they both needed to be nourished by food, and to expel the resulting waste products. So they were two slaves of Allah, like all other people, and they were not gods as the ignorant Christians claim.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer&nbsp; 3/159).</p>\n<p>-3-&nbsp;The revelation came to expose misguidance and disbelief, and to explain the way of guidance. It did not come to rectify the terminology used by the disbelievers. The concept of Trinity in which the Christians believe, regardless of their various interpretations thereof, in reality boils down to exaggeration about ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and his mother. Therefore the Quran dealt with and refuted this basic concept, and struck at the roots of the idea of Trinity, refuting the blasphemous idea that is common to all of their groups. Therefore we may say that the view that this verse was revealed to criticise their taking the Messiah and his mother as two gods besides Allah, may He be exalted, is not contrary to the reality of the Christians; rather it is highlighting the true essence of their blasphemy, that is common to all of their groups.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the context of discussing the verses that refute the blasphemy of the Christians:</p>\n<p>The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “The Messiah ['Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him” [al-Maa’idah 5:75] come after the words “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)’” [al-Maa’idah 5:73], which indicates that the trinity that Allah says they believe in involves regarding the Messiah son of Maryam and his mother as two gods.</p>\n<p>This is clear, on the basis that what is narrated from the Christians is that they believe that the divine descended upon Mary and was incarnated in the Messiah. This is in accordance with their beliefs.</p>\n<p>Based on that, every verse in which Allah mentions their views refers to all of their groups and refers to their belief in the Trinity and the notions of the divine descending upon Mary and being incarnated in the Messiah. Thus it includes all types of Christians and all types of their blasphemy. It is not the case that every verse that speaks of them is speaking of one type, as some have suggested, and there is not one verse that speaks about the Trinity and another that speaks about the descent of the divine and incarnation. Rather Allah, may He be glorified, mentions, in every single verse referred to, the blasphemy this is common to all of them, but He describes their blasphemy is being threefold, each aspect of which implies the other two: they say that the Messiah is God, and they say that he is the son of God, and they say that God is the third of three, as they took their Messiah and his mother as gods besides the true God, one on the basis of the divine descending upon her and the other on the basis of the divine being incarnated in him. Thus it becomes clear that they believe in three gods in one. This covers all the blasphemous concepts of the Christians.\"(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra&nbsp; 6/589-590).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, (\"Be!\" - and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh)[] created by Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allah is (the only) One Ilaah (God), glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs”[an-Nisa’ 4:171].</p>\n<p>With regard to the words “Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’”, the word translated here as three is the subject of a hidden predicate, and any word may be assumed to be the predicate that refers to the Trinity of the Christians. Hence the scholarly views vary in trying to determine what the omitted predicate could be.</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is “Say not” that our gods are three. This was narrated from az-Zajjaaj.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas said: This refers to the Trinity: Allah, may He be exalted, and His wife and His son.</p>\n<p>Al-Farraa’ and Abu ‘Ubayd said: This means: do not say they are three…</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Ali said: The meaning implies: Do not say that He is the third of three… The Christians of all sects are unanimously agreed on the Trinity.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi&nbsp; 7/233).</p>\n<p>Therefore this verse refers to all types of Christian belief in the Trinity.</p>\n<p>At-Taahir Ibn ‘Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The audience addressed by the words “Say not” is the Christians in particular.</p>\n<p>The word “three” is the subject of a hidden predicate. The reason why it was omitted is so that the phrase will be fit to refer to all the ideas that they have of the Trinity, for the Christians varied with regard to the concept of the divine trinity, as we shall see below. Therefore we could figure out what the hidden predicate is, according to their various views regarding the nature of the Trinity, which could be described by the number three.</p>\n<p>The Trinity is fundamental to the belief of all Christians, but they differ concerning its precise nature.\"(At-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer&nbsp; 6/54)</p>\n<p>If you interpret it on the basis of the report that al-Qurtubi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), that what is meant by the Trinity is Allah, may He be exalted, and His wife and His son, then this interpretation is supported by the verses mentioned above in the first point.</p>\n<p>According to this view, this verse forbids the Christians to exaggerate about ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and his mother, which is the basis of the belief in Trinity that is common among them. Declaring their exaggeration to be false is declaring their belief in the Trinity to be false too.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Although what is well-known about the Christians is that they do not regard Mary (peace be upon her as one of the three hypostases (persons of the trinity) in which they believe, this does not rule out the fact that they regard her as a sort of god (or goddess).</p>\n<p>Taking Mary as a goddess means either clearly stating that she is divine, which was a belief attributed to some ancient Christian groups, or what we see of the Christian practice that is widespread among them of devoting some acts of worship to her, such as praying to her, seeking her help, and prostrating to her image. Whoever worships a thing has taken it as a god, even if he does not clearly state that.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Mary is mentioned alongside the Messiah, because some Christians took her as another god and worshipped her as they worshipped the Messiah. As for those who do not believe in that, they still ask of her what should be asked of God, to the extent that they say to her: Forgive me, have mercy on me, and so on, based on a belief that she will intercede with her son concerning that.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they say: O mother of God, intercede for us with God. And sometimes they ask her for their needs, which should be sought from God, and they do not mention intercession. Others worship her as they worshipped the Messiah.</p>\n<p>Sa‘eed ibn al-Batreeq spoke of them doing this, when he mentioned the Councils of Constantinople and Nicaea. He said:</p>\n<p>They held different views and different beliefs. Some of them said that the Messiah and his mother were two gods besides Allah; they were the Marianists.\"(Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh&nbsp; 4/255-256).</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The phrase “Holy Spirit” (Rooh al-Qudus) appears in the texts of revelation; what it refers to is Jibreel (Gabriel – peace be upon him).</p>\n<p>For example, it is seen in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Qur'an) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the Faith of) those who believe and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to Allah as Muslims)”&nbsp;[an-Nahl 16:102].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Holy Spirit is Jibreel. What is meant is a spirit that is sanctified, i.e., pure and free of anything that is not befitting.</p>\n<p>This meaning is referred to in many verses, such as (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's Permission’” [al-Baqarah 2:97].\"(Adwa’ al-Bayaan&nbsp; 3/442).</p>\n<p>At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Allah called Jibreel a “spirit” and described him as “holy” because Allah gave him a spirit created by Him, without needing a father to father him. Because of that, He called him a spirit and described him as holy. Holy means pure. By the same token, ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary) was called “a spirit created by Allah”, because Allah gave him a spirit created by Him, without needing a father to father him. We have explained previously in this book of ours that what is meant by being holy is being pure, so the one who is holy is pure and free of that.\"(Tafseer at-Tabari&nbsp; 2/224)</p>\n<p>In the books of the Christians, concerning the story of Maryam’s conception of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), it says that it happened by means of the Holy Spirit. This is in accordance with what our religion teaches, that Allah sent an angel to her, namely Jibreel, and he breathed into her and she conceived ‘Eesa (peace be upon him).</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And mention in the Book (the Quran, O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.</p>\n<p>She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Rooh [angel Jibreel (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.</p>\n<p>She said: ‘Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.’</p>\n<p>(The angel) said: ‘I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son’”&nbsp;[Maryam 19:16-19].</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Christians say in their creed (profession of faith) that the Messiah “was incarnate by the Holy Ghost [Spirit] of the Virgin Mary.” This is in accordance with what Allah says, that He sent His spirit, namely Jibreel, who is the Holy Spirit; he breathed into Maryam (Mary), and she conceived the Messiah. So the Messiah was a created, incarnate being created from his mother and from that spirit, and that spirit has nothing to do with the attributes of Allah or His life or anything else. Rather the Holy Spirit is mentioned frequently in the words of the Prophets, and what is meant by these words is either the angel or what Allah creates in the hearts of His Prophets and close friends (awliya’) of guidance, steadfastness and so on.\"(Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh&nbsp; 2/186).</p>\n<p>But in the process of distorting their religion, the Christians thought that they could not prove that ‘Eesa is the son of God, – exalted be He far above that – except by interpreting the Holy Spirit that Allah sent to Maryam as referring to an attribute of God that exists in Him, and is the Giver of life.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>They had a third council, fifty-eight years after the first Council of Nicaea. The emperor’s advisers and courtiers met with him and told him that the people’s beliefs had become corrupted and been influenced by the views of Arius and Macedonius, so he should write to all the bishops and patriarchs, instructing them to convene a meeting and explain the religion of Christianity. So the Emperor wrote to all the regions, and one hundred and fifty bishops gathered in Constantinople, where they examined and discussed the views of Arius, and found that his view stated that the Holy Spirit was a created being, not divine.</p>\n<p>But the Patriarch of Alexandria said: In our view, the Holy Spirit is nothing but the spirit of God, and the spirit of God is nothing but His life. If we say that the Holy Spirit is created, then we are saying that God’s life is created, and if we say that His life is created, then we are implying that He is not alive, and that is blasphemy.</p>\n<p>They all cursed whoever holds such a belief… And they stated that the Holy Spirit is a creator and not created, “very God from very God”, from the same essence as the Father and the Son, one essence and one nature.\"(Hidaayat al-Hayaara&nbsp; p. 410).</p>\n<p>They covered up this distortion and misguidance of theirs by playing with words that are mentioned in their Scriptures as being the words of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him).</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This is how it is according to the People of the Book, that Jesus “was incarnate by the Holy Ghost [Spirit] of the Virgin Mary”, but their misguidance is based on their misunderstanding, when they said that the Holy Spirit was the life of God, and a God that creates, grants provision and is worshipped. But there is nothing in the divinely-revealed Books or in the words of the Prophets to suggest that Allah described an attribute that is part of His Essence as the Holy Spirit, or that He described His word or any of His attributes as a son. This is one of the things that proves that the Christians are misguided and that they distorted the words of the Prophets and interpreted them in a manner different from the meaning intended by the Prophets.</p>\n<p>The origin of their concept of the Trinity is based on what is mentioned in one of the Gospels, that the Messiah (peace be upon him) said to them: “Baptise all people in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.”</p>\n<p>It may be said to them: If the Messiah really said that, there is nothing in the language of the Messiah or the language of any of the Prophets that they described an attribute of Allah that is part of His Essence – neither His word nor His life – as His son or as the Holy Spirit. They did not call His word His son and they did not describe God Himself as a son or Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>As that is the case, then this may explain that what is meant by son is not the eternal Word of Allah, which they say was begotten of God, even if it is eternal, and what is meant by the Holy Spirit is not the life of God. Rather what is meant by the son is the human Messiah and what is meant by the Holy Spirit is what came down to him of revelation and the angel who brought it down. Thus the Messiah would have enjoined them to believe in Allah and His Messenger, and in what He revealed to His Messenger and in the angel who brought it down. This was enjoined upon all the Prophets.\"(Al-Jawaab as-Saheeh&nbsp; 2/152-153].</p>\n<p>From the above it becomes clear that the Christian belief in the third hypostasis (person of the trinity), the Holy Spirit, is not an independent issue; rather it is an issue that is connected to their belief in Jesus being the son of God – exalted be He above that. Therefore proving false the belief that he is the son of God will lead to annulling their belief in the third person of the Trinity.</p>\n<p>Hence the texts of revelation which state that Allah is One and unique, He begets not nor is He begotten, and all the texts which declare false the belief in Trinity and the divinity of Jesus (peace be upon him) – all of these texts are sufficient to refute the belief in the hypostasis of the Holy Spirit as held by the Christians. Perhaps this is the reason why the revelation did not discuss the issue of the Holy Spirit separately.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on doing essential repairs to houses using zakaah money",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to give the zakaah on gold to a poor woman to do some essential repairs to her house?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If someone needs to do some essential repairs to his house, and does not have enough money to do that, it is permissible to give him zakaah funds for this purpose, subject to two conditions:</p>\n<p>1.. That the house actually needs those repairs, such as if there is the fear of a wall collapsing, or water leaking through the roof, and so on, and it is not solely for cosmetic purposes which one can do without.</p>\n<p>2.. That the repairs should be appropriate to the situation of this poor person, without spending extravagantly.</p>\n<p>The guideline in this case is that shelter is a basic need, and leaving the house without doing essential repairs when needed is undermining the basic benefit of the house in a way that may lead to the loss of that benefit altogether. Hence it is permissible to give zakaah to the poor person in order to make sure that this essential need is met properly and maintained.</p>\n<p>Even though we stated that a house should not be built for the poor person with zakaah funds, as noted in the answer to question no. 111884, essential repairs are a different matter, because there is a real need for them, and because it will not consume as much of the zakaah funds as construction of a new house would.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars regard it as permissible to buy or build a house for a poor person with zakaah funds.</p>\n<p>Imam Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that he did not see anything wrong with giving a man some of his zakaah so that he could go for Hajj or ransom himself from slavery.</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Ubayd said: And the minimum price for freeing a slave is more than two hundred dirhams.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas granted a concession stating that the entire amount for freeing one person may be taken from zakaah, even though one of the fuqaha’ did not accept this view, and he did not regard it as makrooh because of the high cost; rather he regarded it as makrooh because after manumitting the slave, the one who does that will have the connection of wala’ [and its advantages] with the former slave. But the views of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are more deserving of being followed.</p>\n<p>All these reports indicate that with regard to the amount of zakaah that is given to those in need, it is not limited to a particular time such that the Muslims cannot give it at any other time, and that it may be given even if the recipient is not in debt. In fact it may be given to someone out of compassion, by way of seeking reward, if that is the motive of the giver, without showing favouritism or being influenced by whims and desires, such as the case of a man who sees a household of righteous Muslims who are poor and needy, and he has a great deal of wealth, and these people have no house to shelter them and meet their needs, so he uses the zakaah of his wealth to buy a house for them to protect them from the cold of winter and the heat of the sun; or they are naked and do not have sufficient clothing, so he buys them clothes sufficient to cover their ‘awrah when praying and to protect them from heat and cold; or he sees a slave who has a bad master who is abusing and mistreating him, so he rescues him from slavery by buying him and then manumitting him; or he meets a wayfarer who is far from home and is cut off, so he gives him a mount so that he can reach his homeland and his family, either hiring it or buying it for him. In these and similar situations, that cannot be addressed except by spending a great deal of money, where the giver does not want to do it as an act of general charity, so he does it using the zakaah on his wealth – if he does that, wouldn’t he have fulfilled his duty and wouldn’t his zakaah be valid?</p>\n<p>Indeed it would, and he is a doer of good.</p>\n<p>I am worried, in the case of scholars who disapprove of the action of such a person because he does not want to give it as something voluntary [rather he wants to give it as zakaah], that this may mean that such scholars are preventing him, by means of such a verdict, from carrying out the obligatory duty of zakaah, and thus the people’s right to zakaah will be neglected and the poor will suffer.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>al-Amwaal</em> (p. 677).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) realized that I felt too shy so he went on his way. Then I came to al-Zubayr and told him that I had met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) carrying the date-stones on my head, and there was a group of his companions with him, and he had made his camel kneel so that I could ride behind him, but I had felt too shy and I remember his (al-Zubayr’s) protective jealousy. He said: “By Allah, for you to have to carry the date-stones is harder for me to bear than your riding with him.” She said: Then later on Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse and it was as if I had been set free from slavery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth of the woman from Ghifaar was narrated by Abu Dawood (313) from that woman of Banu Ghifaar who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) let me ride behind him on the back of his camel-saddle. This was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is not one of the issues on which the scholars are unanimously agreed, rather some of them clearly stated that there was a difference of scholarly opinion on this point. Al-‘Iraaqi said in Tarh al-Tathreeb (5/167), concerning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entering upon Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr: He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon Dubaa’ah to visit her when she was sick or to visit her because she was his relative as stated above. This points to his humility, upholding of kinship ties and concern for his relatives. It is to be interpreted as meaning that he was not alone with a woman in this case, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not sit alone with non-mahram women or shake hands with them. If he did do that then this does not mean that his infallibility was tarnished thereby, but they did not regard that as being one of his unique characteristics, thus he is like others with regard to this issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The author wrote it to give evidence, falsely, that it is Islamically prescribed to celebrate the Prophet’s birthday and to exaggerate about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and to seek his help and ask of him – and other Prophets and righteous people – besides Allah. Hence it is full of falsehoods, fabricated Hadiths and strange stories. If we were to examine it and critique it, it would take a very long time. Almost every single line of it requires some comment and refutation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among these lies and fabrications is what he (falsely) attributes to Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), saying that he used to seek the help of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and ask him besides Allah, saying:</p>\n<p>“O Master of masters, I have come to you, hoping that you will be pleased with me and will offer me your protection.</p>\n<p>By Allah, O Best of creation, I have a heart that is longing for you and does not want anyone but you.</p>\n<p>By your virtue, I am in love with you, and Allah knows how much I love you.</p>\n<p>O you who are the best of the two races (mankind and the jinn), bestow on me your generosity; I am happy if you are pleased with me.</p>\n<p>I am hoping for your generosity, as Abu Hanifah has no one else in this world but you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then he says that Imam Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“The family of the Prophet are my means to reach Him and they would lead me to Him.</p>\n<p>I hope by virtue of them that I will be given my record in my right hand on the Day of Resurrection.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is undoubtedly a lie about these two great imams who affirmed the Oneness of Allah. Otherwise, let him prove that from them with sound chains of narration going back to them, or even a weak chain of narration via which such a report could be transmitted. But they can never do that!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The polytheistic material narrated in this book includes the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It should be noted that seeking help from the beloved ones of Allah, may He be Exalted, such as the Prophets, the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8928\" target=\"_blank\">Awliya’ (close friends of Allah)</a> and the righteous is permissible during their lifetimes and after their deaths…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“… Thus it is known that it is permissible to seek help by saying `O Messenger of Allah, help me’ or `O Ghawth (source of help), O Muhiy Ad-Din `Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jilani and so on.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another example of this polytheistic material that is contained in this book is that which is mentioned by the questioner, “artakabtu Al-khataya, laka ashku ya sidi ya khayr an-nabiyyin (I have committed sins, I complain to you, O my master, O best of the Prophets).”</p>\n<p>This comes under the heading of major polytheism, because repentance from sins can only be to Allah alone, and complaining about the consequences of sins and their impact can only be done to Allah alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no. 179363, we explained that the words (interpretation of the meaning): {If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)…} [An-Nisa’ 4:64] were applicable only during the lifetime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and not after his death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This verse encouraged the Ummah to come to him if they had been unjust to themselves (or wronged themselves) by committing sin or falling into that which was more serious than that, namely Shirk. They were to come to him, repentant and regretting what they had done, so that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could pray for forgiveness for them. What was meant by that coming was coming to him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was still alive. Coming to him after his death for this purpose is not permissible. The evidence for that is the fact that the Companions and those who had deep knowledge of Islam did not do that, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not have the power to do that after he died.” (End quote from <em>Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz</em>, 6/189-190)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_ask_the_Prophet_for_help\">Can you ask the Prophet for help?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111019\" target=\"_blank\">Calling upon the Prophet</a> (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and asking of him besides Allah, and seeking his help, is a major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam, so how about seeking the help of anyone other than him?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21524\" target=\"_blank\">Calling upon the Prophet</a> (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking his help after his death to meet one’s needs or relieve one of distress is major Shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam.” (End quote from <em>Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah</em>, 1/473)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114142\" target=\"_blank\">Calling upon the Prophet</a> (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or any lesser person is Shirk and misguidance, because these people cannot respond. What one must do is repent to Allah from this Shirk and not call upon anyone except Allah. We all know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) himself did not possess any power to bring benefit or cause harm, except by the will of Allah. Allah, may He be Exalted, instructed him to declare that to his Ummah, as Allah said to him (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.} [Al-A`raf 7:188]</p>\n<p>{Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): `I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration’.} [Al-An`am 6:50]</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11402\" target=\"_blank\">The Messenger himself used to pray to Allah</a> , may He be Glorified, seeking forgiveness and mercy for himself, and for his companions. If he had been able to grant forgiveness to anyone or bestow mercy on him, he would not have needed to pray to Allah, may He be Glorified, for that. But all of creation is in need of Allah, and it is Allah alone Who is Free of all wants and needs, Worthy of all praise, as He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise} [Fatir 35:15]. Were it not for the devils toying with the minds of these people they would realise that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and others do not possess any power to benefit or harm anyone, and they would call upon Allah alone, with no partner or associate: {Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allah?} [An-Naml 27:62]” (End quote from <em>Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Al-`Uthaymin</em>, 21/218-219)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The point is that complaining about one’s situation and one’s sin, admitting it and repenting from it to any human being, or seeking help and aid from him, comes under the heading of Shirk or ascribing partners to Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. Indeed it comes under the heading of pure acts of worship which it is not permissible to devote to any except Allah, may He be Exalted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Sahih Muslim (2577) it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, narrating from his Lord, may He be blessed and Exalted: “ `O My slaves, all of you are astray except those whom I guide, so ask Me for guidance, and I will guide you. O My slaves, all of you are hungry except those whom I feed, so ask me for food and I will feed you. O My slaves, all of you are naked except those whom I clothe, so ask Me for clothing and I will clothe you. O My slaves, you err night and day, but I forgive all sins, so ask Me for forgiveness and I will forgive you.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to that which no one but Allah, may He be Exalted, is able to do, it is not permissible to seek it from anyone except Allah, may He be Glorified; it should not be sought from the angels or from the Prophets or from anyone else. It is not permissible to say to anyone other than Allah: `Forgive me’ or `Grant us rain or `Grant us victory over the disbelieving people’ or `Guide our hearts’ and so on. Hence At-Tabarani narrated in his Majma` that at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was a hypocrite who used to annoy the believers, so they said: Let us go and seek the help of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) against this hypocrite. So they came to him and he said: “Help should not be sought from me; rather it should be sought from Allah.” (End quote from <em>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</em>, 1/329)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

We will give you this advice and this <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/76010\" target=\"_blank\">etiquette for seeking knowledge</a> ; may Allah cause you to benefit thereby.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"1_ndash_Patience\"><strong>1 – Patience</strong></span></h4>\n<p>My dear brother, seeking knowledge is one of the highest of pursuits, and heights cannot be scaled except by working hard and striving. Abu Tamaam said, addressing himself:</p>\n<p>“Let me scale the heights that cannot be scaled, for reaching high things is difficult whilst reaching low things is easy.</p>\n<p>You want to scale the heights without any effort, but honey cannot be gathered without bee stings.”</p>\n<p>Another poet said:</p>\n<p>“You seek to attain glory, and those who seek to attain glory</p>\n<p>Strive their utmost and roll up their sleeves for that purpose.</p>\n<p>They strive hard but most of them become tired.</p>\n<p>But those who have patience and perseverance attain the heights of the glory that they desired.</p>\n<p>Do not think that attaining glory is as easy as eating dates;</p>\n<p>You cannot attain glory until you swallow the bitterest medicine.”</p>\n<p>So be patient and persevere. If jihaad requires an hour of patience, then the seeker of knowledge must be patient until the end of his life. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning)</p>\n<p><strong>“O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allâh, so that you may be successful.” </strong>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:200]</p>\n<h4><span id=\"2_ndash_Purity_of_intention_in_action\"><strong>2 – Purity of intention in action</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Adhere to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/240287\" target=\"_blank\">purity of intention</a> in what you do. Let your aim be to seek the Face of Allah (i.e., the pleasure of Allah) and the Home of the Hereafter. Beware of showing off and the love of making oneself appear to be superior to one’s peers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks knowledge in order to compete with the scholars or to prove himself superior to the ignorant or to make the people look up to him, Allah will cause him to enter Hell.” (narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2654; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i).</p>\n<p>To sum up, you have to be pure both outwardly and inwardly from every major and minor sin.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"3_ndash_Acting_upon_what_you_know\"><strong>3 – Acting upon what you know</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Know that acting upon what you know is the fruit of knowledge. Whoever knows but does not act upon his knowledge is like the Jews whom Allah likened to the ugliest things in His Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><strong>“The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Tawraat (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, disbelievers)” </strong>[al-Jumu’ah 62:5]</p>\n<p>And whoever acts without knowledge is like the Christians, who are the “daalleen (those who have gone astray)” mentioned in Soorat al-Faatihah. With regard to the books which you should study, they are mentioned in Question # <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20191\" target=\"_blank\">20191</a> ; please refer to this Question as it is important.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"4_ndash_Always_being_aware_that_Allah_is_watching\"><strong>4 – Always being aware that Allah is watching</strong></span></h4>\n<p>You must always be aware that Allah is watching you, in secret and in the open. Your attitude towards your Lord must always be balanced between fear and hope, which for the Muslims are like the two wings of a bird. Turn to Allah wholeheartedly and let your heart be filled with love for Him, your tongue with remembrance of Him (dhikr). Be happy and rejoice in His rulings and His wisdom.</p>\n<p>Always call upon Allah (du’aa’) in every sujood, asking Him to bless you and grant you beneficial knowledge, for if you are sincere towards Allah, He will support you and help you, and will cause you to attain the level of the righteous scholars.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"5_ndash_Make_the_best_use_of_time\"><strong>5 – Make the best use of time</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Make the most of your youth and your whole life by learning. Do not be deceived by procrastination and wishful thinking about the future. Every hour of your life that passes cannot be replaced. Do away with whatever you can of distractions and obstacles which prevent you from striving your utmost to attain knowledge. Hence the salaf encouraged keeping away from one’s family and keeping a distance from one’s homeland, because when a person is distracted he will not be able to understand facts of knowledge and subtle issues. Allah has not given man two hearts in his chest, and similarly it is said that knowledge will not give you a part of it until you give it your all.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"6_ndash_Be_cautious\"><strong>6 – Be cautious</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Beware of being preoccupied in the beginning with the disputes among the scholars, or among people in general, because this confuses the mind. Also beware of musannafaat , because they will waste your time and make you confused. Instead, give your all to the book which you are reading or the topic which you are studying until you become competent in it. Beware of moving from one book to another (before completing the former), for that is a sign of boredom and failure. You must pay attention to each branch of knowledge, in order of importance.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"7_ndash_Precision_and_focus\"><strong>7 – Precision and focus</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Strive to verify that which you want to memorize so that you are certain of it, either from a shaykh or from someone else who can help you. Then memorize it properly and continually repeat it and review at specific times each day, lest you forget what you have memorized.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"8_ndash_Studying_books\"><strong>8 – Studying books</strong></span></h4>\n<p>After you have memorized the summarized books properly, with their commentaries, and you have understood any difficult passages in them and understood the important points, then move on to studying the detailed versions, always reviewing what you have learned and noting the valuable points, subtle issues, strange minor issues, solutions to problems and differences between similar rulings, in all branches of knowledge. Do not think little of anything useful that you learn or any basic principle that you understand; instead, hasten to note and memorize it.</p>\n<p>Let your concern to seek knowledge be uppermost; do not be content to learn only a little when you are able to do more. Do not be content with a little of the legacy of the Prophets (may the blessings of Allah be upon them), and do not delay learning anything that you can, or be distracted or put off by wishful thinking. Delay is a problem, and if you learn something now you can learn something else later.</p>\n<p>Make the most of your time, when you are free and when you are busy. Make the most of your youth when your mind is fresh and you have less distractions, before you become distracted by false ambitions and the desire for worldly possessions.</p>\n<p>You should try to obtain as many of the books you need as you can, because they are the tools of learning. Do not make getting and keeping a lot of them (without benefiting from them) the only share of knowledge that you have, and collecting them the only share of understanding that you have. You also have to use and benefit from them as much as you can.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"9_ndash_Choosing_companions\"><strong>9 – Choosing companions</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Strive to choose righteous friends who are preoccupied with seeking knowledge and are of a good nature, who can help you in achieving your aim, add to the benefits you have already gained, encourage you to seek more knowledge and stop you from feeling bored and tired; friends who are religiously-committed, trustworthy and of good character, who are sincere towards Allah and who are not merely messing about. (See Tadhkirat al-Saami’ by Ibn Jamaa’aah).</p>\n<p>Beware of the bad companion, for he may influence you and people are like birds, they will resemble one another [i.e., “birds of a feather flock together”]. So beware of mixing with people like that, for that is a sickness, and prevention is better than cure.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"10_ndash_Finally_good_manners_towards_the_shaykh\"><strong>10 – Finally, good manners towards the shaykh</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Knowledge cannot be gained only from books; you must also have a shaykh whom you trust to open the door to knowledge and keep you from making mistakes. So you must have good manners towards him, for this is the way to success, learning and strength. So you must honour, respect and be polite to the shaykh. Observe the utmost standards of etiquette when you sit with your shaykh and speak with him. Ask questions in a proper manner and listen attentively. Be polite when studying the book with him and do not try to argue with him or compete with him. Do not initiate conversation with him or walk ahead of him or speak too much in his presence, or interrupt him or interrupt him when he is teaching. Do not pressurize him to give you an answer, and avoid asking him too many questions, especially in front of other people, for this will make you appear to be showing off and make him bored with you. Do not call him directly by his name or nickname; rather say “O my shaykh” or “O our shaykh” (Yaa shaykhi or Yaa shaykhanaa)</p>\n<p>If you think that the shaykh has made a mistake, do not let that make him lose respect in your eyes, because that will deprive you of his knowledge. Who is there who is entirely free from error? See Hilyat Taalib al-‘Ilm by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to make you and us strong and steadfast, and to let us see the day when you will become one of the scholars of the Muslims and an authority in the religion of Allah and one of the imaams of the pious.&nbsp; Ameen, ameen.. We hope to meet soon, and peace be upon you.</p>\n<p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>\n",

But Shaytaan (Satan) wishes to lead them far astray.</p>\n<p>61.&nbsp;And when it is said to them: “Come to what Allaah has sent down and to the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم),” you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) see the hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with aversion”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4: 59 -61]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:65]</p>\n<p>And there are other verses which enjoin referring for judgement to that which Allaah has revealed and forbid referring for judgement to anything that goes against it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if a person is forced to refer for judgement to man-made laws, in order to ward off wrongdoing or get back his rights, it is permissible for him to do that subject to certain conditions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.That he cannot get his rights except by this way.</p>\n<p>2.That he should do it reluctantly and hate this way of referring for judgement.</p>\n<p>3.That he should not take more than his due, even if the law gives it to him.</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: What is the ruling on referring for judgement to American law in a dispute between Muslims, with regard to cases of divorce, commerce and other matters?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: It is not permissible for a Muslim to refer for judgement to man-made laws except in cases of necessity if there are no sharee’ah courts. If he is awarded something that is not his right, it is not permissible for him to take it. End quote.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/502&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on the work of a Muslim who studies man-made law, then opens a law office and represents cases in civil courts on behalf of companies? What is the ruling on the money that he accumulates?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: Putting man-made laws that are contrary to sharee’ah in the place of sharee’ah is kufr, because it is removing sharee’ah and putting taghoot (falsehood) in its place, and this is included in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to a person learning man-made law, if he is learning it in order to ward off falsehood with truth, there is nothing wrong with that. But if he is learning it in order to follow what is contains of laws contrary to sharee’ah, this is haraam. Concerning that we say: even with regard to the lawyer in a country that is governed by sharee’ah, we say that if the lawyer wants to bring people's rights to them, there is nothing wrong with practising this profession, but if he wants to prove the other party wrong, whether it is true or false, this is haraam.

      "title": "Will children be rewarded for their good deeds?",
      "question": "<p>I know that a person is not accounted for his sins before the age of puberty, what about his good deeds, does he get rewarded for them?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Yes, children will be rewarded for doing good deeds, because of the hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1335) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: “A woman lifted up a child and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, will his Hajj (pilgrimage) be counted?’ He said, ‘Yes, and you will be rewarded.’” The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel fi Sharh Mukhtasar Shaykh al-Khaleel said, regarding the matter of children being instructed to pray when they reach the age of seven: “Al-Qaraafi said in al-Yawaaqeet fi’l-Mawaaqeet: children will earn reward for good deeds that they do because of the hadeeth (prophetic narration) of the Khath’ami woman [who lifted up her child and asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about his Hajj].”</p>\n<p>Ibn Rushd said: “The bad deeds of young children are not recorded but their good deeds will be recorded, according to the sound opinion.”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed, commenting on the first hadeeth quoted therein, which is the hadeeth of the Khath’ami woman: “… Abu’l-‘Aaliyah al-Riyaahi said: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: the young child’s good deeds will be recorded but his bad deeds will not be recorded.”</p>\n<p>The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel said, concerning children entering ihraam (sacred state) for Hajj and ‘Umrah:</p>\n<p>“The scholars do not differ concerning the fact that children will be rewarded for whatever acts of obedience (to Allaah) they do, and will be let off for any bad deeds that they do, and any bad deeds they do deliberately will be counted as mistakes. It says in Mukhtasar al-Waadihah: ‘Hajj is not an obligation for boys and girls until boys reach puberty and girls begin menstruating, but there is nothing wrong with taking them for Hajj. It is recommended (mustahabb), and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did so.’”</p>\n<p>Then he reported that Talhah ibn Musarrif said: “It was one of the customs of the Muslims to take their children for Hajj and expose them to the mercy of Allaah.”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed that it is encouraged to take children for Hajj, and that the majority of scholars say this. He also said: “It is nothing strange that a child should earn reward and status in the Hereafter for his salaah (prayers), zakaah (paying poor-due), Hajj and other good deeds if he does them as they should be done, (because this is) grace and mercy from Allaah, just as Allaah shows mercy to the dead by rewarding them for acts of charity done on their behalf by the living. Do you not see that they (the scholars) are agreed that a child should be commanded to pray when he reaches the age of understanding and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led Anas and the orphan in prayer? Most of the salaf (pious predecessors) said that zakaah has to be paid on the property of orphans, and it is impossible that they would not be rewarded for that. Their guardians and the one who does this on their behalf will also certainly be rewarded, as will the one who takes them for Hajj, as a blessing and mercy from Allaah. It was reported that ‘Umar said: ‘Children’s good deeds will be recorded and their bad deeds will not be recorded.’ I do not know of anyone whose opinion is worth following who said anything to the contrary.”</p>\n<p>According to al-Ikmaal, many of the scholars said: “Children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience (to Allaah), and their good deeds will be recorded, but not their bad deeds.”</p>\n<p>It says in Awaa’il al-Muqaddimaat: “The correct opinion in my view is that they are both encouraged to do that and will both be rewarded for it (i.e., the child and his or her guardian). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the woman [who asked about the child’s Hajj]: ‘… and you will be rewarded.’ And Allaah knows best.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Jamaa’ah said: “According to the four (imams/leading scholars), children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience and their good deeds will be recorded, whether they are mature or not. This was reported from ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him. Some scholars report that there was consensus (ijmaa’) in this matter. It is also indicated by what we have already said under the heading of Virtues (fadaa’il), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The jihaad (physival battle) of the very old and the very young is Hajj and ‘Umrah,’ as well as the hadeeth about the woman who lifted up a child.”</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it mandatory for a pregnant woman to observe fasting in Ramadan and Ashura. I advised my wife not to fast during last Ramadan and she was not fasting because she was pregnant. She was weak and anemic last time when she was pregnant. She had miscarried by the end of Ramadan when she was 12 weeks pregnant. What is the ruling about her missed fasting during Ramadan? Does she have to complete them before next Ramadan? Can she fast normally when she finds that she is pregnant? She always insists on fasting during pregnancy. Any medical evidences will also help that the baby won't be harmed by fasting during pregnancy.</p>\n",

Breaking the fast becomes obligatory if she fears that she may die or be severely harmed if she fasts. In that case, she has to make up the fast later on but she does not have to pay the fidyah. This is according to the consensus of the fuqaha, because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And do not kill yourselves.” [al-Nisa 4:29]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and do not throw yourselves into destruction.” [al-Baqarah 2:195]</p>\n<p>The scholars are similarly agreed that it is not obligatory to pay the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49944\" target=\"_blank\">fidyah</a> in this case, because a woman in this case is like one who is sick and one who fears for his life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the woman fears for her baby only (and not for herself), then some of the scholars are of the view that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/37719\" target=\"_blank\">it is permissible for her to break her fast</a> , but they say that she must make up the fast later on and pay the fidyah (which means feeding one poor person for each day not fasted), because of the report narrated from Ibn 'Abbas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184]</p>\n<p>Ibn 'Abbas said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This is a concession allowed to old men and women, who can only fast with difficulty; they are allowed to break the fast and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/93243\" target=\"_blank\">to feed one poor person for each day of fasting missed</a> . This also applies to pregnant and nursing women, if they are afraid.” Abu Dawud said: “i.e., if they are afraid for their children, they may break the fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1947; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 4/18, 25) (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 16/272)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence it is clear that if fasting will cause great harm to a woman or to her baby, she is obliged to break the fast, on condition that the doctor who states that fasting will cause harm is a doctor who can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This has to do with breaking the fast during Ramadan. With regard to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/303756\" target=\"_blank\">‘Ashura</a> , fasting on this day is not obligatory, according to scholarly consensus; rather it is mustahabb, and it is not permissible for a woman to observe a nafl fast when her husband is present, except with his permission. If he tells her not to fast then she has to obey him, especially if that is in the interests of the fetus.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_a_miscarriage_in_Ramadan_affects_a_womanrsquos_fast\">How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to miscarriage: “If the matter is as mentioned, that the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/95762\" target=\"_blank\">miscarriage occurred in the third month of pregnancy</a> , then the blood that comes out is not considered to be the blood of nifas (bleeding following childbirth), rather it is the blood of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/68810\" target=\"_blank\">istihadah</a> (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), because what the woman passed was a clot (‘alaqah) in which there were no human features. On this basis, she should pray and fast even if she sees some blood, but she should do wudu for each prayer, and she has to make up the days when she did not fast and the prayers that she missed.” (See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10.218)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ruling_on_making_up_missed_fasts_by_a_pregnant_woman\">Ruling on making up missed fasts by a pregnant woman</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the fasts that a pregnant woman has missed: “Everyone who owes fasts from Ramadan has to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/65875\" target=\"_blank\">make them up before the next Ramadan</a> . They may delay that until Sha’ban. But if the next Ramadan comes and he has not made them up and had no excuse for that, then he is guilty of sin and he has to make them up as well as feeding one poor person for each day, as was stated by a number of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The amount to be given is half a sa’ of the local staple food for each day, which may be given to a number of poor persons or to one. But if a person had an excuse for delaying making up the fasts, because he was sick or was traveling, then all he has to do is to make up the missed fasts, and he does not have to feed the poor, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>‘but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.’ [al-Baqarah 2:184].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah is the Source of strength.” &nbsp;(Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/340)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He wants to do ‘umrah on behalf of someone who has been missing for four years, and he is asking about the ruling on doing ‘umrah on his behalf; will the one who does ‘umrah or Hajj on his behalf be rewarded?",
      "question": "<p>My question has to do with ‘umrah in Ramadan, as I am going to do ‘umrah soon, and I hope that you can answer my question. The father of a friend of mine in Syria, in Damascus, disappeared four years ago, and we have had no news of him. We have spent the last four years looking for him and asking about him, with no success until now, no trace of him and no news. My questions are: 1. Can we assume that my friend’s father has died? What are the rulings once it is assumed that someone who has disappeared is dead? 2. Is it permissible for me to do ‘umrah on his behalf? 3. Will we both receive the reward of ‘umrah in Ramadan, which is equivalent to Hajj, in sha Allah? Or is it only me that will attain this reward?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If someone is lost and disappears to the extent that it is not known whether he is alive or dead, then he may be deemed to have died after the passage of a certain length of time, when it becomes most likely that if he were still alive, you would have heard news of him by now.</p>\n<p>The most correct view regarding the definition of this period is that reference should be made to the qaadi (shar‘i judge). The qaadi is the one who should define what that time period is, because the circumstances of those who go missing and the causes that led to their disappearance vary greatly. &nbsp;So the case of each missing person should be examined by the qaadi in order to determine the most appropriate period in light of the incident that led to his disappearance.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/226048\" target=\"_blank\">226048</a> .</p>\n<p>In the case of this man who is missing in Syria, if he went out of his house as normal and did not return for four years, then in this case it is most likely that his absence is due to his having died.</p>\n<p>But because of the complicated circumstances and situation of people in Syria, and because of the seriousness of the rulings that result from deeming him to have died, no one should determine that he has died except the qaadi.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, regarding the issue of one who is missing:</p>\n<p>It is essential to have the ruling of a qaadi, to avoid causing chaos among people, because if we say that every woman whose husband has gone missing should wait for a certain length of time until she thinks it most likely that he has died, then she may remarry, that would lead to chaos.</p>\n<p>It is essential to consult the qaadi, for he is the one who should handle this matter, and this is a must.\" (A<em>sh-Sharh al-Mumti‘</em>&nbsp; 13/374).</p>\n<p>If there is a qaadi (shar‘i judge) in your area, then he should be consulted to rule concerning this matter.</p>\n<p>If there is no qaadi or it is not possible to contact him, then the scholars in your area should act in the stead of the qaadi, because it is a matter of necessity. So one of the trustworthy scholars may rule concerning that, who is qualified to issue fatwas concerning such matters, and his ruling will be binding, like the ruling of the judge.</p>\n<p>Ad-Dasooqi al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Note regarding some issues connected to the missing person: his marriage may be annulled because of his not spending on his wife’s maintenance or because his wife is harmed because of the empty bed. But his marriage can only be annulled by a qaadi, unless it is difficult to find a qaadi either in a real sense are in a metaphorical sense, such as if the qaadi insists on charging to annul the marriage, in which case a group of Muslims may act in his stead, as was mentioned by our shaykh al-‘Adawi.\" (<em>Haashiyat ad-Daasooqi</em>&nbsp; 3/302).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>With regard to the rulings that result from the determination that the missing person has died, there are many rulings, the most important of which are:</p>\n<p>His wealth should be divided among his heirs if the qaadi rules that he has died.</p>\n<p>His wife should observe the ‘iddah of one whose husband has died, from the time it is determined that he has died. After her ‘iddah ends, she may remarry if she wishes.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/214999\" target=\"_blank\">214999</a> .</p>\n<p>With regard to doing ‘umrah on behalf of this missing person, there is nothing wrong with doing ‘umrah on his behalf, even if the judge has not determined that he has died, because doing an act of worship on behalf of someone else, or dedicating the reward of that to him, is not a transgression against any of the rights of the missing person, or any of his relatives, so it is not taking away someone’s rights or neglecting someone’s rights, and it is not a matter to be strict about. The matter is broad in scope, praise be to Allah.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/228060\" target=\"_blank\">228060</a> .</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If someone does ‘umrah or Hajj on behalf of someone who is deceased or incapacitated, will he have a similar reward, or is the reward only for the one on whose behalf it was done?</p>\n<p>There are two scholarly views concerning this matter, as the texts concerning it are not clear.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, undoubtedly the one who does that on behalf of someone else will be rewarded for showing kindness to his brother by doing the rituals on his behalf, and he will be rewarded for whatever he does of acts of worship that are separate from the actions of Hajj, that he does in the Haram, such as prayer, dhikr, du‘aa’, and so on.</p>\n<p>With regard to any reward in addition to the reward for that, that is subject to Allah’s will, and Allah’s bounty and kindness are immense.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/174707\" target=\"_blank\">174707</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Reciting du`a in Qunut al-Witr is permissible for the imam and the one who is praying alone, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (1425) and Ibn Maajah (1178) from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me some words to say in qunoot al-witr: “Allahumma’hdinee fiman hadayta wa ‘aafinee fiman ‘aafayta wa tawallanee fiman tawallayta wa baarik lee fimaa a’tayta wa qinee sharra maa qadayt, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa ‘alayk.

Protect me from the evil You have decreed for verily You decree and none can decree over You. For surety, he whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take an enemy is never honored and mighty. O our Lord, Blessed and Exalted are You. There is no refuge from You except with You).”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i. See also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/14093\">14093</a>.</p>\n<p>It is not proven that Qunut al-Witr is something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, rather it is proven that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did it, as was narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Bayhaqi.</p>\n<p>Hence some of the scholars are of the view that it is better not to recite al-Qunut all the time, rather one should do it sometimes and not at other times. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) (4/19).</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that one should not recite Qunut except in the second half of Ramadaan. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i and of Maalik in one report.</p>\n<p>Al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Qunut should not be recited in Ramadaan except in the second half (of the month). This is what Ibn ‘Umar and Mu’aadh al-Qaari used to do. End quote from Mukhtasar al-Muzani, published with al-Umm (8/114).</p>\n<p>Al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa (1/210): Two reports were narrated from Maalik concerning that, one of which says that Qunut should not be recited in Witr at all, and the other says that it is mustahabb during the second half of Ramadaan, This was reported by Ibn Habeeb from Maalik, and this was also the view of al-Shaafa’i.</p>\n<p>Abu Haneefah and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them) were of the view that Qunut should be recited throughout Ramadaan, and Qunut may be recited in Witr throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Qunut is Sunnah in Witr, in the single rak’ah, throughout the year. This is what is narrated by our companions and this is the view of Ibn Mas’ood, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and ashaab al-ra’i. It was also narrated from al-Hasan.</p>\n<p>Another opinion was narrated from Ahmad, which is that Qunut should not be recited except during the second half of Ramadaan. That was also narrated from ‘Ali and Ubayy, and it was the view of Ibn Sireen, Sa’eed ibn Abi’l-Hasan, al-Zuhri, Yahya ibn Wathaab, Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and it was the view favoured by Abu Bakr al-Athram, because of the report narrated from al-Hasan, that ‘Umar united the people behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b, and he used to lead them in prayer for twenty nights during which he only recited Qunut in the second half. Narrated by Abu Dawood. This is like consensus.</p>\n<p>Qataadah said: Qunut should be recited throughout the year except in the first half of Ramadaan, because of this report. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that he only recited Qunut in the second half of Ramadaan.</p>\n<p>And it was narrated that he did not recite Qunut in prayer at all.</p>\n<p>The first report is the one that is favoured by most of our companions. Ahmad said, according to the report of al-Marwadhi: I was of the view that it should be done in the second half of Ramadaan, but now I recite Qunut, because it is du`a and is good,and because of the report narrated from Ubayy, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Witr, and recite Qunut before bowing. It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say at the end of his Witr: “Allahumma innee a’oodhu bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika, wa a’oodhu bika minka. La uhsee thanaa’an ‘alayka, anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsik (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your protection from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from You. I cannot praise You enough, and You are as You have praised Yourself.”&nbsp; He did that all the time, and Ubayy’s action indicates that he saw him. The difference of opinion among the Sahaabah concerning this is not to be criticized, because it is Witr, in which Qunut is prescribed, like the latter half, and because it is dhikr that is prescribed in Witr, so it is prescribed throughout the year like any other dhikr. End quote from al-Mughni (1/447).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>One should not make the du`a of Qunut too lengthy, rather al-Baghawi said: It is makrooh to make Qunut lengthy, just as it is makrooh to make the first tashahhud lengthy. [Quoted by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo’, 3/479]. Al-Qaadi Husayn said: If Qunut is made lengthier than usual, that is makrooh, and may be invalid. [Quoted by al-Khateeb al-Sharbayni in Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 1/167].</p>\n<p>One should also avoid that which has been introduced by some imams who turn it into an exhortation by mentioning the grave, the resurrection, the reckoning and so on, which is more suited to sermons and exhortations than du`a and Qunut. If it is limited to the du`a that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to al-Hasan, or adds a little to that, this is better. It is a short du`a that you should learn by heart, so there is no need to look at a piece of paper.</p>\n<p>If you add some other short du`as that were taught by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this will be good, and it is easy to do.</p>\n<p>But if the imam or the worshipper is not able to memorize the du`as that are to be recited in Witr, there is nothing wrong with him choosing whatever du`as he wishes, because there is no specific du`a to be recited in Qunut, and al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad narrated that the scholars were unanimously agreed on that. [See: al-Majmoo’ 3/477].</p>\n<p>Now that we understand that the basic principle concerning the du`a of Qunut is that it is a short du`a, and that making it lengthy is makrooh and contrary to the Sunnah, and that there is no specific du`a to be recited, not even the du`a that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then there is no need to write the du`a on a piece of paper and read it whilst praying. Rather it seems that the motive for doing that is the desire on the part of imams or worshippers to&nbsp; recite complicated du`as and to make Qunut lengthy, as is the case with many imams nowadays.</p>\n<p>What the worshipper should do is be keen to ponder and focus, because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3479) from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Call upon Allah and be certain of a response, and understand that Allah does not answer a du`a from a heedless heart.” This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>There is no sin on a fasting person if he uses toothpaste, but he should be careful to avoid swallowing any of it.</p>\n<p>See also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13619</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A very personal and difficult to explain<br />\n      question:<br />\nI have a boy-friend who is originally from XXX,<br />\n   so he is a muslim. He now lives in the XXX and I live in<br />XXX. I am a christian.<br />He has asked me to marry him and I have agreed.<br /> The problem is .... his family. <br />They have arranged a future wife for him, but he does notwish to marry<br />\n      her. But out of respect for his father he will anyway, unles I become a muslim.<br />Then he HOPES his father will agree to our marriage.<br />Once I knew this, I asked him, what his family would do if they found out<br />\n      he intends to marry a European girl.<br />He could not really answer that question. <br />Now my question is: Do you have any idea how the family might react, and<br />\n      is it likely that the father would agree if I am a muslim?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is difficult to say what their reaction will be. Most parents want    their children to marry in accordance with their wishes, and in most cases they will have    chosen a wife for their son from their own country, whose customs and tradition are closer    to those of the society in which they live. The idea of their son marrying a western woman    may be very strange for them and difficult to accept, especially if they have heard about    the widespread promiscuity in the West and the freedom with which Western women enter into    relationships. They may also want their son to be near them, and they may be afraid that    if he marries someone overseas they will only see him rarely. They may warn him about the    consequences of raising his future children in a non-Islamic environment. On the other    hand, they might agree if they hear that their son is going to marry a decent, upright    Muslim girl, especially if their son is going to stay on and work in the West after    completing his studies, and if they give any weight to their son’s own wishes –    which is a matter that differs from family to family.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, you will not lose anything by entering Islam, whether    you marry this man or not. If you become Muslim and marry this man, after you both repent    from the forbidden relationship, then you will have got what you wanted. If this marriage    is not destined for you, then maybe Allaah will send you another good, clean Muslim man    whom you can marry and be happy with. The most important thing here is that you understand    that striving to please Allaah by following His religion is more important than all other    considerations. In any case, we hope that you will become Muslim and that your hopes will    be realized in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Thank you for your trust and your    question.</p>\n",

      "title": "A Christian woman is close to becoming Muslim and is married to a (Muslim) man who does not pray. What is the ruling on her marriage?",
      "question": "<p>There is a Christian woman who lives in Canada and is married to a Muslim man. She wanted to find out about Islam, and she has learned a lot at close hand and wanted to embrace it some day, but she was frustrated because she sees that her husband is careless about prayer, and the matter is so bad that he stopped praying a few months ago, until now. After he lost his job, he started to stay at home and his wife is the one who works and spends on household expenses. He just sits at the computer, talks to women and watches permissive movies on the net. To make matters worse, the wife found out about that by means of spy programs. <br />\n<br />\nWhat advice can you offer them? Please note that scholars differ as to whether the one who does not pray is a kaafir. I hope that you can explain this issue to us according to both views. May Allaah bless you. And I hope that you could send us the answer in both Arabic and English. May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars are unanimously agreed that the one who does not     pray because he denies that it is obligatory is a kaafir who is doomed to     remain eternally in the fire of Hell if he dies in that state, but they     differed concerning the one who does not pray, not because he denies that it     is obligatory, but because he is lazy and heedless. The majority of them     said that he should be asked to repent, and if he repents all well and good,     otherwise he is to be executed as a hadd punishment. Others said that he     should be given a disciplinary punishment (ta’zeer) and imprisoned until he     starts to pray. So there are three opinions concerning this issue:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The first opinion: that the one who does not pray is a     kaafir, without differentiating between the one who denies it and the one     who is lazy. This is the view of the Sahaabah, and no difference of opinion     is known among them. Among those who hold this view are: Imam Ahmad (may     Allaah have mercy on him) according to the more correct of the two opinions     narrated from him, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and Mansoor     al-Faqeeh among the Shaafa’is. It was also narrated from Abu’l-Tayyib ibn     Salamah among the Shaafa’is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The second opinion: that the one who does not pray because he     is lazy and heedless, not because he denies it, is one of the evildoers     among the Muslims, but he is not a kaafir. However, he should be asked to     repent -- although they differed concerning the time that should be allowed     for that -- then if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he is to be     executed as a hadd punishment! Like the married adulterer, but he should be     executed with the sword. This is the view of Maalik and his companions, and     it is the view of al-Shaafa’i and most of his companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The view that someone like this should be executed as a hadd     punishment is subject to further discussion. We have explained the error of     this opinion in the answer to question number    <a href=\"/en/answers/6035\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">6035</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The third opinion: that the person who does not pray     deliberately, because he is lazy and heedless, although he acknowledges that     it is obligatory, is not a kaafir and should not be executed, rather he     should be given a disciplinary punishment (ta’zeer) and imprisoned until he     begins to pray.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is the view of Imam Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy     on him) and his companions, and of a number of the people of Kufah, Sufyaan     al-Thawri, and of al-Mazani the companion of al-Shaafa’i, but it is the     weakest of the opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Many practical rulings are based on the difference in opinion     on the ruling on one who does not pray, such as: whether he inherits,     inheritance from him, whether he is to be washed and buried in the Muslim     graveyard, whether the funeral prayer is to be offered for him, ruling on     meat slaughtered or hunted by him, whether his marriage remains valid and     other rulings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For those who say that the one who does not pray is a kaafir     -- even if he does not deny it is obligatory -- all the rulings on apostates     apply to him. So he cannot inherit or be inherited from, he cannot be washed     (after he dies), he cannot be buried in the Muslim graveyard, the funeral     prayer cannot be offered for him, meat slaughtered by him is not halaal and     his marriage contract becomes invalid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For those who ruled that he is not a kaafir, the rulings     mentioned above do not apply to him; rather he is regarded as an evildoer     among the Muslims and one who is committing a major sin, but the majority of     them say that he should be asked to repent, then if he does not pray, he is     to be executed as a hadd punishment! Similarly -- in their view -- if he is     married to a Christian or Jewish woman, then his marriage contract is deemed     to be valid, and is the marriage contract between a Muslim man and a woman     from the People of the Book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The more correct of these two opinions is the first one,     because of the apparent meaning of the evidence from the Qur'aan and Sunnah,     and because of the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with     them) concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is what was stated in fatwas by shaykhs such as:     Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Muhammad ibn Saalih     al-‘Uthaymeen, the scholars of the Standing Committee and others, despite     the difference of opinion concerning the hadd punishment which the one who     does not pray is thought to deserve.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that: the marriage contract between this man and     that woman is a marriage contract between an apostate and the Christian     woman -- if she is still following her religion -- and her situation is less     serious than his, because she is a woman of the People of the Book, whilst     he is an apostate from his religion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answers to questions number    <a href=\"/en/answers/2182\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">2182</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/5208\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">5208</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/33007\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">33007</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/10094\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">10094</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the woman asked about, if she has become     Muslim, it is not permissible for her to stay with a man who does not pray.     The ruling on that has been discussed above in detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if she is still a nonbeliever, then their are no rulings     that have to do with her marriage to him, because they are both not Muslim.     Neither of them is Muslim so that the rulings of sharee’ah would apply to     their marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We advise her to leave this man and marry a man who is really     a Muslim. Because he does not pray, he is not regarded as a Muslim, and the     evils and sins that he commits are not part of the Muslim’s attitude.     Moreover, as seems to be the case to us from the question, he is lacking in     chivalry and decency, because he agrees to his wife going out to work and     bearing the burden of earning a living, whilst he sits at home. By Allaah,     his attitude would be wrong even if he were staying home to read Qur'aan and     pray, whilst his wife goes out to work and support him, so what should we     say about him when he is staying home to commit sin and evil?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we say to this wife is: O female slave of Allaah, do not     look at the religion on the basis of its people or on the basis of one of     them; rather look at what there is in it of truth, goodness, honesty and     righteousness. As for the people, if your husband is as you describe, then     among the Muslims there are people who adhere to its etiquette, rulings and     morals and manners apart from this man. There are still people, among both     Muslims and non-Muslims, who are sincere, righteous and decent, and there     are some who are not like that. But the attitude of the Muslim, if he still     follows his religion properly is more sublime and more righteous and purer     than the attitude of others. Think about it and you will find that this is     true. Remember that most of the Muslims around you are interested in worldly     gains and greed, and they have gone against the rulings of their religion     which forbid living in the lands of the kuffaar for the sake of worldly     gains and greed, so what kind of attitude do you expect from them? Very few     of them adhere to the commands of their religion, or they are living there     for a reason which makes that permissible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    O female slave of Allaah, hasten and do not delay; do not let     people and their attitudes be a barrier between you and light from your     Lord. Every soul is a pledge for that which it has earned, and people will     be called to account on the Day of Resurrection one by one, and no soul will     bear the burden of another: it will get what it deserves, good or bad. So     come to the light that you have seen, and beware of delaying, lest darkness     overwhelm you and the light of guidance disappear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If there is something that is keeping you away from the     light, remove it from your eyes no matter what it is, and hasten towards     your Lord on His straight path.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Can you differentiate clearly the difference between crying for a deceased person and wailing? Does wailing include shouting, and voicing your grief... and crying simply tears? This is confusing and I need clarity due to wailing being a sin.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Crying is well known; it refers to tears from the eyes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for wailing, according to the scholars has to do with words and sounds that come from the woman or man who is wailing. The words referred to here are eulogizing, listing his good qualities, keening (the well known chanting of women when they wail and lament), screaming and other well-known actions that are done by wailing women.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some fuqaha’ say that this applies if there is also crying, and others say that it is not necessarily accompanied by crying; rather it is connected to the actions of wailing mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the hadeeth: it was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah fell sick and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to visit him with ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas and ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas‘’ood (may Allah be pleased with them). When he entered upon him, he found him unconscious with his family around him and he said: “Has he died?” They said: No, O Messenger of Allaah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wept, and when the people saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) weeping, they also wept. He said: “Listen, Allaah does not punish for the tears of the eye or the grief of the heart, rather He punishes for this” – and he pointed to his tongue – “or shows mercy (because of it).”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1304; Muslim, 924&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and one of his daughters sent word to him, calling him and informing him that a child of hers – or a son of hers – was dying. He said to the messenger: “Go back to her and tell her that to Allaah belongs that which He has taken, and to Him belongs what He gives, and everything has an appointed time with Him. Tell her to be patient and seek reward.” Then the messenger came back and said: “She is adjuring you to come to her.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up, and Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah and Mu‘adh ibn Jabal got up with him, and I went with them. The child was lifted up to him and his soul was rattling like water poured into a waterskin. His eyes filled with tears and Sa‘d said to him: What is this, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: “This is compassion that Allaah has instilled in the hearts of His slaves. Allaah only shows mercy to the merciful ones among His slaves.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1284; Muslim, 923&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What this means is that Sa‘d thought that all kinds of crying or weeping were haraam, and that tears from the eye are haraam, and he thought that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had forgotten that, so he reminded him. But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him that simply crying or shedding tears from the eye is not haraam or makrooh; rather it is mercy and a virtue. What is haraam is wailing and lamenting and crying that is accompanied by both or one of them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He committed zina with a woman; is he allowed to marry her daughter?",
      "question": "<p>I am a thirty year old man. The shaytaan tempted me and I committed zina with a woman, then Allaah blessed me and had mercy on me, and I repented sincerely to Allaah, may Allaah accept it from me. Until now I have not gotten married. I have decided to get married and my mother has suggested a girl, but this girl is the daughter of the woman with whom I committed zina before (please note that the zina occurred two years ago, and her daughter is now twenty years old). Hence I hope that you can advise me whether this marriage is haraam or not? I hope that you can explain fully.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We ask     Allaah to accept your repentance. Strive to make it a sincere repentance,     because the crime of zina is a grave sin which results in many evils. The     married man who commits zina deserves to be stoned to death, and there is no     greater punishment than that among the hudood punishments, because of the     abhorrent and repugnant nature of this crime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice     to you is not to marry this girl, not because marrying her is haraam, but     because through this marriage you will become closer to her mother with whom     you committed zina, and getting close to her will remind you of that evil     sin, and the shaytaan may whisper to you again, and make sin appear     attractive to you, so you fall into it. Keeping away from reminders of evil     and sin is part of repentance. This is indicated by the hadeeth about the     one who killed one hundred people; the scholar told him to leave his village     because its people were evil and immoral people. This is part of repenting     fully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard     to whether it is permissible to marry this girl, there was a difference of     opinion among the scholars regarding such cases. Al-Shaafa’i and Maalik –     according to one of the two reports narrated from him – said that it is     permissible, but Abu Haneefah, Ahmad and Maalik – according to the other     report – said that such a marriage is haraam. The more correct is the first     view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd     al-Barr said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They     differed concerning a man who commits zina with a woman; is it permissible     for him to marry her daughter or mother? Similarly, if he committed zina     with a woman, can his son or father marry her? In all these cases, does zina     make haraam what a valid marriage or an invalid marriage makes haraam (i.e.,     makes certain relatives mahrams to whom marriage is forbidden)?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maalik said     in his Muwatta’: Zina with a woman does not make it haraam for the     one who commits zina with her to marry her daughter or mother. If a man     commits zina with the mother of his wife, his wife does not become haraam to     him, rather he should be killed. Zina does not make haraam anything that a     permissible marriage makes haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the     view of Ibn Shihaab al-Zuhri and Rabee’ah; it was also the view of al-Layth     ibn Sa’d, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Thawr and Dawood. It was also narrated from Ibn     ‘Abbaas, who said concerning that: A haraam deed does not make something     permissible haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn     al-Qaasim narrated from Maalik something other than what is said in     al-Muwatta’. He said: If a man commits zina with the mother of his wife,     he must be separated from his wife, and in his view he comes under the     ruling of one who has married his wife’s mother and consummated the marriage     with her. This is also the view of Abu Haneefah and his companions, and of     al-Thawri and al-Awzaa’i, all of whom said that if a man commits zina with     his wife’s mother, then his wife becomes haraam for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sahnoon     said: The companions of Maalik all disagreed with Ibn al-Qaasim on this     matter and they agreed with what it says in al-Muwatta’. Allaah has     forbidden the Muslim to marry his wife’s mother or daughter. If a man owns a     slave woman and he has intercourse with her, then her mother and daughter     also become haraam for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly,     if his father has intercourse with a woman whom he marries or owns as a     slave, they become haraam for the son, and vice versa. This has to do with     permissible types of intercourse. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>These     fuqaha’ – the ones who were qualified to issue fatwas in the Islamic regions     – were unanimously agreed that it is not haraam for a man to marry a woman     with whom he committed zina, if it is established that she is not pregnant,     so it is more likely that he is permitted to marry her mother or daughter.     And Allaah is the source of strength.</p>\n<p>Al-Istidhkaar     (5/463, 464).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh     Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The correct     view is that the mother of a woman with whom a man has committed zina is not     haraam for the one who did that, and the daughter of the woman with whom he     committed zina is not haraam for the one who did that, because Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“All     others are lawful”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’     4:24]</p>\n<p>Allaah did     not mention the mother or daughter of a woman with whom zina has been     committed as being among those to whom marriage is forbidden, rather He     said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“your     wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your     wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not     gone in them (to marry their daughters),”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’     4:23]</p>\n<p>It is well     known that the woman with whom a man has committed zina is not one of his     wives at all. As she is not one of his wives, it is not valid to compare     fornication to valid marriage. If he has repented from zina it is     permissible for him to marry the mother or daughter of a woman with whom he     committed zina. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh     al-Mumti’ (7/38, 39)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conclusion:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a     matter concerning which the scholars differed. The correct view is that it     is permissible to marry the daughter of a woman with whom one has committed     zina so long as she is not one’s own daughter, but our advice to you is     not to marry her for two reasons: to be on the safe side, because she is     haraam for you according to many of the scholars, and so that your marriage     to her will not be a cause of your getting close to her mother and getting     in touch with her, which may lead to you going back to that sin from which     you have repented. And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A man is travelling by plane and does not know the direction of the qiblah and no one else on board knows either. So he prays, and does not know whether he is facing the qiblah or not. Is his prayer in such cases valid?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a traveller who is on board a plane wants to pray a naafil prayer, then he can pray no matter what direction he is facing; he does not have to face the qiblah, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray whilst riding his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, if he was travelling. But in the case of the obligatory prayers, it is essential to face the qiblah and to do rukoo’ and sujood if possible. So if a person is able to pray on board the plane, then he should do so. If the prayer which falls due whilst he is on the plane can be joined with another prayer later on, e.g., Zuhr, which he can delay and join with ‘Asr, or Maghrib which he can delay and join with ‘Isha’, he can do that. He has to ask the stewards about the direction of the qiblah if he is on board an airplane which does not have a sign to show the direction of the qiblah. If he does not do that, then his prayer is not valid.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is the ruling on swallowing saliva after it reaches the lips?",
      "question": "<p>As we are wearing masks nowadays to protect ourselves against coronavirus (COVID-19), sometimes when I speak behind the mask some saliva comes out, although it is not a lot, and it sticks to the lips, so I cannot remove it, and I do not know whether it goes back into my mouth again or not. Does this invalidate the fast? What if it dries on the lips, then I close my lips after a while – is it still regarded as traces that are still there, or if it has dried can we say that there is nothing wrong with it?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If saliva reaches the lips, then the person swallows it unintentionally, such as if he licks his lips and the like unintentionally, there is no blame on him. Similarly, if it dries up, then he closes his lips, its traces disappear when it dries up, and there is nothing left that could cause one to break the fast at all, whether deliberately or by mistake.</p>\n<p>If you deliberately swallow this saliva after it reaches the lips, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether that breaks the fast.</p>\n<p>The Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that it does invalidate the fast, because in that case the saliva has separated from where it usually is, which is the inside of the mouth, so swallowing it is like&nbsp; swallowing anything else that is separate from the body.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12597\" target=\"_blank\">swallowing</a> of saliva which does not break the fast: Swallowing it from its usual place [does not break the fast], but if it has come out of the mouth, then the person brings it back with his tongue or otherwise and swallows it, it does break the fast.</p>\n<p>Our companions said: If it comes out to the outside of the lips, then he takes it back and swallows it, it breaks the fast because it is his fault and because it had left its usual place where it could be overlooked. Al-Mutawalli said: If it came out to his lips, then he took it back and swallowed it, he has broken his fast.\" (A<em>l-Majmoo‘</em> 6/342).</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If his saliva comes out and gets onto his garment or between his fingers or between his lips, then he takes it back and swallows it, he has broken the fast, because he swallowed it from somewhere other than his mouth, so it is like swallowing anything else.\" (A<em>l-Mughni</em>&nbsp; 3/17).</p>\n<p>The Hanafis are of the view that it does not invalidate the fast unless it becomes separate from the mouth, then he takes it back into his mouth.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Fath al-Qadeer</em> (2/332): If his saliva came out of his mouth, then he took it back in and swallowed it, if it did not become separate from his mouth – rather it remained connected to what is in his mouth, like a thread, and he took it in and swallowed it – he has not broken his fast. But if it became separated, then he took it back, he has broken his fast, but he does not have to offer any expiation, such as if he swallowed someone else’s saliva, or if it collected in his mouth then he swallowed it; that is makrooh, but it does not break the fast. End quote.</p>\n<p>You should be careful with regard to the saliva that accumulates on the mask and becomes separate from the mouth. So do not deliberately take it back into the mouth and swallow it.</p>\n<p>Regarding that which is difficult to avoid or enters the mouth without you intending it to, that is most likely to be overlooked, because it is a small amount and difficult to avoid. The Lawgiver overlooks traces of water that remain in the mouth after rinsing it [when doing wudoo’].</p>\n<p>If you do not know whether it entered the mouth again or not, it is more appropriate to disregard it, because the basic principle is that you have not broken the fast, and that the saliva has not returned to the mouth.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/275556\" target=\"_blank\">275556</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49005\" target=\"_blank\">49005</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The question is somewhat vague. If what is meant is that    they recite it all together, in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, then this    is not prescribed in Islam and at the very least it is makrooh (disliked), because it is    not reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his    Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) did any such thing. But if this is done for    the purpose of teaching, we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is    that the people gather to recite Qur’aan in order to memorize and learn it, and each    one recites whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself – not in unison    with the others – then this is permissible because it was reported that the Messenger    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No group of people    gathers in one of the houses of Allaah to recite the Book of Allaah and study it together,    but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them, mercy comes down upon them,    and Allaah mentions them to those who are with Him.” </p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim).</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Distributing tapes which     contain lessons, lectures and guidance is a means of giving charity on     behalf of the deceased, if it is intended that the reward should go to him.     This is one of the best things that the living can do for the dead, and this     is confirmed in the shar’i texts which indicate that the reward will reach     the one on whose behalf charity is given.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from     ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that a man said to the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): My mother died suddenly     and I think that if she could have spoken she would have given charity; will     she have a reward if I give charity on her behalf?

      "question": "<p>How should we deal with Muslims who do not fast in Ramadaan? What is the best way to call them to fast?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What should be done is to call these Muslims to fast and encourage them to do so, and warn them against being heedless and negligent. This may be done in the following ways:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Informing them that it is obligatory to fast, and telling them of its great importance in Islam, for it is one of the great pillars upon which Islam is built.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Reminding them of the immense reward which comes from fasting, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 38; Muslim, 760.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and His Messenger, and establishes regular prayer and fasts Ramadaan, it will be his due that Allaah will admit him to Paradise, whether he strives in jihad for the sake of Allaah or stays in the land in which he was born.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not give these glad tidings to the people?” He said: “In Paradise there are one hundred levels which Allaah has prepared for those who strive in jihad for the sake of Allaah, and the distance between each two levels is like the distance between the heaven and the earth. When you ask of Allaah, ask him for al-Firdaws, for it is in the middle of Paradise, the highest part of Paradise. Above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful and from it spring forth the rivers of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7423.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘Fasting is for Me and I shall reward for it. He gives up his desire and his food and drink for My sake. Fasting is a shield, and the fasting person has two moments of joy, one when he breaks his fast and one when he meets his Lord. And the odour that comes from the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the fragrance of musk.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7492; Muslim, 1151.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Warning the one who does not fast, and explaining that this is a major sin. Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibbaan (7491) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: ‘Climb up.’ I said: ‘I cannot do it.’ They said: ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: ‘What are these voices?’ They said: ‘This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: ‘Who are these?’ They said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Mawaarid al-Zam’aan, 1509.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then deliberately broke his fast before the time for iftaar had come. So how about one who does not fast at all? We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38747\">38747</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 – Explaining how easy and straightforward fasting is, and the joy and contentment that there is in it, and how it brings peace of mind, as well as the joy and delight in worship during the days and nights of the fast, by reading Qur’aan and praying qiyaam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6 – Inviting them to listen to some lectures and read some books that speak of the fast and its importance and discuss various issues of fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 – Not getting bored or tired of calling them and reminding them, speaking in a kind and gentle manner, as well as praying sincerely for them to be guided and forgiven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

I have told my husband that I believe that this is haram (impermissible), but he says that it is halal (permissible) because the Shaykhs do that. Could you please give me some evidence (daleel) about this matter?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>1 – Seeking the help of the jinn or turning to them to fulfill one’s desires to cause harm or bring benefit is shirk or associating others in worship with Allah, because it is a kind of mutual benefitting whereby the jinn responds to the human’s requests and fulfills his needs in return for the human’s veneration of the jinn, turning to him and asking for his help to do what he wants.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):</p>\n<p>“And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,’ and their awliya (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: ‘Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.’ He will say: ‘The Fire be your dwelling place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allah may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.’</p>\n<p>And thus We do make the Zaalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) awliya (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn.” [6:128]</p>\n<p>“And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression.” [72:6]</p>\n<p>If a human seeks the help of a jinn to cause harm to another person, or seeks his help for protection from the evil of a person whose evil he fears, all of this is shirk.</p>\n<p>Whoever is like this, his prayer and his fasting are both invalid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.”</p>\n<p>[39:65]</p>\n<p>If a person is known for doing this, then the funeral prayer is not to be offered for him if he dies, his funeral is not to be attended, and he is not to be buried in the Muslim graveyard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – The Standing Committee was asked a similar question, which said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would like to inform you that in Zambia there is a Muslim man who claims that he has jinn with him, and the people go to him and ask him to heal their diseases, and this jinn prescribes medicine for them. Is this permissible?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The answer is:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for this man to use the services of the jinn, and it is not permissible for the people to go to him, seeking treatment for their diseases through advice from the jinn, or to fulfill any needs in this manner.</p>\n<p>Treating disease by means of human doctors and by using permissible medicines means that there is no need for that. This should be enough to free us from the control of these charlatans.</p>\n<p>It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days.” [Muslim]</p>\n<p>The four authors of al-Sunan, and al-Hakim in a saheeh hadeeth, narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he said has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.”</p>\n<p>This man and his companions from among the jinn are to be regarded as fortunetellers and soothsayers.

      "title": "A fabricated hadeeth about the reason why the five daily prayers were prescribed",
      "question": "<p>How authentic this Hadeeth is:<br />\n<br />\nIt was narrated that Ali, may Allah be pleased with him said: “While Allah’s messenger (PBUH) was sitting between the Ansaar and the Muhajireen, a group of Jews came to him and said: “Oh Muhammad! We ask you about words Allah has given to Moses Ben Imraan, Allah will not give them but to a sent messenger or a close angel. The prophet (PBUH) said: “Ask”. They said: “Oh Muhammad! Tell us about the five prayers that Allah obligated upon your nation”. The prophet (PBUH) said:<br />\n<br />\n“Fajr prayer: the sun rises between two horns of Satan, to it every disbeliever prostrates. Every believer who prays Fajr in congregation for forty days Allah will grant him two warrants, to save him from hell and hypocrisy. They said: “The truth you said, Oh Muhammad!” <br />\n<br />\nThe prophet (PBUH) continues: “Dhuhr prayer: It is the time that hell flares up during. Every believer who prays this prayer Allah will prevent him from the flames of hell at the Day of Resurrection.  <br />\n<br />\nAsr prayer: Is the time of when Adam, peace be upon him, ate from the tree. Every believer who prays this prayer Allah will clear him of all his since as if he was just born. <br />\n<br />\nMaghrib prayer: Is the time Allah accepted Adam’s repentance. Every believer who prays this prayer and asks Allah for anything, Allah will definitely give it to him.  <br />\n<br />\nIsha prayer: The grave is dark; the Day of Resurrection is also dark. Every believer who walks in darkness to pray this prayer, Allah will prevent him from hell, and he will given light by which he passes the Siraat (a bridge over hell in the hereafter). It is the prayer that messengers before me prayed. Then he recited saying: “Guard strictly the five obligatory prayers especially the middle Salaat (i.e. ‘Asr)”<br />\n<br />\nMay Allah reward you!.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>After studying and     researching this hadeeth, it is clear that it is false and is a fabrication     against the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); it is     not correct to attribute it to him in any circumstances. There is a     considerable amount of evidence for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – We did not find this     hadeeth in any of the books that narrate ahaadeeth with isnaad, rather those     who mentioned it narrated it from people without an isnaad. It is a well     known principle in our religion that any hadeeth that was not narrated by     the scholars of hadeeth with a saheeh isnaad is to be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Another of the obvious     signs that it is fabricated is the fact that we found this hadeeth quoted in     the book of Abu’l-Layth al-Samarqandi (d. 375 AH). The name of his book is    Tanbeeh al-Ghaafileen bi Ahaadeeth Sayyid al-Anbiya’ wa’l-Mursaleen     (p. 264-265). The scholars have stated that this book of his consists of     false and fabricated ahaadeeth. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah     have mercy on him) listed him in Talkhees al-Istighaathah (1/73) as     being among the authors who could not tell sound reports from weak, and who     has no experience of either narrated reports or of narrators, rather they     narrated both saheeh and da’eef reports, and they did not distinguish     between the two. And Imam al-Dhahabi said in his biography in Siyar     A’laam al-Nubala’ (16/323): he could accept fabricated ahaadeeth sue to     lack of knowledge. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Another reason why it     is to be rejected is that he says of Zuhr prayer that it is a time when Hell     is stoked. But what is proven is that the time when Hell is stoked is just     before the sun passes the meridian, just before Zuhr, but when the time for     Zuhr begins, the time of mercy begins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that     ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray four rak’ahs before Zuhr,     after the sun had passed the meridian, and he said: “The gates of heaven are     opened and I like to send forth a good deed at this time.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Ahmad (3/411);     classed as hasan by Ibn Hajar in Nataa’ij al-Afkaar (6/3) and by     Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (3404) and by the     commentators on al-Musnad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another reason is that it     goes against that which is mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth, that the five     daily prayers are one of the unique characteristics of the ummah of Muhammad      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they were not enjoined     on any of the Prophets who came before him. Although some of the scholars     disagreed with that, this is the correct view in sha Allaah. Al-Suyooti     wrote a chapter in al-Khasaa’is al-Kubra (2/303) entitled: Chapter on     the unique characteristics of (the Prophet)  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) in that the five daily prayers were all enjoined upon     him, which were not all enjoined for anyone else, and he was the first one     to pray ‘Isha’, which no Prophet before him prayed. In this chapter he     quoted a number of ahaadeeth, including the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from     Mu’aadh ibn Jabal that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said: “Delay this prayer (‘Isha’) until it is dark, for you have     been favoured with it over all other nations, and no nation prayed this     prayer before you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood     (421); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – Another sign of the     weakness of this hadeeth is that it defines the time when Adam ate from the     tree, and the time when Allaah accepted his repentance. Such details are     akin to what is mentioned in the Israa’eeliyaat (reports from Jewish     sources) and reports that are narrated from the People of the Book, which     makes it likely that this report was taken from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, this report is     false and has no basis, so it is not permissible to narrate it or attribute     it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or to     quote it on websites or in chat rooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>What the wife is obliged to do is to obey her     husband; he is the one whom she is obliged to obey. If the husband agrees that she may visit her family, it does not matter if his parents do not     approve.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But a woman should strive to please her     husband’s parents and treat them in a manner that is better, and not confront them.

So you should handle this     matter wisely and not be the cause of arguments or division between your husband and his parents.

      "question": "<p>I am sending this message to you because I am so anxious about this problem, namely the place where I work. It is a satellite TV company, one of whose channels is the Iqra’ religious channel which broadcasts religious programming, but there are also other channels such as music channels and Arabic movies. What should I do? Praise be to Allaah, I am a religiously-committed and bearded young man and I follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). My work is in the switchboard of the company; I answer the phones and transfer calls to the employees, and vice versa. At the same time I am looking for other work, but I cannot find anything. In my heart I am worried because of this work. Every time I hear the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “The slave’s feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection until he has been asked about four things,” including his wealth, I get worried because of that. I hope that you will advise me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We ask Allaah to guide you towards that which is best for     your religious commitment and worldly affairs, and we ask Allaah to grant     you a goodly (halaal) provision and to bless it for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your work in this company is not permissible, and it is     haraam earnings, because this company facilitates channels that promote     immorality, deviation and misguidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has forbidden us to commit sin and do haraam things     directly, and He has also forbidden us to help others in doing so. Allaah     says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has     indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of     unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of     all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with     Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah     of which you have no knowledge”</p>\n<p>    [al-‘Araaf 7:33]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Help you one another in     Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one     another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe     in punishment”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>Anyone who thinks about     these immoral channels will be amazed by the audacity of these people in     spreading immorality and opposition to sharee’ah and decent morals. For     every deviation, temptation or misguidance caused by these channels to any     individual, those who produce and work for these channels have a share of     the sin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day     of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without     knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nahl 16:25]</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Abu     Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… whoever calls to misguidance will     have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without that     detracting from their sins in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 2674.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Our advice to you is to leave this job, and look for other     work that is halaal and good. Be patient in bearing the problems that you     will encounter, for the reward of Allaah is precious. What matters is not     the work, rather what matters is that the work should be halaal. Beware of     nourishing your body on haraam food (earned through haraam work), and     remember that no soul will die until it has received its provision in full     and lived the time span decreed for it. Read the following hadeeth well and     think about it:</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “There is nothing that will bring you closer to Paradise but I have     enjoined it upon you, and there is nothing that will bring you closer to     Hell but I have forbidden it to you. The Holy Spirit (i.e. Jibreel) inspired     to me that no soul will die until it has been given its provision in full.     Fear Allaah and be moderate in seeking a living, and do not let the fact     that it is slow in coming make you seek it by disobeying Allaah, for that     which is with Allaah cannot be attained except by obeying Him.” See     al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2866.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Remember that Allaah has commanded us to eat from that which     is good and permissible (al-tayyibaat) and He has told us that haraam wealth     is one of the things that prevent du’aa’s from being answered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with     him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said: “Allaah is Good and does not accept anything but that which     is good. Allaah has issued the same command to the believers as He issued to     the Messengers, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘O (you) Messengers!     Eat of the Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods which Allaah has     made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats,     vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well‑Acquainted     with what you do’</p>\n<p>    [al-Mu’minoon 23:51]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic     Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with’</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:172].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Then he mentioned a man who has traveled for a long time and     is disheveled and dusty, and stretches forth his hands towards heaven,     saying, “O Lord, O Lord,” but his food is haraam, his drink is haraam, his     clothing is haraam and his nourishment is haraam, so how could he receive a     response? Narrated by Muslim, 1015.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So seek the help of Allaah and seek reward from Allaah. We     ask Allaah to give you strength and guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

There is a hadith concerning that which is not sahih, hence the scholars regarded celebrating this day as an innovation (bid ‘ah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muhammad ‘Abd al-Salam al-Shuqayri said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Imam al-Fatni said in Tadhkirat al-Mawdu‘at: Among the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10070\" target=\"_blank\">innovations</a> that have been introduced on “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8907\" target=\"_blank\">Laylat an-Nisf</a> ”&nbsp; (mid-Sha‘ban) is al-Salat al-Alfiyyah, which is one hundred rak‘ahs in which Surat al-Ikhlas is recited ten times in each rak‘ah, offered in congregation; they pay more attention to this than to Jumu‘ah and ‘Eid prayers, although there is no report concerning it, except da‘if (weak) and mawdu‘ (fabricated) reports, and we should not be deceived by the fact that these reports were quoted by the authors of al-Qut and al-Ihya and others, nor should we be deceived by what was mentioned in Tafsir al-Tha‘labi, that it is Laylat al-Qadr.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-'Iraqi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The hadith about the prayer on Laylat al-Nisf (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11722\" target=\"_blank\">mid-Sha‘ban</a> ) is false. Ibn al-Jawzi narrated it in al-Mawdu‘at (which is a compilation of fabricated hadiths):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on the hadith, prayer and supplication on Laylat al-Nisf:</p>\n<p>The hadith, “When the night of ‘nisf Sha‘ban’ (mid-Sha‘ban) comes, spend the night in prayer and fast on that day” was narrated by Ibn Majah from ‘Ali. Muhashiyyah said: (It was also narrated) in al-Zawaid. Its isnad is da‘if (weak) because of the weakness of Ibn Abi Basrah, of whom Ahmad and Ibn Ma'in said: He fabricates hadith.”</p>\n<p>Praying six rak‘ahs on Laylat al-Nisf with the intention of warding off calamity, having a long life and being independent of people, and reciting Ya-Sin and offering du‘a in between that -- there is no doubt that this is something that has been introduced into the religion and is contrary to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The commentator on al-Ihya said: This prayer is well known in the books of later Sufi masters, but I have not seen any sahih report in the Sunnah to support it and the connected du‘a. Rather this is the action of some shaykhs. Our companions said: It is makruh to gather on any of the nights mentioned in the mosques or elsewhere. Al-Najm al-Ghayti said, describing spending the night of al-Nisf min Sh‘ban (mid-Sha‘ban) praying in congregation: That was denounced by most of the scholars of the Hijaz, including ‘Ata and Ibn Abi Mulaykah, the fuqaha of Madinah and the companions of Malik. They said: All of that is an innovation (bid‘ah) and there is no report to suggest that the Prophet spent that night in praying in congregation or that his Companions did that either. Al-Nawawi said: The prayers of Rajab and Sha‘ban are two reprehensible innovations.”(Al-Sunan wa’l-Mubtada‘at, p. 144)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Fatni (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after the comments quoted above:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The common folk are so infatuated with this prayer that they stored up a lot of fuel for it and many evils resulted from it, and many transgressions are committed which we do not need to describe. (It is so bad that) the close friends of Allah feared His punishment and fled into the wilderness. The first time this prayer occurred was in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) in 448 AH. Zayd ibn Aslam said: We never saw any of our shaykhs or fuqaha saying that Laylat al-Bara-ah (15 Sha‘ban) had any superiority over other nights. Ibn Dihyah said: The hadiths about the prayer on Laylat al-Bara-ah are fabricated and one has an interruption in the isnad. Anyone who acts upon a report which is known to be false is a servant of the Shaytan.” (Tadhkirat al-Mawdu‘at by al-Fatni, p. 45)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Mawdu‘at by Ibn al-Jawzi, 2/127; al-Manar al-Munif fil Sahih wa’l-Da‘if by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 98; al-Fawaid al-Majmu'ah by al-Shawkani, p. 51&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Shab_e_Barat_in_Islam\">Shab e Barat in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>Some people use the word al-Sha‘baniyyah to refer to the last days of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13726\" target=\"_blank\">Sha‘ban</a> , and say, “These are the days of bidding farewell to food,” and they take advantage of these days to eat a lot before Ramadan begins. Some scholars say that this idea was originally taken from the Christians, who used to do that as their fasting period (Lent) approached.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, there is no celebration in Sha‘ban and there is no special act of worship to be performed in the middle of it or during the last days of the month. Doing that is an innovation that has been introduced into the religion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

As for bowing, glorify your Lord therein, and as for prostrating, strive in du`a, for it is deserving of a response (from your Lord).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (480) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade me to recite Quran when bowing and prostrating.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars are agreed that it is makrooh to recite Quran when bowing or prostrating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Majmoo’, 3/411; al-Mughni, 2/181&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wisdom behind that is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was said that the best pillar of prayer is standing and the best of dhikr is reciting Quran, so the best has been put with the best, and it is not allowed to put it with anything else, lest anyone think that it is equal to other kinds of dhikr. ‘Awn al-Ma’bood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was said that it is because the Quran is the noblest of speech, because it is the Word of Allah, and the position of bowing and prostration is one of humility and submission on the part of the worshipper, so it is more appropriate not to recite the Word of Allah in these two positions. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 5/338&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person recites a du`a that is mentioned in the Quran when prostrating, such as the words (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire” [al-Baqarah 2:201], there is nothing wrong with that, if the intention is to say du`a and not to recite Quran, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that which he intended.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1; Muslim, 1907.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Zarkashi said: It is makrooh when it is intended as recitation of Quran, but if it is intended as du`a and praise, then it is like someone who did Qunoot by reciting a verse. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Doing Qunoot by reciting a verse from the Quran is permissible and is not makrooh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 2/61&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 59)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person does Qunoot by reciting a verse which includes a du`a, then he has done Qunoot, but it is better to say the du`a as narrated in the Sunnah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This applies if he intends to say du`a when he recites the verse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Ibn ‘Allaan, 2/308&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: We know that it is not permissible to recite Quran when prostrating, but there are some verses which include du`as, such as the words, “Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:8]. What is the ruling on saying such du`as that are mentioned in the Quran, when prostrating?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: There is nothing wrong with that if it is done as a du`a and not as recitation of Quran.

      "question": "<p>In a hadeeth of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) it says: “Jumu’ah prayer is an obligatory duty for every Muslim except four.” Why is it that travellers not included among those for whom Jumu’ah prayer is waived in this hadeeth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      The hadeeth referred to in the question was narrated from       Taariq ibn Shihaab (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet       (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jumu’ah prayer is an       obligatory duty for every Muslim, to be offered in congregation, except       four: a slave who is owned, or woman, or a child, or one who is sick.”       Narrated by Abu Dawood (1067). Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’       (4/483): Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of the two       shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Ibn Rajab said in Fath al-Baari       (5/327): Its isnaad is saheeh. Ibn Katheer said in Irshaad al-Faqeeh       (1/190): Its isnaad is jayyid. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in      Saheeh al-Jaami’ (3111).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with     him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The     traveller is not obliged to pray Jumu’ah.” Al-Haafiz said in Buloogh al-Maraam:     Its isnaad is da’eef.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The exception of the traveller is also mentioned in a number     of hadeeths, including the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the     Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “There are     five for whom Jumu’ah is not obligatory: the woman, the traveller, the     slave, the child and the people of the wilderness.” It says in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id:     It was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat and its isnaad includes     Ibraaheem ibn Hammaad, who was classed as da’eef (weak) by al-Daaraqutni.     Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (He is) da’eef jiddan     (very weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is no secret that the shar’i rulings should be derived     from all of the hadeeths that were narrated concerning this specific     subject, and they should not be derived from only one hadeeth whilst     ignoring the rest of the hadeeths.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     mentioned a number, as we see in the hadeeth being asked about here, and     mentioning a number does not necessarily mean that it is limited to this     number. The aim may have been to make it easier to remember this hadeeth for     those who heard it. A similar example is the words of the Prophet (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him): “There are seven whom Allah will shade with     His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His…” By compiling all     the hadeeths which speak of this great matter (“Allah will shade them with     His shade”) it becomes clear that there are more than 20 such categories,     not only seven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We can see from the hadeeths that Jumu’ah is not obligatory     for six people: children, as there is consensus that Jumu’ah is not     obligatory for them; slaves, as there is consensus on this matter except for     Dawood; women, and there is consensus that it is not obligatory for them;     sick people; travellers, who are not obliged to attend it; and the sixth     category, which is the people of the wilderness.

      "title": "Types of Speech to Refrain from",
      "question": "<p>I know there are certain types of speech which we must refrain from, like the speech the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stayed away from; please could you expound on that for me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslim has to control his tongue and not speak unless he says something good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or else keep silent …”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he wants to speak, then if what he wants to say is good and he is confident that he will be rewarded for it, whether it is obligatory or praiseworthy, then let him speak, but if it does not seem to him that it is good and he will be rewarded for it, then let him refrain from speaking, whether he thinks it is haram (impermissible) or makrooh (disliked) or permissible. Based on this, it is recommended to refrain from saying permissible words and we are enjoined to avoid this, lest it lead us into something that is haram or makrooh, which is what happens in many cases or in most cases. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).’ [50:18]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Imam al-Shafi’i understood the hadeeth (narration) to mean that if a person wants to say something, he should think about it: if it seems to him that it will not do any harm, then he should speak, but if he thinks that it will do some harm or he thinks that this is most likely, then he should refrain from speaking.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to control our tongues in more than one hadeeth, such as that narrated by al-Tirmidhi from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation?’ He said, ‘Control your tongue, keep to your house and weep over your sin.’” Classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Tirmidhi also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’adh (may Allah be pleased with him), after teaching him some of the laws of Islam, “Shall I not tell you what is the foundation of all that?” I [Mu’adh] said: “Of course, O Prophet of Allah.” He took hold of his tongue and said, “Control this.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, will we be held responsible for what we say with it?” He said, “May your mother be bereft of you, O Mu’adh! Will the people be thrown into Hell on their faces or on their noses for anything other than the harvest of their tongues?” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>The hadeeth enjoins refraining from indulging in specific things, because this is something that is of no benefit to a person, and indeed it may cause him a great deal of harm in his spiritual and worldly affairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If my Companions are mentioned, then keep quiet; if the stars are mentioned, then keep quiet; and if the divine decree is mentioned, then keep quiet.” (Narrated by al-Tabarani and classed as saheeh / authentic).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadeeth indicates that it is not permissible for a person to speak badly of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that he should keep quiet about the disputes that occurred among them, because speaking badly of them or criticizing them implies that one is rejecting what Allah said about them in the Quran, where He praised them by saying (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhajiroon (emigrants) and the Ansar (helpers) and also those who followed them exactly (in faith). Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [9:100]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) good pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers).”</p>\n<p>[48:29]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is how Allah has described them in His Book, so no doubt they are of just character and are the best and greatest of mankind. So no one hates them but a hypocrite and no one loves them but a believer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“One of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah (followers of prophetic tradition) is that they think and say nothing to criticize the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as Allah has described them in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘And those who came after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.’</p>\n<p>[59:10]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And they obey the command of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ‘Do not curse my Companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to spend the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not reach the status of one of them, nor even come half way.’ (Agreed upon).” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 3/152.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Zar’ah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you see a man criticizing any one of the sahabah (Companions), then know that he is a heretic, because the Quran is true, and the Messenger is true, and what he brought is true, and no one conveyed all of that to us but the sahabah. So whoever criticizes them means, in effect, to say that the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) are false, so it is more appropriate that he should be criticized and ruled to be a heretic who is misguided.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sawa’iq al-Muhriqah ‘ala Ahl al-Rafd wa’l-Dalal wa’l-Zandaqah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the second part of the hadeeth, which enjoins refraining from speaking about the stars, what is referred to by that – and Allah knows best – is seeking guidance by the stars concerning matters that are unseen, as the people of the jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) used to do by means of astrology, such as using the movement of heavenly bodies to indicate when certain earthly events would occur, such as the blowing of the wind, rainfall, changes in prices, and other matters which they claimed to know from the movements of heavenly bodies. They used to say that whoever got married under a particular star, then such and such would happen to him, or whoever traveled under a particular star, such and such would happen to him, and whoever was born under a particular star would be lucky or unlucky, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(See Kitab al-Tawheed by al-Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan. See also Fatawa al-‘Aqeedah by al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, where he makes some very useful comments).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the third part of the hadeeth, which refers to refraining from speaking about the divine decree (al-qadar), Abu Ja’far al-Tahhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The divine decree is a secret known which Allah has hidden from His creation. No angel who is close to Him and no Prophet whom He sent knows that. Pursuing such matters only leads to failure and deprivation of the mercy of Allah, and it leads to injustice, so beware of looking into the matter, thinking about it and wondering about it. Allah has kept knowledge of His decree from His slaves, and has forbidden them to pursue the matter, as He says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.’</p>\n<p>[21:23]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So whoever questions what Allah does has rejected the ruling of the Book, and whoever rejects the ruling of the Book is a kafir (disbeliever).”&nbsp;Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhawiyyah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the Muslim has to submit to Allah in all His affairs, and know that whatever happens to him could never have missed him, and what misses him could never have happened to him. There is a lot that may be said on this topic. May Allah bless the man who believes in the will and decree of Allah without indulging in philosophical discussion about the matter.</p>\n",

I and my brother pay the rent of the apartment.<br />\nInsha'Allah we are going to move to a rented house which will be bigger and the rent will be payed by me and my brother.

      "answer": "<p>There is no harm in you and your wife living in one house with the rest of the family members you mentioned. All that you have to be careful about is that your wife does not go out in front of your brother or be alone with him in the house, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade non-mahrams (unrelated men) to enter upon women. He said: \"Beware of entering upon women.\" One of the Sahaabah said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah, what about the brother-in-law?\" He said: \"The brother-in-law is death!\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330).</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"What is referred to in the hadeeth is all the husbands (male) relatives apart from his father and sons. People customarily take the matter of a man being alone with his brothers wife as being of little consequence; to indicate the seriousness of the matter, it was likened to death. Indeed, one should be more cautious about the brother-in-law than about a stranger. The phrase \"the brother-in-law is death\" may have a number of meanings:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to disaster if a sin is committed, or may spell divorce for the woman if her husband cannot contain his jealousy;</li>\n<li>Or: Beware of being alone with a non-mahram woman fear this as you fear death.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>All this stems from Islams keenness to protect households, to avoid evil and to preserve marriages in the best possible way.

      "title": "Does chatting between the sexes on social media sites come under the heading of khulwah that is forbidden?",
      "question": "<p>Does chatting between the sexes on social media sites come under the heading of khulwah that is forbidden?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No man should be alone with a woman unless there is a mahram present.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5233) and Muslim (1341).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;What is meant by khulwah in this hadith is physically being alone together.</p>\n<p>The reason for this prohibition is that it is thought that this khulwah will lead to falling into what is prohibited (haraam), because it enables the Shaytaan to instill such temptation. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) referred to that when he said: “Indeed, no man is alone with a woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2165); he said: This is a hasan saheeh ghareeb hadith with this isnad. al-Haakim said in al-Mustadrak (1/114): It is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim], and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel (6/215).</p>\n<p>Al-Minnaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“but the Shaytaan is the third one present” by means of his waswasah (whispers), stirring up of desire, dispelling of modesty, and encouragement to commit sin, until he tempts them to commit the act of intercourse or that which is less than it of precursors that will soon lead to it. This hadith proves that it (khulwah) is haraam.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer (3/78).</p>\n<p>The prohibition on being alone with a non-mahram woman comes under the heading of barring ways that lead to shameful deeds. This is one of the fundamental principles of our religious teaching.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that anything that is a means that leads to fitnah (temptation) is not permissible, because the means that lead to mischief must be barred, if that is not outweighed by a greater interest.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (15/419).</p>\n<p>If a man talks to a non-mahram woman in a private chat on social media websites – even if it does not come under the heading of the khulwah discussed by the fuqaha’ – this is still a means that leads to fitnah (temptation) and mischief, so it is disallowed for that reason.</p>\n<p>If looking, shaking hands and the like are forbidden, so as to block the means of being tempted by the woman, even if there is no khulwah, then disallowing private conversation, especially among young people and those who are thought most likely to be vulnerable to temptation, also comes under that heading.</p>\n<p>There are many religious texts which forbid seeking enjoyment in talking to a non-mahram woman and finding pleasure in listening to her voice and looking at her; this is regarded as a type of zina.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that “Allah has decreed for the son of Adam his share of zina, which he will inevitably get. The zina of the eyes is looking and the zina of the tongue is speaking. The heart wishes and hopes, and the private part confirms that or denies it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6243), Muslim (2657). Ahmad (27430) added: “And the zina of the ears is listening.”</p>\n<p>With some people, the matter may go as far as the Shaytaan tempting them to the extent that they take off their clothes for one another (exchanging nude photos etc).</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the Shaytaan has many traps into which people fall, such as mischief, desires and temptations. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left behind me among the people any fitnah (trial) that is more harmful to men than women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5096) and Muslim (2741).</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe”</p>\n<p>[al-A‘raaf 7:27].</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>So Allah has forbidden the children of Adam to be tempted by the temptation of the Shaytaan, as their parents were tempted, by disobeying Allah and obeying the Shaytaan in going against the commands and prohibitions of Allah.</p>\n<p>He stripped&nbsp; the parents of their clothing, and in like manner he may strip their offspring of the garment of piety (taqwa) and their physical garments, so that they show their private parts.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Istiqaamah (2/170).</p>\n<p>To sum up, for a man to chat with a non-mahram woman on social media websites, in a chat room away from other visitors and subscribers, does not come under the heading of the khulwah that is forbidden,</p>\n<p>But it is disallowed because of what it involves of temptation and the likelihood of mischief.</p>\n<p>So Muslim men and women should avoid such contact, unless it is for a greater religious purpose, such as asking questions of scholars, or it is for a legitimate worldly purpose, in which case the conversation should be only as much as is needed, without unnecessary chitchat and going off topic.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Who are the siddeeqoon? What are their characteristics?",
      "question": "<p>Who are the siddeeqoon [the strong and true in faith, or the first and foremost to believe] according to the Qur’an and Sunnah? What are their characteristics and virtues? How can a person become one of them?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>High ambition, sublime aims and the desire to attain high status and draw closer to Allah by doing righteous deeds and refraining from that which is forbidden are all things that are prescribed and encouraged in Islam. Al-Bukhaari (7423) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws, for it is the middle of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise; above it is the Throne of the Most Gracious, and from it flow the rivers of Paradise.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with the Muslim praying to be among the righteous close friends of Allah, or the sincere siddeeqoon.</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The close friends of Allah, may He be exalted, are the pious ones among His creation who fear Him. Everyone who is pious is a close friend of Allah, but that close friendship varies according to the level of a person’s faith and piety or fear of Allah. The highest status thereof after that of the Prophets is the status of the siddeeqoon; those who attain this status are the siddeeqoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And whoso obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!”&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:69]</p>\n<p>“And those who believe in (the Oneness of) Allah and His Messengers, they are the Siddeeqoon (i.e. those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them), and the martyrs with their Lord, they shall have their reward and their light”&nbsp;[al-Hadeed 57:19].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Khaazin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The siddeeq (explained here as one of “those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them” is the one who speaks the truth. The siddeeqoon are those followers of the Messengers who followed their path after they were gone, until they met them. And it was said that the siddeeq is the one who believes in the entire religion, to the extent that he has no doubt at all about his faith.\"(Tafseer al-Khaazin&nbsp; 1/397)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The word siddeeq is a grammatically intensive form which indicates a high level of belief. The siddeeq is the one who confirms with his actions what he says with his tongue. And it was said that they (the siddeeqoon) are the best of the followers of the Prophets who were the first of them to believe, such as Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi 5/272)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The siddeeqoon are those who reached the highest levels of faith, righteous deeds, beneficial knowledge and true certainty.\"(Tafseer as-Sa‘di&nbsp; p. 841)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The highest level of sincerity is that of the siddeeq; it is perfect submission to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), accompanied by perfect sincerity towards the One Who sent him.\"(Madaarij as-Saalikeen&nbsp; 2/258)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2424\" target=\"_blank\">2424</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever follows the Siddeeqoon in their path of sincerity, belief, piety and righteousness will be one of them and will be gathered with them (on the Day of Resurrection). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And whoso obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!”&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:69].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever wants to strive to reach this status and for Allah to bestow it upon him, and to be one of its people, must have perfect sincerity in word and deed, and fear Allah privately and in public.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/107283\" target=\"_blank\">107283</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She said to her husband: You are haraam to me until the Day of Judgement",
      "question": "<p>A woman swore an oath to her husband and said to him: You are haraam to me until the Day of Judgement. What is the religious ruling on that? What is required to get out of her oath? Will she be brought to account for that?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a wife says to her     husband, You are haraam for me, or you are haraam until the Day of     Judgement, that does not result in zihaar or talaaq, because zihaar and     talaaq can only be done by the husband. Rather it comes under the heading of     making what is halaal haraam, such as stating that some kind of clothing or     food is haraam. When breaking this oath she must offer expiation for     breaking an oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Prophet! Why do you     forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to you, seeking to     please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;Allaah has already     ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths”</p>\n<p>[al-Tahreem 66:1-2]</p>\n<p>So Allaah has described     making haraam something that is halaal as a kind of oath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The expiation for breaking     an oath is freeing a slave, or feeding or clothing ten poor persons. The one     who cannot do any of these things must fast three days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She only breaks the oath if     her husband has intercourse with her when she is willing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah     have mercy on him) was asked: If a woman says to her husband, If you do such     and such you are haraam for me like my father, what is the ruling on that?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: If a woman says     she is haraam for her husband or she likens him to one of her mahrams, that     comes under the same ruling as an oath, and does not come under the ruling     on zihaar, because zihaar can only be done by husbands to wives according to     the text of the Qur’aan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In that case the woman must     offer expiation for breaking an oath, which is to feed ten poor persons,     giving each poor person half a saa’ of the local staple food, which is     equivalent to approximately one and a half kilograms, giving them either     lunch or dinner; or clothing them in garments that are acceptable for     praying in, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allaah will not punish     you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your     deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen     (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your     own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford     (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the     oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa'idah 5:89].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman makes haraam     that which Allaah has permitted, it comes under the same ruling as an oath.     The same applies to a man making haraam that which Allaah has forbidden,     except his wife, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Prophet! Why do you     forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to you, seeking to     please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;Allaah has already     ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And Allaah is your     Mawlaa (Lord, or Master, or Protector) and He is the All‑Knower, the     All‑Wise”</p>\n<p>[al-Tahreem 66:1-2]</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa     Islamiyyah (3/301).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wife must repent to     Allaah for saying this, because making haraam what is halaal is not     permissible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should he cancel the investment certificates after a fatwa was issued stating that it is prohibited to invest in them? And what is the ruling on previous profit?",
      "question": "<p>I used to deduct a portion of profits from the Islamic bank where I put my money, in order to avoid dubious transactions that could be subject to error. Then the fatwa concerning that changed, which meant that I should put my money in a current account. 1.. What is the ruling on what remains of these profits that were previously given to me? Do I have to calculate what I earned in the past and give it to the needy, with the aim of getting rid of it, or should I do that from the date that I came to know of the change in the fatwa? 2.. What should I do with the investment certificates? Should I wait until they expire and not renew them? Or should I cancel them immediately, and bear the resulting losses for not completing the stated period?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If the Islamic bank put some of its money into bonds or riba-based treasury bills, or it invests the money in organized tawarruq [a trick whereby the bank pays for an item on behalf of a customer, then asks the customer to pay back more than the original price, to be paid in instalments. The customer then sells the item himself, or asks the bank to sell it on his behalf, in order to obtain cash], it is not permissible to invest money in it, because according to the investment contract, the bank is representing itself and acting as a proxy for the investors, so the sin of the haraam transactions it is doing will also be on them, and the sin is not waived from them by getting rid of the haraam interest.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Regarding the riba-based interest that you received <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2492\" target=\"_blank\">before coming to know of the prohibition</a> , you may make use of it, whether you spent it already or you still have it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding riba (interpretation of the meaning): <em>{</em><em>But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past</em><em>} [al-Baqarah 2:275]</em>.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What there is no doubt about, in our view, is that whatever he received on the basis of a misunderstanding or ignorance, he may keep what is past, without a doubt, as is indicated by the Qur’an and Sunnah and the correct scholarly view.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Tafseer Aayaat ashkalat ‘ala Katheer min al-‘Ulama’</em> (2/592).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he was not aware that this is prohibited, he may keep everything that he acquired, and he does not have to do anything; or if he was confused by a fatwa issued by a scholar which stated that it is not prohibited, he does not have to pay anything. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {<em>So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah</em><em>} [al-Baqarah 2:275]</em>.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri</em> (67/19).</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we learn from the verse is that whatever a person receives of ribe (interest) before coming to know of the prohibition is permissible for him, on condition that he repents and stops engaging in that transaction.&nbsp;End quote from <em>Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah</em> (3/377).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>You must stop investing in this bank, whether that is through an investment account or through limited-time certificates, even if that results in losing some money, so as to flee from dealing with riba and in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><em>{</em><em>O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.</em></p>\n<p><em>And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged}&nbsp;[</em><em>al-Baqarah 2:278-279]</em>.</p>\n<p>And Muslim narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

(See also Fath Al-Bari by Ibn Rajab, 2/104)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/84314\" target=\"_blank\">On the night of the Isra’</a> , one and a half years before the Hijrah, Allah enjoined upon His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the five daily prayers, and explained that there were conditions and essential parts and other matters having to do with them, bit by bit.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7/164)</p>\n<p>Then Jibril (peace be upon him) came down and taught the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9940\" target=\"_blank\">the times of the prayers</a> :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (522) and Muslim (611) narrated from Ibn Shihab that `Umar ibn `Abd Al-`Aziz delayed the prayer one day. `Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr entered upon him and told him that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah delayed the prayer one day when he was in Kufah, and Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari entered upon him and said: What is this, O Mughirah? Do you not know that Jibril came down and prayed, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed. Then he said: This is what has been enjoined upon me. `Umar said to `Urwah: Think what you are narrating, O `Urwah! Is Jibril the one who taught the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1092\" target=\"_blank\">the times of the prayers?</a> `Urwah said: That is what Bashir ibn Abi Mas`ud used to narrate from his father.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nasa’i (526) narrated that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Jibril (peace be upon him) came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when the sun had passed its zenith and said: Get up, O Muhammad. That was when the sun had passed the meridian. Then he waited until the (length of) a man’s shadow was equal to his height, then he came to him for `Asr and said: Get up, O Muhammad, and pray `Asr. Then he waited until the sun set, then he came to him and said: Get up and pray Maghrib. So he got up and prayed it when the sun had set fully. Then he waited until the twilight had disappeared, then he came and said: Get up and pray `Isha’, so he got up and prayed it… In this Hadith it says: He (i.e., Jibril) said: The period between two of these two times is the time to pray. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>`Abd Ar-Razzaq narrated in his Musannaf (1773) and Ibn Ishaq narrated in his Sirah – as it says in Fath Al-Bari (2/286) – that this happened on the morning after the night in which prayer was made obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“(The scholars) did not differ concerning the fact that Jibril (peace be upon him) came down on the morning following the night of the Isra’, when the sun passed its zenith, and taught the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the prayer and its timings.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Jibril’s explanation of the timings of the prayer came on the morning following the night of the Isra’.” (Sharh Al-`Umdah, 4/148)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the five daily prayers were first made obligatory, each prayer was two rak`ahs, then after the Hijrah, that was confirmed in the case of travel, and two rak`ahs were added for those who are not travelling, except Maghrib, which remained as it was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (3935) and Muslim (685) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Prayer was enjoined with two Rak`ahs, then when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) migrated, it was enjoined with four Rak`ahs, but prayer whilst travelling remained as it had originally been.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_did_the_Muslims_pray_before_prayer_was_made_obligatory\"><strong>How did the Muslims pray before prayer was made obligatory?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions used to pray before the five daily prayers were made obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (27/52-53):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12305\" target=\"_blank\">Prayer</a> was originally enjoined in Makkah at the beginning of Islam, because there are Makkan verses that were revealed at the beginning of the Prophet’s mission that encourage praying. As for the five daily prayers in the form that is well-known, they were made obligatory <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/203789\" target=\"_blank\">on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that prayer was made obligatory at the beginning, two Rak`ahs in the morning and two Rak`ahs in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fath:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“A number of scholars are of the view that before the Isra’ there was no obligatory prescribed prayer, but prayers were offered at night, without any number of Rak`ahs being specified. Al-Harbi was of the view that prayer was made obligatory, two rak`ahs in the morning and two rak`ahs in the afternoon. Ash-Shafi`i narrated from some of the scholars that prayer at night was obligatory, then it was abrogated by the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {So, recite you of the Quran as much as may be easy for you} [Al-Muzammil 73:20]. So it became obligatory to pray for part of the night. Then that was abrogated by the five daily prayers.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Before the Isra’, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) definitely used to pray, as did his Companions, but there is a scholarly difference of opinion as to whether any kind of prayer was made obligatory before the five daily prayers or not. It was said that what was obligatory at first was prayer before sunrise and prayer before sunset. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting} [Ta-Ha 20:130], and similar verses.” (See also Tafsir Ibn `Atiyyah (1/204); At-Tahrir wat Tanwir by Ibn `Ashur (24/75)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

I was wondering if you have the time to email me personally and just help through this?<br />\n<br />\nPlease, please, please get back to me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some preliminaries that we should talk to you     about, and we hope that you will pay attention to what we say to you:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1.</p>\n<p>    We recognize that you are living in a country that is     permissive in moral terms, in which things are allowed that are forbidden in     Islam, and things have reached a state where they -- both males and females     -- ride bicycles in the street in front of people when they are virtually     naked. People are undoubtedly affected by their environment, hence there is     a stern warning against settling among the mushrikeen and those who are     morally bankrupt. We think that if you were living in a decent, conservative     environment, you would not be feeling this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2.</p>\n<p>    We are sorry to see that in your question that you went     beyond asking questions in seeking to understand, to the extent of impugning     the laws and wisdom of Allah, and differentiating between faith in Allah,     may He be exalted, and the laws of Islam. The laws of Islam came from Allah     in the first place; they come from Him and from nowhere else. So it is     better to phrase such objections in the form of questions that are aimed at     removing doubt, and not in this style or form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3.</p>\n<p>    You have mixed up the rulings of Islam and the actions of     Muslims. The laws of Islam are pure and were prescribed by Allah, may He be     exalted, to set straight the affairs of people and countries. Whatever the     Muslims do that is contrary to the laws of their Lord can only be attributed     to them, not to their religion. The religion of Allah does not permit males     to drink alcohol or to make friends with non-mahram women or to commit zina     (fornication or adultery). How can you attribute these evil deeds and major     sins that are committed by the misguided youth to the laws of Allah, and     claim that He permits that to them [males] and forbids them to females? You     are mistaken and confused. You have made a mistake by attributing their     actions to Islam and you are confused in your belief that these actions are     permissible for males and not females.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You said some objectionable words in your question, which are     very wrong and pose a danger to your religious commitment, so you have to     repent from them and regret them. Among the worst of them are your words,     “why do people say that Islam is the greatest religion on earth if it’s so     unfair and cruel?” These are words which, if they were spoken by one who     understood their meanings, they would be tantamount to apostasy in his case.     They imply impugning of Allah, may He be exalted, which is a serious matter.     Perhaps your excuse is that you were confused between the laws of Allah and     the actions of some Muslims. Islam is the religion of Allah and it is what     He has prescribed. It is what He revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings     and peace of Allah upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Truly, the religion with Allaah is Islam”</p>\n<p>    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:19]</p>\n<p>    “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will     never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”</p>\n<p>    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Accusing Islam of being unjust and cruel is one of the     falsest of falsehoods. Allah says, negating the first accusation     (interpretation of the meaning): </p>\n<p>    “Verily, Allaah enjoins Al‑‘Adl (i.e. justice and     worshipping none but Allaah Alone — Islamic Monotheism) and Al‑Ihsân [i.e.     to be patient in performing your duties to Allaah, totally for Allaah’s sake     and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet    صلىالله عليه وسلم in a perfect manner],     and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allaah has ordered you to     give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of     help), and forbids Al‑Fahshâ’ (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual     acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false     witness, to kill a life without right), and Al‑Munkar (i.e. all that is     prohibited by Islamic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every     kind of evil deeds), and Al‑Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He     admonishes you, that you may take heed”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nahl 16:90].</p>\n<p>    And He says, negating the second accusation:</p>\n<p>    “Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make     things difficult for you”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:185].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?”</p>\n<p>    [Yoonus 10:32].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Messenger of Allah (sa) said: “Allaah did not send me to     make things hard for people in the hope that they would make mistakes,     rather He sent me to teach and make things easy.” Narrated by Muslim, 1478.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with     him) said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (sa): Which religion is     most beloved to Allah? He said: “al-Haneefiyyah al-Samhah (easy     monotheism).” Narrated by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The basic principle with regard to the commands and     prohibitions is that there is no differentiation between males and females     with regard to them. There is no need to point out that this applies to all     rulings, but we find that in the case of some prohibitions, Allah mentions     both sexes, and this confirms what we say, which is that there is basically     no difference between the sexes, especially with regard to things that are     forbidden in Islam. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (i)</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off     (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which     they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah. And Allaah is     All‑Powerful, All‑Wise”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:38].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (ii)</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning):</p>\n<p>    “The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them     with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a     punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day.     And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.”</p>\n<p>    [al-Noor 24:2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (iii)</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking     at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual     acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do.</p>\n<p>    31.&nbsp;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from     looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal     sexual acts)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Noor 24:30. 31].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, we should tell you that there are some things that     are forbidden for men but permissible for women, because they are     appropriate for women’s nature but arenot appropriate for men. It was     narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah,     may He be glorified and exalted, has permitted silk and gold to the females     of my ummah, and has forbidden them to the males.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Ahmad (19184) and al-Nasaa’i (5265); classed as     saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We should also tell you that the differences in the physical     makeup of both genders may dictate variation in some rulings, but in the     context of reward and status with Allah, this variation becomes     insignificant and each person will be rewarded in accordance with his effort     and his situation; no one will be wronged and no deed will be undervalued;     no one will be brought to account for something they did not do. Allah, may     He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female,     and is a (true) believer [in the Oneness of Allaah (Muslim)], such will     enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a Naqeera     (speck on the back of a date stone), will be done to them”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:124]</p>\n<p>    “Whosoever does an evil deed, will not be requited except     the like thereof; and whosoever does a righteous deed, whether male or     female and is a true believer (in the Oneness of Allaah), such will enter     Paradise, where they will be provided therein (with all things in abundance)     without limit”</p>\n<p>    [Ghaafir 40:60].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is this sufficient for you to realise how wrong you are in     thinking that haraam things are permissible for males and not females? From     this you will realise that your saying “why is it okay for a boy to go out     and get so drunk he can’t walk properly and sleep with a million different     girls?” has no basis in truth. Alcohol and zina (fornication) are major sins     and no differentiation is made with regard to them between males and     females; both of them -- if they do these things -- incur the burden of sin     and deserve the prescribed punishment. If many people differentiate in this     matter by allowing their sons to do this but not their daughters, that is     due to the temptation of the Shaytaan and does not stem from the laws of the     Most Merciful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is there any reason or wisdom, is there any justice or     fairness in anything if you regard the deeds of evildoers and immoral people     and the filth of addicts and fornicators as the criteria to judge the     religion of the Lord of the Worlds??&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your saying, “some Muslims seem to think it’s okay to marry a     fifteen-year-old girl to some thirty-year-old man she's never met before,     why is that okay?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    These words are unfair and contrary to the reality that you     want to judge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please take note of what we are going to tell you:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1. </p>\n<p>    A marriage can never take place between a thirty-year-old man     and a fifteen year old girl, between that girl and a man of whatever age she     wants, except with her agreement. What harm will it do you if a man of that     age proposes marriage to you when you are at the age you are at, then you     accept it and want to marry him, and you tell your guardian to go ahead with     that? What if she is thirty years old and he is forty-five? So what? The     fact that she did not accept this husband before does not mean anything. The     matter is for her to decide, if she wants that and agrees to it after asking     about him and making enquiries about him; and if she wants she can reject     him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2. </p>\n<p>    Moreover, if she has met him before -- as happens among those     who act contrary to sharee‘ah and have haraam relationships -- that does not     mean that their marriage will be happy; rather most of what you hear about     husbands beating their wives, wives killing their husbands, divorce,     separation and marital infidelity -- all of that, in the society in which     you are living and others like it -- happens between spouses who knew one     another and met one another before marriage, and in many cases had a child     or children. Did that meeting before marriage benefit them at all?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2.</p>\n<p>    As a thirty-year-old man can marry a fifteen-year-old girl,     so too a man of twenty can marry a woman of thirty or even forty. So what?     What matters is the fact that both agree and consent to the marriage. What     harm does it do if there is a difference in age between the spouses? Is     there any marriage that was happier than the marriages of the Prophet     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Khadeejah and ‘Aa’ishah? His     marriage to Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her) took place when she     was nearly twice his age, and his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah took place when he     was much older than her, but they were among the most successful of     marriages on earth. So when did the difference in ages between the spouses     in and of itself have a negative impact on the marriage?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fifthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your saying “Why is it that when a Muslim girl strikes out on     her own and wants to do something with her life she can’t because Islam is     holding her back?” is not correct, because Islam does not prevent a woman     from going out on her own to the mosque or to the marketplace or to the     houses of her family, relatives and neighbours. Rather what is forbidden is     for her to travel on her own without a mahram, and the accompaniment of a     mahram when travelling is only prescribed in order to protect her from those     who would mess with her and cause her harm. Perhaps you see in the country     in which you live that women are not safe if they go out alone to the     marketplace or to work, and they are aware that the “wolves” of the streets     are waiting for them. When Islam prescribes something that is aimed at     protecting women, that is not mistreatment of them; rather it is because     Islam holds them in high esteem and shows great respect to them, as well as     paying attention to their weakness and their need for someone else who will     protect and guard them against evildoers who would do them harm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, every wise person realises that women need     protection and care more then men, and the need to protect girls against     going astray or falling victim to aggression is even greater. If she loses     her virginity or becomes pregnant or her honour is physically tarnished,     that may affect her and her future, and it may be difficult for her to     conceal it. As for boys, there is no differentiation between a boy and girl     with regard to the shar‘i punishment in this world or the recompense in the     Hereafter, but a boy -- at least -- can conceal his misdemeanour, and its     effect and shame are not apparent in his case. Moreover, he is not the one     for whom aggression is feared; he is the one who is the aggressor and the     girl is the target and victim. So which of them is more deserving of being     protected, guarded, watched over and cared for? “if you but knew” [Nooh     71:4].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sixthly:</p>\n<p>    As for your saying “why is it not okay for a Muslim woman to     marry a non-Muslim man when she's fallen in love with him but it's perfectly     fine for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim lady?”, this is a very strange     comment! Can these be the words of one who believes in Allah, may He be     exalted, as her Lord and describes herself as a Muslim? Where is the faith     in the name of Allah al-Hakam (the Most Wise), and where is the belief in     your Lord’s attribute of wisdom? Where is the submission to His commands and     prohibitions? Now you want any Muslim woman who falls in love with a     Buddhist or Hindu man to be able to marry him! Do you believe that Islam     allows men to marry female idolaters, Communists or Buddhists? This is a     mistaken notion. It is not permissible for Muslim men to marry kaafir women,     except those who are Jews or Christians; it is not permissible for them to     marry women of any other religions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of a Muslim woman, it is haraam for her to marry     anyone of any other religion apart from Islam. This is a matter on which     there is scholarly consensus and there are no differences concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is very strange that you want a Muslim woman be able to     marry any kaafir she falls in love with, whilst many kaafirs do not allow     their daughters to marry Muslim men even if they fall in love with them!     Buddhists and Hindus do not give their daughters in marriage to Muslims.     Indeed there are some Christian denominations who do not marry one another!     How did it occur to you that Islam does not take care of Muslim women and     allows them to marry men of any religion, so that could lead to them being     driven away from their religion?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please see the answer to question number    <a href=\"/en/answers/83736\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">83736</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Seventhly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to your saying “why do the men get to choose who     they want to marry but sometimes woman gets no say in it at all? Why is it     so unfair?” your mistake is very clear and obvious. In fact the woman may     choose just as the man may choose; in fact her right to choose is greater     than his. The woman who receives marriage proposals can choose whoever she     wants and reject all the others. In fact she may choose a man who suits her,     whereas it may not be easy for a man to propose to more than one or two. All     the choices made by men in fact create choices for the woman, because she     has the right to refuse him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The tradition is for the woman to be makhtoobah (proposed to)     and not khaatibah (the one who proposes); for her to be mankoohah (the one     who is married) and not naahikah (one who marries); for her to be matloobah     (the one who is sought) not taalibah (the one who seeks). This is something     that is deeply rooted in the nature of the sons of Adam and indeed other     living beings: the female is usually the one who is sought.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Despite that, there is no reason in sharee‘ah, if a woman     likes a man, for her not to express her wish to marry him. But that should     not be done in an appropriate manner. So she should not propose to him or be     the one who marries him; rather he is the one who proposes and she is the     one who is proposed to; he is the one who marries and she is the one who is     married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Eighthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Finally, you should understand that Islam honour woman as a     daughter, a mother and a wife: it protects her rights that have been taken     from her. In its laws it pays attention to woman’s weakness and emotional     nature. So it prescribes for her that which will protect her honour and     dignity. What you see of loss of honour and transgression against women in     the form of assault and rape is only because of the bad conduct of men who     have lost all mercy and compassion, and who have lost all sense that Allah     is always watching them; it is also because of women showing their     adornments and being heedless about mixing, shaking hands, working and     corresponding with men. If women adhered to the laws of Allah in their     clothing and by not mixing with men or travelling alone, and if they adhered     to Islamic guidelines on talking to men and looking at them, a great deal of     evil and mischief in society would come to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no doubt that allowing women to mix freely with men     is the basis of all calamities and evils, and it is one of the greatest     causes of bringing punishment upon the entire community. It is also one of     the causes of corruption in both public and private affairs. And mixing of     men with women is a cause of many immoral actions and zina, and it is one of     the causes of widespread death and ongoing plagues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah, p. 405&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please also see the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/40405\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">40405</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Our advice to you is to beware of the tricks of the Shaytaan,     to venerate your Lord, may He be exalted, be proud of your religion and     express your appreciation of the Prophet of Islam (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him). You should understand that life is not sex, such that     you should focus only on that issue. Islam is all great and its rulings are     all in the interests of both individuals and societies at all times and in     all places. Wise people in the West are entering the religion of Allah in     crowds, not in order to flatter anyone, but because of what they see of the     greatness of its laws and its suitability to all times and places. These     wise people differentiate between what they know of Islam and what they see     of the actions of some Muslims. So think again about what you said and take     another look at your verdict on Islam: you will see the greatness of this     religion and that you are enjoying a blessing of which millions of people     are deprived.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikun will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.” [Al-Bayyinah 98:6]</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies without having believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” (Narrated by Muslim, 153)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ill-Mannered_conduct_towards_Allah\">Ill-Mannered conduct towards Allah</span></h3>\n<p>The point is not whether <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/198330\" target=\"_blank\">their morals are good</a> , rather the point is whether they submit to Allah and obey his commands. Do you not see the Magians [Zoroastrians] or the Buddhists, for example, who worship fire or idols instead of Allah, and they do not worship Allah or submit to Him alone, and the Christians who say that God has a son, and other Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah). They are being ill-mannered towards Allah, and insulting and reviling Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says, `The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: Allah has taken to Himself a son, while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4974)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So how can their morals be good when they are so ill-mannered towards Allah, even though Allah has given them hearing and sight, and has made everything easy for them, and has sent His Messengers to them and revealed His Books to them, and bestowed His blessings upon them, so it is His right that they should thank Him and not be ungrateful to Him or disbelieve in Him. If they do not do that then they deserve His punishment and wrath. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and your Lord treats no one with injustice.” [Al-Kahf 18:49]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_fate_of_the_children_of_disbelieversnbsp\">The fate of the children of disbelievers&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/6496\" target=\"_blank\">situation of their children who die when still young</a> , Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz was asked about that and he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/118103\" target=\"_blank\">If one who is not yet accountable dies among non-Muslim parents</a> , then he comes under the same rulings as them in this world, so he should not be washed and the funeral prayer should not be offered for him, and he should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But in the Hereafter his case is referred to Allah. It was narrated in an authentic report that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about the children of the Mushrikin he said: “Allah knows best what they would have done.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1384) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars were of the view that Allah’s knowledge about them will be made manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be tested, as <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98714\" target=\"_blank\">will the people who lived during the Fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If they do what they are told to do then they will enter Paradise, and if they disobey then they will enter Hell. There are authentic Hadiths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which say that the people who lived during the Fatrah (interval between two Prophets) will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. These are <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1244\" target=\"_blank\">the people whom the call of the Messengers did not reach</a> and those who come under a similar ruling, such as the children of the Mushrikin, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).” [Al-Isra’ 17:15]</p>\n<p>This is the most correct view among the various opinions concerning the people who lived during the Fatrah and others whom the call did not reach, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim, and a number of the earlier and later generations.

      "question": "<p>Is learning the fiqh of buying and selling and financial transactions obligatory (fard ‘ayn – an individual obligation) for everyone who engages in buying and selling, such as a pharmacist and representatives of pharmaceutical companies?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the Muslim understands that the purpose and aim of his being created in this world is to adhere to the laws of Allah, and to worship Allah by doing so, then he will also understand that it is essential for him to learn the rulings of Allah’s laws and learn what his duties are. That is because what is needed in order to do what is obligatory is also obligatory. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20092\" target=\"_blank\">Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim</a> .” (Narrated by Ibn Majah (224) and classed as hasan because of its many isnads and corroborating reports by al-Mazzi, al-Zarkashi, al-Suyuti, al-Sakhaawi, al-Dhahabi, al-Manawi, and al-Zarqani. It is also in Sahih Ibn Majah by al-Albani.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars have stated that the meaning of this hadith is sahih.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“But its meaning is sahih in their opinion, even though they differed somewhat concerning it.\" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm&nbsp; 1/53)</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said something similar in al-Mathurat (p. 287), as did Ibn al-Qayyim in Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah (1/480).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The scholars are unanimously agreed that acquiring some types of knowledge is an individual obligation, which each person must learn for himself, and acquiring other types of knowledge is a communal obligation – if some people acquire it then the obligation of others is waived.\" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi&nbsp; 1/56)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have described the knowledge which must be learned on an individual basis, and they have spoken of the amount of knowledge which each Muslim must acquire. They said that this includes learning the rulings on selling for those who engage in trade, so that they will not do anything haram or fall into riba (usury) without realizing. There are reports from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) which support that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “No one should sell in our marketplace except those who have knowledge of Islam.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 487, who said: it is hasan gharib. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever engages in trade before learning will fall into riba, then fall into riba.” (Mughni al-Muhtaj 2/22)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What all people must learn is that which they cannot afford to be ignorant of such as bearing witness verbally and believing in the heart that Allah is One and has no partner or associate, and that His names and attributes are eternal; He has no beginning and no end, and He has risen over the Throne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, and that all people will be resurrected after death to be rewarded or punished for their deeds, and that the Quran is the Word of Allah, and that what is in it is true. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should affirm that the five daily prayers are obligatory, and he must know what is essential for the performance of the prayer, such as purification and other rulings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should affirm that fasting Ramadan is obligatory, and he must know what invalidates the fast and what is essential for the completion of the fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he has enough wealth and is physically able to perform Hajj, he must know what zakah is due on, and when it becomes due, and on how much it is due. He must perform Hajj once in his life if he has the means.</p>\n<p>And there are things that he must know in general and he has no excuse for not knowing: such as the fact that zina and riba are forbidden, as are alcohol, pork, eating dead meat and all impure things, embezzling, bearing false witness, consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, all kinds of wrongdoing and oppression, marrying one’s mother or sister or any of those who are mentioned with them, and killing a believer unlawfully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he must know all other things that are mentioned in the Book and that the ummah is agreed upon.\" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm&nbsp; 1/57)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (30/293):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Ibn ‘Abidin said, quoting from al-‘Allami:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is obligatory for every accountable person, male or female , after learning about religion and guidance, to learn about wudu, ghusl, prayer, fasting, zakah for those who have the nisab (minimum threshold of wealth) and Hajj for those for whom it is obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Merchants must also learn the rulings on trade, so that they can avoid doubtful and makruh things in their <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/193073\" target=\"_blank\">transactions</a> ; the same applies to those who follow professions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everyone who works with something must learn the rulings concerning it so that he can avoid what is haram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said: \"As for selling, marriage and the like – which are not obligatory per se – it is haram to engage in them until one has learned their conditions.”</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If a Muslim is a merchant and riba is widespread in the land, he must learn about the prohibition on riba. This is knowledge which is an individual obligation, i.e., knowledge of how to do what is required.\" (Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din&nbsp; 1/33)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq said to Ibn al-Mubarak:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What can the believer do with knowledge except seeking it? What is he obliged to learn?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: “He cannot afford to do anything without knowledge, and he cannot avoid asking.” (Narrated by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm (1/56)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Every person in his daily life is bound to face new issues with regard to his worship and dealings with others.

      "question": "<p>My question is that, my friend did nikkah with her boyfriend for many years ago. just some friends knew about that nikkah. there parents were not invovled. Then they broke up and the boy refused to give her tallaaq/divorse. He got married and have kids now. She wants to get married but can not do that because of that nikkah. She has asked the boy many times but he has been refusing many years now, so what should she do? There is no Qazi here at our place know can declear her KHULLAH/tallaq.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What appears to be the case from your question is that the     one you are asking about got married without the permission or knowledge of     her guardian. If that is the case, then the more correct scholarly view is     that the marriage is not valid, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission     of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her     marriage is invalid.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi     (1102). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no.     2709&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of the imams are of the view that a marriage done     without a guardian is valid, and they classed as da‘eef (weak) the hadeeth     which stipulates that there should be a guardian in order for the marriage     to be valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This has been discussed in the answer to questions no.    <a href=\"/ar/answers/\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">126430</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/7989\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">7989</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the partners are separated in a marriage concerning the     validity of which the scholars differed, it has to be done through talaaq     (divorce).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the marriage concerning which there is a     difference of scholarly opinion, one of two scenarios apply:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1.The married person thinks that     it is valid. If he thinks that it is valid, then the talaaq counts as such,     and there is no confusion concerning that. For example: a man got married to     a woman who breastfed from his mother three times, and he thinks that the     breastfeeding that makes a person a mahram is five feedings. So the marriage     is valid in his opinion. In this case talaaq undoubtedly counts as such.</p>\n<p>    Similarly, if he married a woman without witnesses, and he     thinks that witnessing in marriage is not a condition of it being valid. In     this case talaaq counts as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2.The married person does not     think that the marriage is valid. In this case the scholars differed as to     whether talaaq counts as such. Some of them said that talaaq does count as     such in this case, and some of them said that it does not. Those who said     that it does not count as such said that it is because talaaq is connected     to the marriage contract. He does not think that the marriage is valid, so     he cannot issue a talaaq. This reasoning is good and there is nothing wrong     with it.</p>\n<p>    Those who say that it does not count as such say that is     because, even though he does not think the marriage is valid, others may     think that it is valid. So if he leaves her without talaaq, then a man comes     to her who thinks that the marriage was valid, he can never marry her. So     talaaq is valid with regard to a marriage concerning the validity of which     there is a difference of opinion, even if the one who issues the talaaq does     not think this is valid, because if he does not divorce her by talaaq, this     will leave this woman in limbo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If someone were to say: Why does the talaaq count as such     when he does not think that the marriage is valid and talaaq is connected to     it? We say: That is so that he will not prevent her from marrying someone     else, because someone who thinks that that marriage was valid may want to     marry her, and if this husband does not divorce her by talaaq, the other man     will never be able to marry her, because he thinks that she is still married     to him. Hence the author said: “Talaaq counts as such in the marriage     concerning the validity of which there is a difference of opinion.” And it     says in al-Rawd: “even if the one who is issuing the talaaq does not     think that.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Sharh al-Mumti‘ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,     13/25&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information please see the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/ar/answers/\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">116575</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if they did the marriage contract in the     manner mentioned in the question and they think that it was a valid     marriage, then it is essential to divorce by talaaq, so that their     separation will be confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the husband refuses to divorce his wife by talaaq or to     accept her khula‘, and she will be harmed by staying with him, then in this     case she should refer the matter to the Muslim qaadi (judge) so that he can     issue a divorce (talaaq) from him. If she is in a non-Muslim country, then     she should refer the matter to the people of knowledge in the Islamic     centres, because they take the place of the Muslim qaadi, and if they rule     that she is divorced by talaaq, then it counts as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are five pests that may be killed whether one is in Ihram or not: rats, scorpions, crows, kites [a hawk-like bird], and mad dogs.” (Reported by Muslim, 2071) Another report adds a sixth, snakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that they are harmful pests, and that they are unlike other animals which do not do harm, and so he told us to kill them whether we are in Ihram or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If other creatures, such as ants or cockroaches or dung-beetles, cause harm, they may also be killed with insecticides, but not with fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/105190\" target=\"_blank\">105190</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2896\" target=\"_blank\">2896</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/289055\" target=\"_blank\">289055</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Some people claimed to have sighted the new moon of Ramadan, whilst astronomers and those who follow calculations claim that it is not possible to have sighted it on that night. There is no confusion in my mind because of this, as calculations may be wrong. But what does confuse me is that the astronomers and those who deal with calculations claim that they tried to sight the moon that night with the telescopes and other equipment that they have but they did not see it. How can it be seen with the naked eye and not with modern equipment? If it were the other way around, and they saw it with their equipment but it was not seen with the naked eye, there would be some justification for the difference of opinion as to whether we should fast or not, and whether the people should break the fast or not. But the problem is: How can they see it with the naked eye and it is not seen with their equipment?

He told me that they estimated that the moon would appear on that night in a certain place according to the calculations they did on their computers, but he told them that it would not appear from the place that they said, because he had seen it before them the night before, and he knew the stations of the moon and from where it would rise every night. Then when the moon appeared, it rose from the place he mentioned and not the place they mentioned.

      "question": "<p>In which book of Hadees is the Explanation of Namrood's infanticide during the days of Hazarat Abrahim ?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Al-Namrood was the king of Babylon, and he     was a kaafir king. There happened between him and Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) that which Allaah describes in the verse (interpretation of the     meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Have you not looked at him who disputed     with Ibraaheem (Abraham) about his Lord (Allaah), because Allaah had given him the kingdom? When Ibraaheem (Abraham) said (to him): ‘My Lord (Allaah)     is He Who gives life and causes death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem (Abraham) said, ‘Verily, Allaah brings the sun from the     east; then bring it you from the west.’ So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allaah guides not the people, who are Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:258]</p>\n<p>There is no story about him and any child     that can be proven, as far as we know.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if you are asking about the story of the     believing boy and the kaafir king, and how the boy was killed and the people believed in Allaah, and they bore persecution for that, this is the     story of the people of the ditch, which was narrated by Muslim (3005) from the hadeeth of Suhayb (may Allaah be pleased with him), which says that     the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among those who came before you there lived a king who had a (court) sorcerer. As he (the sorcerer) grew     old, he said to the king: ‘I have grown old, so send some young boy to me so that I may teach him magic.’ He (the king) sent a boy to him so that     he might train him (in magic). On his way to the sorcerer he (the boy) met a monk and sat with him. He (the boy) listened to his (the monk's) talk     and was impressed by it. So whenever he went to the sorcerer he would pass by the monk and sit with him. And when he came to the sorcerer, he (the     sorcerer) beat him. He complained about it to the monk and he said to him: ‘When you feel afraid of the sorcerer, say: My family made me late. And     when you feel afraid of your family, say: The sorcerer made me late.’ It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way     of the people. He (the young boy) said: I shall find out today whether the sorcerer or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O     Allaah, if the affairs of the monk are dearer to You than the affairs of the sorcerer, bring death to this animal so that the people will be able     to move about freely. He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people were able to pass freely. He (the boy) then came to that monk and     told him (what had happened). The monk said: My son, today you are better than me. Your affairs have reached a stage where I think that you will     be soon put to the test, and in case you are put to the test do not reveal my identity. That young man began to heal the blind and those suffering     from leprosy and he began to cure people of (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king, who had become blind, heard about him, he came     to him with numerous gifts and said: If you heal me, all these things here will be yours. He said: I myself do not heal anyone; it is Allaah Who     heals. If you believe in Allaah, I shall also pray to Allaah to heal you. He believed in Allaah and Allaah healed him. He came to the king and sat     by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. He asked, Do you have any Lord other     than me? He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allaah; so he (the king) took hold of him and tortured him until he revealed the identity of the boy.     The boy was then summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so proficient in your magic that you     heal the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not heal anyone; it is Allah Who heals.     He (the king) took hold of him and began to torture him. So he revealed the identity of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to     him: Turn back from your religion. But he refused to do so. He (ordered) a saw to be brought and he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head     and cut it until it fell apart. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion, but he refused to     do so. So the saw was placed in the middle of his head and it was cut until it fell apart. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn     back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. He said to them: Take him to such and such a     mountain; make him climb that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down     the mountain). So they took him and made him climb the mountain and he said: O Allaah, save me from them however You will. The mountain began to     shake and they all fell down, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said:     Allaah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him away in a small boat and when you     reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they     took him and he said: O Allaah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was not long before the boat overturned and they were drowned but     he came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allaah has saved me from them. He also said     to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and     crucify me on the trunk (of a tree). Then take an arrow from my quiver and say: In the name of Allaah, the Lord of the boy; then shoot an arrow     and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people to an open plain and crucified him (the boy) on the trunk     of a tree. Then he took an arrow from his quiver, placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allaah, the Lord of the boy; he then     shot an arrow and it hit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and he died. The people said: We     believe in the Lord of this boy, we believe in the Lord of this boy, we believe in the Lord of this boy. Some people came to the king and said to     him: Do you realize that you what feared has happened? All the people now believe (in the Lord of the boy). He (the king) commanded ditches to be     dug at the entry-points of the roads. When these ditches were dug, and fires was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who does not turn     back from his (the boy's) religion will be thrown in the fire or they will be told to jump in it. So they started to do that until a woman came     with her child and she hesitated to jump into the fire. Then her child said to her: O mother, be patient, for you are following the Truth.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your saying in your question “Hazrat     Ibraaheem” is an innovated expression which is best avoided, because for the Prophets (peace be upon them) there is an expression which is used     only for them, namely “al-salaatu wa’l-salaamu ‘alayhim (blessings and peace be upon them). There is scholarly consensus on this point, as was     narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Jala’ al-Afhaam from Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on them both)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on the imam walking in the direction of the qiblah to reach the microphone so that the people can hear him",
      "question": "<p>During Taraweeh prayers, the electricity cut out. Because of that, we started to pray in the rear part of the mosque, and that was because of severe heat. During the prayer, the electricity started working again, and suddenly the imam began to walk, whilst reciting, across a large distance, approximately 25 meters, in the direction of the qiblah, in order to reach the microphone, but as members of the congregation we did not follow him in that. After the prayer, we asked him: What made you do that? And he said that he moved in order to reach the microphone, because after the electricity came back and the fans began to work again, perhaps the women on the upper level might not be able to hear his voice properly. Please advise us about the issue of his moving across this distance and how permissible it is. What are the limits on moving whilst praying? Does it make a difference whether the prayer is obligatory or voluntary? How much may a person move (during the prayer) in the case of necessity?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is permissible to move whilst praying if that is in the interests of the prayer, even if that entails a great deal of movement. al-Bukhaari (403) and Muslim (526) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar said: Whilst the people were praying Fajr in Quba’, someone came to them and said: Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) last night and he was commanded to face towards the Ka‘bah, so face towards it. They were facing towards Syria, so they turned to face the Ka‘bah&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is permissible to move (whilst praying) if that is in the interests of the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (12/354)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moving during the prayer is divided into five categories, according to the reason for it. If the reason for it is something obligatory, then moving is obligatory. If the reason for it is something prohibited, then moving is prohibited, and so on. For more information concerning that, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12683\">12683</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, with regard to the imam’s moving forward in the direction of the qiblah in order to reach the microphone so that the women could hear his recitation and takbeer, if his voice was not reaching the women or there was excessive difficulty in enabling the women to hear the recitation of the imam, then his action was correct and Islamically prescribed, because it was in the interests of the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (922) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying with the door closed, then I came and asked for it to be opened, so he walked and opened it for me, then he went back to the place where he was praying. And he mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qiblah.</p>\n<p>Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Khuzaymah (827) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying when a sheep passed in front of him and he raced with it by moving towards the qiblah (to prevent it walking in front of him), until he pressed his stomach against the wall (which was in the direction of the qiblah).</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sifat as-Salaah (p. 83)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and stood on his left, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) moved him and made him stand on his right.</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (138) and Muslim (763).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the women could hear his voice without amplification, but they would hear it more clearly and better with amplification, then what he did was not proper and in fact was extremely makrooh (disliked), because he did a lot of movement that he did not need to do, which might have resulted in distraction of the worshippers during the prayer, and caused confusion during the prayer and led to them disputing after the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the limits on moving during the prayer, the guideline is that it is permissible if it is in the interests of the prayer, even if it is a great deal of movement. But if it is not in the interests of the prayer and there is no need for that, then it is makrooh even if it is a little movement, and the prayer is rendered invalid by it if there is a great deal of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf (2/129):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Actions which are usually regarded as being a great deal and that are not part of the prayer render it invalid whether that is done deliberately or otherwise. It should be noted that the prayer is rendered invalid by a great deal of movement that is done deliberately, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion that I know of concerning that. It is also invalidated by that (great deal of movement) if it is done absentmindedly, according to the correct view, and it was narrated by the commentator and others that there was consensus on this point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by the prayer being rendered invalid by a great deal of movement is if there is no need for that. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sunnah is for the believer to focus on his prayer with proper humility, both mentally and physically, whether it is an obligatory or supererogatory prayer, because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Successful indeed are the believers</p>\n<p>Those who offer their Salat (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness”</p>\n<p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no difference in the rulings between obligatory and supererogatory prayers except in matters for which there is specific evidence. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whatever invalidates an obligatory prayer also invalidates a voluntary prayer.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni (2/47).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there may be more causes for movement during a supererogatory prayer than in an obligatory prayer, because supererogatory prayers are usually done at home, which makes it more likely that some urgent matter may arise which requires the worshipper to move, in contrast to the obligatory prayers which are usually done in the mosque,as we have seen above in the hadith about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) opening the door for ‘Aa’ishah. Ibn Hazm also narrated in al-Muhalla (2/126) from Mu‘aadhah al-‘Adawiyyah that ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers used to instruct her servant to share out the broth, and she would pass in front of her whilst she was praying, and she would gesture her to add more; and she would instruct that something be given to a poor person, gesturing to that effect whilst she was praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated from Mu‘aadhah from ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers that she stood up to pray wearing a chemise and headcover, and she pointed to the wrapper and I handed it to her; there were other women with her and she gestured to them with her hand to have some food – i.e., whilst she was praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The extent to which it is permissible to move whilst praying is known by the extent of the need to do so. If the need is something essential, such as moving in the interests of the prayer, or moving to kill a snake or a scorpion whilst praying, or moving to save someone from drowning or dying, then there is no blame on the worshipper for that, and in fact he may be instructed to do it.</p>\n<p>But if the need to move whilst praying is not essential, then the ruling on the movement is connected to that, and it varies according to the reason for it, as you will see by referring to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12683\">12683</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, what appears to us to be the case is that there is no blame on the imam for what he did in his prayer, if there was a problem in his voice reaching the women. What the people praying behind him should have done was to follow him in his prayer, especially since it was not clear to them for certain whether he was mistaken in doing that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "His parents refuse to let him shorten his lower garments. Should he obey them?",
      "question": "<p>My parents won’t let me shorten my lower garments (so that they do not come down below my ankles). Should I obey them or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah has commanded us to honour our parents in many places in His Book, such as when He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do”</p>\n<p>[al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]</p>\n<p>The greatest of rights are the rights of Allah, after which come the rights of created beings, foremost among which are the rights of parents. Hence Allah mentions His rights and parents’ rights together in many verses of the Holy Qur’aan, such as when He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.”</p>\n<p>[al-Isra’ 17:23]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obeying parents is obligatory unless they enjoin sin, in which case they should not be obeyed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4340; Muslim, 1840; Ahmad, 1098. Isbaal or letting the lower garment hang below the ankles is a major sin, so you should not obey them if they tell you to do that. But you can wear your clothes at the longest permissible length so that they do not touch the ankles, then you will not be disobeying your Lord by doing that, and you will not be going against your parents’ wishes, because it is not a condition of shortening the lower garment that it should be at mid-calf length, rather you can obey the rule of sharee’ah by not letting your clothes touch your ankles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If they insist that your clothes should be longer than ankle length, then speak to them nicely and try to convince them, but do not disobey Allah for their sake by letting your clothes hang below the ankles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal al-Shaykh was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on isbaal (letting the clothes hang below the ankles)? Is it permissible to obey my father when he wants me to let my clothes hang below the ankles?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Isbaal is haraam, indeed it is one of the major sins. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever allows his garment to trail along the ground out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” And he mentioned the three whom Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment, among whom is the one who allows his garment to hang below his ankles. The one who does this is disobeying Allah and transgressing His sacred limits, so he has to repent to Allah. He will be punished because Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be punished because he is given a warning of Hell fire, which indicates that isbaal is one of the major sins, Moreover there is nothing good in isbaal, because it damages the clothes and may make the person stumble, as ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the young man whom he saw allowing his garment to hang below his ankles – who came to visit ‘Umar in his final sickness – “O young man, lift up your lower garment for it will make your garment last longer and is more obedient to your Lord.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to obeying your parents, parents are not to be obeyed if that involves disobeying Allah. If they tell you to let your garment hang below your ankles, then you should disobey them, because isbaal is a major sin and there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawah Majallat al-Da’wah, issue no. 1741&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Why_do_we_need_religion\">Why do we need religion?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#How_to_attain_full_knowledge\">How to attain full knowledge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Religion_is_a_protective_shield_for_society\">Religion is a protective shield for society</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Belief_and_faith_regulate_man\">Belief and faith regulate man</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"Why_do_we_need_religion\">Why do we need religion?</span></h3>\n<p>Man’s need for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21525\" target=\"_blank\">religion</a> is greater than his need for any of the other necessities of life, because man needs to know what pleases Allah and what angers Him; he needs to act in his own interests and to ward off things that will harm him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/210742\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> is what distinguishes between actions that will bring benefit and actions that will cause harm. This is Allah’s justice towards His creation, and His light which shines for His slaves. People cannot live without laws (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/282538\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> ) to help them distinguish between what they should and should not do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because man has a will, he has to know what he wants, is it beneficial or harmful? Is it good for him or bad for him? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of these things may be known instinctively, some of it may be known by working it out in a rational manner, and some of it may only be known from the teachings and guidance of the messengers. (See al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 213, 214; Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah, vol. 2, p. 383)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No matter how impressive and attractive the atheist, materialist schools of thought may be, and no matter how many ideas and theories there may be, individuals and societies can never do without the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/232218\" target=\"_blank\">true religion</a> , they can never answer the needs of body and soul. The further the individual sinks into those ways, the more certain it becomes that he cannot find security or quench his thirst, and that there is no way out except through the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9607\" target=\"_blank\">true religion</a> .</p>\n<p>Ernest Renan says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is possible that everything we love could disappear and that rational thinking, science and industry could cease to exist, but it is impossible that religion could be eliminated. Rather it will remain as proof that materialistic thought which wants to restrict man to the narrow path of the base life of this world is false.” (See al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, p. 87)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muhammad Farid Wajdi says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is impossible that the idea of religion could diminish, because it is the most refined inclination of the soul and its noblest emotion, in addition to being the inclination that ennobles man. Rather this inclination will increase and the religious nature of man will remain so long as he retains that reason which enables him to distinguish between beauty and ugliness. This instinct will increase according to his level of rationality.” (Al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, p. 87) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If man is far away from his Lord, then according to his level of knowledge and understanding he will realize the extent of his ignorance of his Lord and His attributes, and his ignorance of his own self and what is good for him or bad for him, what leads to bliss and what leads to doom, and his ignorance of such basic matters as astronomy, mathematics and the like.&nbsp; At this point the wise man will move from the state of arrogance and pride to humility and submission, and will realize that behind all this knowledge is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, and that behind nature there is an Almighty Creator. This truth compels the objective seeker to believe in the unseen and acknowledge the true religion, and to respond to the call of human nature and innate instinct. If a person fails to do that he is going against his innate nature and sinking to the level of the dumb animals. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus we may conclude that following the true religion – that which is based on belief in Allah Alone (Tawhid) and worshipping Him in the way that He has prescribed – is an essential element of life if man is to be a true slave to the Lord of the Worlds, and to attain happiness and be free of tiredness and exhaustion in this world and in the Hereafter. It is essential in order to perfect man’s rational thinking. In this way alone can reason fulfil its desires; without it man cannot fulfil his higher ambitions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an essential element for purifying the soul and disciplining the emotions, for in religion the noble emotions find fertile ground and an inexhaustible spring to help them achieve their goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an essential element for strengthening willpower and supplying it with the greatest motives and power to resist the factor of helplessness and despair.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_to_attain_full_knowledge\">How to attain full knowledge</span></h3>\n<p>On this basis, if there is anyone who says that man is sociable in nature, we must say that man is religious by nature. (See al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, 84, 98), because man has two strengths, knowledge and willpower, and his ultimate happiness depends on him acquiring both. Full knowledge can only be attained by knowing the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing Allah, the Creator and Provider Who created man from nothing and bestowed blessings upon him.</li>\n<li>Knowing the names and attributes of Allah, and the effect of these names upon His slaves.</li>\n<li>Knowing the way to reach Him.</li>\n<li>Knowing the obstacles that prevent man from knowing this way and the great blessings to which it leads.</li>\n<li>Knowing yourself in a true sense, and knowing what your soul needs, what is good for it and what is bad for it, and knowing its faults and shortcomings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These five matters will complete a person’s knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Achieving perfect will power can only be achieved by paying attention to the rights of Allah over His slaves and fulfilling them sincerely, adhering to that and bearing witness to the blessings of Allah. These two strengths can only be perfected with the help of Allah, so man needs Allah to guide him to the Straight Path to which He guides His close friends. (See al-Fawaid, p, 18-19)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion_is_a_protective_shield_for_society\">Religion is a protective shield for society</span></h3>\n<p>Once we know that the true religion is the divine support that directs the potentials of man, then we know that religion is also a protective shield for society, because human life can only be strong when there is cooperation among the members of society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This cooperation can only be achieved by means of a system that regulates the relationships between them, defines their duties and protects their rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This system needs a deterrent that will deter one from transgressing and encourage one to follow the system, one that carries weight in people’s hearts and prevents them from overstepping its limits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is this authority? I say that there is no power on earth that can match the power of religion in protecting the sanctity of the system, guaranteeing the coherence of society and the stability of its system, and providing the means of peace and security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reason for that is that man differs from all other living beings in that his voluntary actions and dealings are governed by something that can be neither seen nor heard, namely the religious belief that disciplines the heart and guides his faculties. Man is inevitably led by his belief, whether it is sound or corrupt. If his belief is sound, everything else will also be sound, but if it is corrupt then everything else will also be corrupt.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Belief_and_faith_regulate_man\">Belief and faith regulate man</span></h3>\n<p>Belief and faith are the two things that regulate man and – as we can see in most cases – they are of two types:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Belief in the importance of virtue and human dignity, and other abstract values which make noble souls feel ashamed to go against their principles even if they are spared the consequences of physical punishment.</li>\n<li>Belief in Allah and that He is always watching and knows what is in our hearts, and that He knows secrets and that which is more hidden. The authority of SharI`ah is based on its commands and prohibitions, and makes a person feel shy before Allah, either out of love for Him, or out of fear of Him, or both. Undoubtedly this type of faith is the stronger of the two and carries more weight in human hearts. It is more able to resist the storms of desire and the upheavals of emotion, and it has more effect on the hearts of the masses and the elite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this reason, religion is the best guarantee for ensuring that people will deal with one another on a basis of fairness and justice, and hence it is a social necessity. It comes as no surprise that the relationship of religion to the ummah is like that of the heart to the body. Nowadays we see that there are many religions in the world, and each people has its religion which they cling to. What is the true religion which will fulfil the aspirations of the human soul? What are the guidelines of the true religion?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on getting a “covered” credit card that stipulates in order to obtain it that one should have a bank account and one cannot withdraw money using the credit card unless there is already credit in the credit card account. Please note that the validity of this card is two years only, and they charge an annual fee of 70 Libyan dinars.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with using a “covered” or prepaid credit card, and there is nothing wrong with the company that issues it charging a fee for it that is higher than the actual cost, because this is a fee in return for offering this service. Rather, what is not allowed is charging more than the actual costs incurred in the case of an “non-covered” credit card, whether the additional amount is added to the fee for issuing it or to the transaction fee, because when the bank gives money to a customer when the credit card is not covered, this is actually a loan to him, and it is not permissible for the bank to charge interest or make a profit on this loan; it should be limited only to charging the actual costs involved in issuing it.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that it is not permissible to deposit money in riba-based banks, even if it is a deposit into a current account, because the bank uses the money to help it to carry out its transactions, both those that are permissible and those that are haraam. This is the rule except in cases of necessity, where one has to do deposit money in the bank so as to protect it and other cases of need, when there is no Islamic bank. We have previously quoted the words of the scholars concerning that.</p>\n<p>Based on that, if there is no Islamic bank that offers credit cards and you need to use one, then it is permissible to open an account in the riba-based bank, but it should be limited to depositing enough to cover the credit card.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Why did the Sahaabah use burning with fire as a punishment for some crimes?",
      "question": "<p>Didn’t the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one punishes with fire except Allah”? Therefore isn’t burning haraam according to Islamic teachings? But in fatwa no. 38622 you stated that ‘Ali, Abu Bakr and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed burned those who committed the sin of homosexuality; were they not sinning by doing that? Even if we assume that someone is killed in a retaliatory punishment (qisaas), isn’t qisaas by burning haraam?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is proven in the texts that punishment by burning with fire is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burned some people. News of that reached Ibn ‘Abbaas and he said: If it were me, I would not have burned them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not punish with the punishment of Allah.” And I would have executed them as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, then execute him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3017).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent us on a mission and said: “If you find So and so, and So and so, then burn them with fire.” Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when we were about to leave: “I had commanded you to burn So and so, and So and so. But verily no one punishes with fire except Allah. So if you find them, execute them.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3016)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the hadith concerning this topic, what appears to be the case is that the prohibition in it indicates that this act is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fath al-Baari (6/150).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This prohibition on punishing anyone by burning with fire is general in application, but the majority of scholars made an exception in the case of burning with fire by way of retaliatory punishment (qisaas) and making the punishment fit the crime. If someone burns another person then it is permissible, according to this view, to punish him by burning him, by way of retaliatory punishment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They quoted as evidence for that the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is with Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:194]</p>\n<p>“And if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of Allah), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.)”</p>\n<p>[an-Nahl 16:126].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle says that acting upon two sound texts that have not been abrogated is better than overlooking one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147416\">147416</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Therefore the majority of fuqaha’ think that it is permissible to burn with fire by way of retaliatory punishment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One group of scholars said: Whoever burns is to be burnt. This is also the view of Maalik, the scholars of Madinah, ash-Shaafa‘i and his companions, Ahmad and Ishaaq.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from at-Tawdeeh li Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Saheeh (18/61)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what is mentioned in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38622\">38622</a> about ‘Ali, Abu Bakr and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed burning those who committed the crime of homosexuality, it may be said in response to that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), especially the most prominent figures among them, such as the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs and others, have been commended by Allah in the Qu’ran and their virtues have been proven in the Sunnah. All of that is because of their assiduous compliance and obedience to the commands of Islam, their steadfastness in adhering to them, and their efforts to call people to the faith, until they met Allah, may He be exalted, when they were like that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the case of those who are of such high standing, if we come across a verdict or fatwa of theirs that appears to contradict an Islamic text, then in this case we must follow the steps outlined below:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firstly: we should establish the soundness or otherwise of what is attributed to them. It is not permissible to attribute anything to a person unless we are certain that it is soundly proven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The incidents of killing with fire that are attributed to the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) are not all soundly narrated. With regard to what is mentioned in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38622\">38622</a>, to which you referred, this fatwa was to explain the views of the scholars concerning the punishment of one who commits the immoral act of homosexuality, in which we quoted all the views concerning the method of punishment for this immoral act.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Burning was mentioned, quoting those who said that it was proven in reports from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), such as Ibn al-Qayyim, who stated definitively that this incident was proven, as was quoted from him in the fatwa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there are those who disagreed with Ibn al-Qayyim and regarded the report of this story as da‘eef (weak), such as al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him), who said in as-Sunan al-Kubra (17/219): This is mursal. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that mursal is one of the types of da‘eef hadiths.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to burning, Ibn Abi’d-Dunya narrated via al-Bayhaqi and via Ibn al-Munkadir that Khaalid ibn al-Waleed wrote to Abu Bakr, telling him that he had found a man among one of the Arab tribes with whom men would have intercourse as with a woman. Abu Bakr called the Sahaabah together and asked them about that, and the one who had the strictest view was ‘Ali, who said: We think that we should burn him with fire, and the Sahaabah agreed on that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I say: This is da‘eef jiddan (very weak). If it were saheeh, it would constitute definitive proof.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from ad-Diraayah fi Takhreej Ahaadeeth al-Hidaayah (2/103)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd commented on this report as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The verdict of the leading scholars is that it is a mursal hadith, as was stated clearly by al-Bayhaqi and ash-Shawkaani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Hudood wa’t-Ta‘zeeraat ‘inda Ibn al-Qayyim (p. 175)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, this incident is not soundly or definitively proven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: in cases where a fatwa or verdict is soundly attributed, as in the story of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burned some people. News of that reached Ibn ‘Abbaas and he said: If it were me, I would not have burned them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not punish with the punishment of Allah.” And I would have executed them as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, then execute him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3017).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an incident such as this, there must have been a reason that made ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) issue the verdict of burning. There may have been the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Perhaps the hadith prohibiting burning did not reach him. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were just like any other people: one of them may have missed out on some knowledge, according to his situation, as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar missed out on some issues of knowledge that others had learned, even though they were superior to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all), and others also missed out on some issues of knowledge and hadiths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is well known.</p>\n<p>Al-Haazimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah that ‘Ali burned some people who had apostatised from Islam. News of that reached Ibn ‘Abbaas and he said: I would not have burned them with fire, for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not punish with the punishment of Allah.” And I would have executed them as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, then execute him.”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: News of that reached ‘Ali and he said: Woe to Ibn ‘Abbaas!</p>\n<p>This hadith is proven and saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They said: The fact that ‘Ali was surprised by the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas indicates that news of this abrogation had not reached him; when it did reach him, he adopted that view. Were it not for that, he would have objected to what Ibn ‘Abbaas said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-I‘tibaar fi’n-Naaskih wa’l-Mansookh min al-Athaar (p. 194)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Perhaps he had forgotten the hadith that prohibited it, and did not remember it, and the one who forgets is excused and is not sinning.</p>\n<p>There are similar cases in the biographies of the Sahaabah in which one of them forgot a hadith and others reminded him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Adam al-Ethiopi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be that he said it – i.e., when ‘Ali said “Woe to Ibn ‘Abbaas!” – by way of approving of what he said, and that Ibn ‘Abbaas remembered what ‘Ali had forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Dhakheerat al-‘Uqba fi Sharh al-Mujtaba (31/385).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Perhaps he understood the prohibition as meaning that it was merely disliked, not prohibited, as was the view favoured by some of the scholars.</p>\n<p>Az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Woe to Ibn ‘Abbaas!” It may be that he did not agree with his objection, and thought that the prohibition meant that it was makrooh (disliked), because ‘Ali thought that burning was permissible, as did Khaalid ibn al-Waleed and others, adopting a stern stance towards the disbelievers, and by way of inflicting a severe punishment on them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh al-Muwatta’ (3/193-194)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is on the basis of reasons such as these that we may interpret the report that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) burned those who committed the immoral act of homosexuality, if the report is proven to be sound.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It should be noted that not one of the leading scholars – who are widely accepted among the ummah – deliberately went against the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his Sunnah in any matter, minor or major.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are unanimously and definitely agreed that it is obligatory to follow the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that the opinion of anyone may be accepted or rejected, except the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if one of them holds a view, and there is a saheeh hadith to the contrary, then he must have an excuse for not following the hadith. All excuses fall into three categories:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. That he did not believe that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that.</p>\n<p>2. That he did not believe that he was referring to that issue when he said it.</p>\n<p>3. That he believed that that ruling had been abrogated.</p>\n<p>These three categories are main categories and there may be sub-categories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Raf‘ al-Malaam ‘an al-A’immah al-A‘laam (p. 8-9)</p>\n<p>To sum up: what may be stated definitively is that the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not deliberately go against the prohibition on punishment by burning. What has been narrated from some of them (concerning that) is either not saheeh (sound), or it is saheeh but they are excused for what they did on the basis of ijtihaad, because they were qualified to engage therein.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the mujtahid strives his utmost to issue a correct verdict and fatwa but makes a mistake, he is rewarded and is not regarded as having sinned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If a judge passes a judgement having striven to reach a decision, and he gets it right, he will have two rewards. If he passes a judgement having striven to reach a decision and he gets it wrong, he will have one reward.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7352) and Muslim (1716).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (4/491-492)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Our attitude towards rumours and news on the Internet",
      "question": "<p>How should we deal with the rumours that appear on the Internet? What is the Muslim’s attitude towards the news that we read here and there, and what is written in chat rooms, especially since some of it is good news for the Muslims, but the source is unknown.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We live nowadays at a time when many rumours that bring hope are appearing in the guise of news. These appears on Internet web sites and chat rooms, so that they may be spread to the people as glad tidings and so that good-hearted people may accept them as indisputable facts coming from trustworthy sources. Even if any of them could be proven, there are still many rumours that can be classed as no more than fabrications. The one who thinks about this will understand that many of the global media, including the Arab media, exaggerate in their coverage of some events and they analyze them in a subjective manner that shows a complete bias and evident absence of objectivity, trying to take revenge by adding to the news and exaggerating, and telling weird news stories. So there is no such thing as credibility in these media, especially when emotions and wishes play a part. This is apart from the fact that media objectivity has become a victim of this current war, and western circles have rejected the lessons [of objectivity, etc.] that they used to teach others. But this does not mean that we should dispute the facts or deny what is taking place in reality, or that we should face this bias with exaggeration and hopes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here we should pause and remind ourselves, and the good-hearted people who hear this news and tell it to others with good intentions – and those who fabricate these rumours and take upon themselves the job of propagating them – of a few facts. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – We must be certain about the news we accept, and we should not accept it simply because it happens to coincide with our hopes and wishes. We have our own methodology of verifying matters, and we should be consistent with regard to what we like and dislike. It is not right for us to doubt news accompanied by pictures from the battlefield, or to shed doubts on it, when the bottom line is one’s senses. At a time when you see news going around through mobiles from some internet web sites, there are some people who may accept such news but it should be noted that there are people who will never believe it. So they should beware of exposing themselves to being called liars. An old proverb says, “Whoever pursues weird news will be disbelieved.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – We have to be cautious about the fact that the source is anonymous. There is no information more important than that of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), yet despite that it is not part of the Muslims’ methodology to accept reports of the Sunnah from people who are unknown. Hence news must be taken from authentic sources; if it is not authentic then it should at least be known, so that people may be able to find out for themselves whether it is authentic or not. What a bad habit it is for a man to say, “I heard” or “they said.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – If there are people who permit the fabrication of rumours, basing that on some kind of ijtihaad, we must refuse to be the means of transmitting that by believing it and propagating it. (Whoever narrates a saying knowing it to be a lie is one of the liars).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – One of the reasons used by the fabricators to justify making up these rumours is that it is a kind of lying in war, which is permissible. They ignore the fact – of which they are not ignorant – that the only kind of lying that is permitted in war is that which misleads the enemy, not that which creates illusions and deceives the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 – If we have lost some aspects of the battle, we must not lose truthfulness which is our capital in our dealings with others. People will be astounded and amazed if they find out that this false news was transmitted through a good man. Whoever is known to have lied or to have transmitted lies will no longer be in a position to be considered trustworthy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;6 – Similarly the righteous will be astounded and will become suspicious of a narrator who appeared to be righteous because he was telling this news and confirming it to them. At the same time, others will express joy, those who took the opposite stance to these youngsters and said, “This is their news, this is their credibility!” Everyone who was upset by the Muslim revival will find an opportunity to generalize this mistake and accuse all the pioneers of the revival of behaving like that. Please, for Allah’s sake, do not make the enemy rejoice or give them a reason to attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 – If truthfulness is an Islamic virtue and part of Arabic chivalry, then telling lies is an obscenity that Islam has forbidden. Even the mushrik Arabs refrained from telling lies, as Abu Sufyaan – when he was still a mushrik – said: “Were it not that I am afraid that people may find out that I had told a lie, I would have told lies about him.” That was when he was speaking to Heraclius (about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). He did not want to have even one lie to be found in his history, even if it was a lie told against his enemy Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Heraclius (the Roman ruler). We are concerned that the propagation of these rumours may lead people to record a lot of lies against us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8 – Fabricating rumours and believing them readily is a form of escapism in the face of a reality which one dislikes and with which one does not feel comfortable. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The soul finds consolation in denying that which it does not like and in fabricating and disseminating rumours, but in the end it will have to submit to the authority of overwhelming reality. But this psychological trick is not fit to be the means of escapism for the followers of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who taught them the virtues of truthfulness and commanded them to strive their utmost to be truthful. He said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will continue to speak the truth and strive to be truthful, until he will be recorded with Allah as a speaker of the truth. And lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell, a man will continue to tell lies and strive in telling lies, until he will be recorded with Allah as a liar.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9 – Delaying recognition of realities and veiling reality with illusions, the greatest form of which is believing and disseminating rumours, will only multiply the amount of losses, and the greatest loss will be the loss of values. The highest and most precious of those values is truthfulness. “then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them” [Muhammad 47:21 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;10 – Recognizing the truth is the first step towards dealing with crises and overcoming them, but not admitting them and concealing them are among the greatest means of reinforcing them, renewing them and repeating them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;11 – Our advice is not to transmit this news. We must advise those who transmit it with the best of intentions and present them with the real facts, we should not try to spare their feelings at the expense of our reason and the transmission of truthful news, and we should try to rescue them from the anxiety of illusion and point them in the direction of reality, because truthfulness brings peace of mind and lies bring suspicion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;12 – Sayyid Qutub (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reality of a thing defeats the outward appearance of another thing, even if it is the reality of kufr.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How I wish that I did not have to talk in this manner, but the problem is there and must be addressed. I have tried to be truthful when speaking about truthfulness, for the dearest of speech to Allah is that which is most sincere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)”</p>\n<p>[al-Tawbah 9:119 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>O Allah, show us the truth as truth and enable us to follow it; show us the false as false and enable us to avoid it. Guide us concerning disputed matters of truth by Your leave, for You guide Whomsoever You wish to the Straight Path.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammd and upon his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "He owes many expiations for breaking oaths (kafaarat yameen) but he does not know what some of them are",
      "question": "<p>I owe many expiations for breaking oaths, some of which I know and some I do not know, because I often swear to do something then break that oath. This has become a habit with me. How can I expiate for that even though there are many of them?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What is required of the       Muslim is to take the matter of oaths seriously, by not swearing many of       them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And make not Allaah’s     (Name) an excuse in your oaths”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:224]</p>\n<p>So do not swear oaths     except when necessary. The Muslim must protect his oath by offering     expiation if he wants to do something other than what he swore to do,     because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “By Allaah, if Allaah wills, I do not swear an oath and then see something     that is better than it but I offer expiation for my oath and do that which     is better, or I do that which is better and offer expiation for my oath.”     Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their Saheehs. This version was     narrated by al-Bukhaari. It was also narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Nasaa’i,     al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and Imam Ahmad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to numerous     oaths, if they all had to do with the same thing, then expiation only needs     to be offered once. For example, if you said, “By Allaah, I will not speak     to So and so,” and you said that many times, then you spoke to him, then you     only have to offer expiation once.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if you swore oaths     regarding several things, such as if you said, “By Allaah, I will not speak     to So and so,” then you spoke to him, and you said, “By Allaah, I will not     travel to such and such a place,” then you went there, and so on, then for     each oath you have to offer expiation. And you should try to be on the safe     side by offering expiation for whatever you think is most likely to be the     case, so that will have discharged your duty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah is the Source     of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad     and his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "Definition of terrorism and what it means in Islam and in the West",
      "question": "<p>We have heard a great deal about terrorism. What is terrorism according to the Muslim view? What is terrorism according to the Western view? How can we debate with them if we differ with them concerning the definition?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Terrorism (Arabic irhaab) is a term that refers to scaring others. In and of itself it is neither good nor bad, unless the one who uses this word intends it to mean something and unless we see the consequences of the actions based on it. Whoever says that terrorism (irhaab) in Islam is synonymous with killing is mistaken, because the linguistic meaning of the word does not reflect that. Terrorism refers to scaring, not killing per se. In terms of Arabic usage, words derived from the same root as irhaab (terrorism) appear in the Qur’an where our Lord, may He be exalted, instructs us to fear Him, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “and fear [only] Me [wa iyyaaya farhaboon]” [al-Baqarah 2:40]. He has also commanded us to prepare to face the enemy from whom we expect plots against us and plans to wage war against us. This preparation is intended to scare (or terrify) the enemy so that we will not become easy prey for him. This is stated clearly in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:60].</p>\n<p>The unjust colonialist states use this word in conjunction with Islam, intending thereby to distort its image in the sight of all people. Hence they set up conferences and held seminars, and established research institutes in the name of fighting terrorism, but in all of these efforts there was no discussion at all about these criminal colonialist states who are oppressing the weak Muslims, such as the Hindus and their terrorising of Muslims in Kashmir, or the Russians and their terrorising of Muslims in Chechnya, or the Americans and their terrorising of Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Zionists and their terrorising of Muslims in Palestine. Some naïve Muslims have started to use this word to describe anyone they want to fight, and put people off him. They may be right in describing a particular group of Muslims as terrorists, but what about the states that use terrorism, and what about criminal racist organisations that have been spared from having this word used against them, which has become used exclusively in reference to Muslims?!</p>\n<p>The rulings and teachings of Islam were prescribed by Allah for the purpose of protecting the honour, life and wealth of the Muslim. For that purpose Islam forbids killing, theft, zina (unlawful sex), and slander, and has ordained severe punishments for anyone who commits those crimes. The punishment may go as far as execution – as in the case of the previously-married zaani (adulterer) – so as to protect people’s honour.</p>\n<p>There is a severe punishment for one who terrorises and frightens people, such as gangs of bandits on the highways and those who do similar deeds within the city. They are the ones who strive to spread mischief and corruption on earth. Allah has prescribed the severest punishments for them, so as to ward off their evil and protect people’s wealth, lives and honour. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:33].</p>\n<p>In fact, Islam went even further, as it forbids the Muslim to scare his brother, even in jest. It was narrated from as-Saa’ib ibn Yazeed that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one of you should take his brother’s property in jest or in earnest, and whoever has taken his brother’s staff, let him return it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2160) and Abu Dawood (5003); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla said: The companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that they were travelling with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. One of the men fell asleep, and some of them went and took some arrows that he had with him, and when the man woke up he panicked, and the people laughed. He said: What made you laugh? They said: Nothing, but we took this man’s arrows and he panicked. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to scare or alarm another Muslim.” Narrated by Ahmad (23064) and Abu Daawood (4351). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>“Terrorism” (irhaab) in Islam is of two types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is praiseworthy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This refers to scaring an enemy lest he attack the Muslims and occupy their land. That involves being fully prepared, arming themselves with faith, being united, and equipping themselves with weapons. The verse from Soorat al-Anfaal quoted above explains that it is obligatory for the Muslims to do this.</p>\n<p>Islam is not alone in this regard. Rather all nations compete in manufacturing arms and equipping themselves with weapons of mass destruction, establishing huge armies, and holding military parades to show off their troops and weapons. All of that is a show of strength intended to scare their neighbours and enemies, lest they think of attacking them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is blameworthy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This refers to scaring those who do not deserve to be scared, Muslims or others whose lives are protected by Islamic law, such as those who have a covenant with the Muslims, those to whom the Muslims have granted protection and safety, and non-Muslims living under Muslim rule (ahl adh-dhimmah)</p>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council has defined terrorism as: acts of aggression and enmity carried out by individuals, groups or states by way of transgressing against people (affecting their religious commitment, physical and mental well-being, wealth or honour). That includes all ways of scaring, harming and threatening people, or killing them unlawfully, and all actions that are connected to those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, scaring wayfarers and travellers, acts of banditry, and all violent acts or threats that take place in support of criminal objectives, whether they are done by individuals or groups, with the aim of instilling fear and terror in people, scaring them by harming them, or exposing their lives, freedom, sense of security and well-being to danger. Another type of terrorism is damaging the environment, facilities, public or private property, or exposing some national or natural resources to danger. All of these are ways of spreading mischief and corruption on earth, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden the Muslims to do in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters”</p>\n<p>[al-Qasas 28:77].</p>\n<p>Sixteenth session, Makkah al-Mukarramah, 21-26/10/1422 AH -- 5-10/1/2002 CE</p>\n<p>In this statement, they pointed out two important issues:</p>\n<p>The first issue is refuting the argument of those who describe Islam as being a religion of terrorism. Among other things, this statement said:</p>\n<p>The members of the Council have noted that media campaigns are well orchestrated, and based on lies and nonsense, as they are organised by the types of media that are irrational and hostile, which are directed by the Zionist media organisations to stir up resentment, hatred and discrimination against Islam and Muslims, and to make false accusations against the final religion of Allah, foremost among which is the accusation of terrorism.</p>\n<p>It became clear to the members of the Council that accusing Islam of terrorism through media campaigns is but an attempt to put people off Islam, as people are showing interest in it and are entering the religion of Allah in crowds.</p>\n<p>The members of the Council call upon the Muslim World League and other Muslim organisations, and indeed all Muslims, to defend Islam, whilst paying attention to choosing the best methods that are appropriate to the honour that may be attained by undertaking this mission in the context of refuting the lies against Islam, and the accusation of terrorism. It may be noted that terrorism is a global phenomenon that cannot be attributed to a particular religion or people. Rather it is a phenomenon that stems from extremism of which no modern society is free. They explained that there are different types of extremism, such as political extremism, ideological extremism or religious extremism. Extremism that results from exaggeration about some issues of religion is not limited to the followers of a particular religion. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, mentioned the People of the Book exaggerating about their religion, and He forbade them to do that, as He says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Say, O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.\"”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:77].</p>\n<p>The second issue that the council discussed is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. This is a matter concerning which the global media is silent, and has not exposed the people behind it. Among other things, the council said in a statement:</p>\n<p>The Council affirms that there is another type of terrorism, which is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. One of its clearest and most abhorrent forms is the terrorism that is perpetrated by the Zionists in Palestine, and what the Serbs did in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosova. The Council regards this type of terrorism as posing the gravest danger to security and peace in the world, and regards confronting it as coming under the heading of self-defence and jihad in Allah’s cause.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>With regard to terrorism perpetrated by the West, it is what we read of and witness of their invasion of weaker states and the plundering of their resources, and what we see of torture, rape and killing, all of which is documented via audio and video media, in documents that cannot be denied. This is a continuation of their historical practice of occupation by means of force, violence and weapons.</p>\n<p>What is really strange is that Western states – especially America –have not given a definition of terrorism until now! It is clear that they would implicate themselves by any definition they chose. Therefore they have given this word a vague meaning, to be applied to whoever they decide to accuse of terrorism.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>From ancient times, the disbelievers have waged war against Islam, describing it in the worst of terms, in order to put people off it. “They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.” [at-Tawbah 9:32]. That includes their description of Islam as terrorism and savagery. They forget that terrorism, savagery, genocide, transgression against people unlawfully, and all other blameworthy attitudes in fact belong to the way of the disbelievers and are part of the disbelievers’ character.</p>\n<p>The fact that some so-called Muslims have behaved wrongly – either out of ignorance or bad intentions – cannot be attributed to Islam, for Islam forbids such deeds.</p>\n<p>The way to protect Islam from this accusation is to explain that the actions of these individuals has nothing to do with Islam; rather these are cases of individuals acting badly, and every Muslim is prone to error; no one is infallible except the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Fawzaan (1/416, question no. 247)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Can I do one wudu after another, seeking greater reward, because I heard that doing that is disliked (makrooh)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is Sunnah to renew wudu even when one still has wudu, according to the majority of scholars, including the four imams. This is indicated by a number of hadiths, including the following:</p>\n<p>The report narrated by al-Bukhari (214) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do wudu for every prayer. At-Tirmidhi (58) added: whether he was in a state of purity or not.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our companions are agreed that it is recommended to renew wudu, which means when a person’s wudu is still valid and he does wudu again without having invalidated his wudu. End quote.</p>\n<p>See: <em>al-Majmoo‘</em> (1/495), <em>al-Mughni</em> (1/96) and <em>al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em> (10/155).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>When is it recommended to renew wudu? There are several scholarly views. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The most correct view in our madhhab is: If he prayed with the first wudu, whether the prayer was obligatory or supererogatory. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘</em>: Renewing wudu may be Sunnah, if the person prayed with the wudu he did previously. If he prayed with the wudu he did previously, then it is recommended for him to do wudu again for the next prayer.</p>\n<p>For example, someone did wudu for Zuhr and prayed Zuhr, then the time for ‘Asr came and he was still in a state of purity. In that case, it is Sunnah for him to do a new wudu, because he already prayed with the previous wudu. So renewing wudu for ‘Asr is something prescribed. If he did not pray with it, meaning that he did wudu for ‘Asr before the time for the prayer began, and did not pray with this wudu, then when the adhaan was given for ‘Asr he renewed this wudu, this is not prescribed, because he did not pray with the first wudu… End quote.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Their efforts in calling people to Allah (da’wah) cannot be denied. But like many other groups they make some mistakes, and some points should be noted concerning them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistakes_of_Jama39at_al-Tablighnbsp\">Mistakes of Jama'at al-Tabligh&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>These points may be summed up as follows, noting that these mistakes may vary within this group, depending on the environment and society in which they find themselves. In societies in which knowledge and scholars are prevalent and the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah is widespread, the mistakes are much less; in other societies these mistakes may be greater. Some of their mistakes are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Not adopting the ‘aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah. This is clearly seen from the variations in the ‘aqidah of some of their members and even of some of their leaders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Their not paying attention to shar’i knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Their misinterpretation of some Quranic verses in a manner that was not intended by Allah. For example they interpret the verses on jihad as referring to “going out for da’wah”. The verses which mentioned the word khuruj (going out) etc. are interpreted by them as meaning going out for da’wah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – They make their system of going out for da’wah an act of worship. So they started to misquote the Quran to support their system which specifies certain numbers of days and months. This system, which they think is based on evidence from Quran, is widespread among them in all countries and environments. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 – They do some things that go against shari’ah, such as appointing one of them to make du'a for them whilst the group goes out for da’wah, and they think that their success or failure depends on whether or not this man was sincere and his du'a accepted. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>6 – Da’if (weak) and mawdu’ (fabricated) ahadeeth are widespread among them, and this is not befitting for those who aim to call people to Allah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 – They do not speak of munkarat (evil things), thinking that enjoining what is good is sufficient. Hence we find that they do not speak about evils that are widespread among the people, even though the slogan of this ummah – which they continually repeat – is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful” </strong>[Aal ‘Imran 3:104 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>The successful are those who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, not just those who do only one of the two.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8 – Some of them fall into self-admiration and arrogance, which leads them to look down on others, and even to look down on the scholars and describe them as inactive and sleeping, or to show off. So you find them talking about how they went out and travelled, and they saw such and such, which leads to unfavourable results, as we have mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9 – They regard going out for da’wah as better than many acts of worship such as jihad and seeking knowledge, even though those things are obligatory duties, or may be obligatory for some people but not others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10 – Some of them audaciously issue fatwas, and discuss tafsir and hadith. That is because they allow each one of them to address the people and explain to them. This leads to them speaking audaciously on matters of shari’ah. So they inevitably speak of the meaning of a ruling, hadith or verse when they have not read anything about it, or listened to any of the scholars. And some of them are new Muslims or have only recently come back to Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>11- Some of them are negligent with regard to the rights of their children and wives. We have discussed the seriousness of this matter in the answer to question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3043\" target=\"_blank\">3043</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence the scholars do not allow people to go out with them, except for those who want to help them and correct the mistakes that they have fallen into.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We should not keep the people away from them altogether, rather we must try to correct their mistakes and advise them so that their efforts will continue and they will be correct according to the Quran and Sunnah. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fatwas_on_Jama39at_al-Tabligh\">Fatwas on Jama'at al-Tabligh</span></h3>\n<p>There follow the fatwas of some of the scholars concerning <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/47431\" target=\"_blank\">Jama'at al-Tabligh</a> :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39349\" target=\"_blank\">Jama'at al-Tabligh</a> do not have proper understanding of the issues of ‘aqidah, so it is not permissible to go out with them, except for one who has knowledge and understanding of the correct ‘aqidah of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10777\" target=\"_blank\">Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah</a> , so that he can guide them and advise them, and cooperate with them in doing good, because they are very active, but they need more knowledge and someone who can guide them of those who have knowledge of Tawheed and the Sunnah. May Allah bless us all with proper understanding of Islam and make us steadfast in adhering to it.” *Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 8/331)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Going out for the sake of Allah does not refer to the kind of going out that they mean nowadays. Going out for the sake of Allah means going out to fight. What they call going out nowadays is a bid’ah (innovation) that was not narrated from the salaf.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Going out to call people to Allah cannot be limited to a certain number of days, rather one should call people to Allah according to one's abilities, without limiting that to a group or to forty days or more or less than that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly the da’iyah must have knowledge. It is not permissible for a person to call people to Allah when he is ignorant. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge” </strong>[Yusuf 12:108], i.e., with knowledge, because the caller must know that to which he calls people, what is obligatory, mustahabb, haram and makruh. He has to know what shirk, sin, kufr, immorality and disobedience are; he has to know the degrees of denouncing evil and how to do it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The kind of going out that distracts people from seeking knowledge is wrong, because seeking knowledge is an obligation, and it can only be achieved by learning, not by inspiration. This is one of the misguided Sufi myths, because action without knowledge is misguidance, and hoping to acquire knowledge without learning is an illusion.” (<em>Thalath Muhadarat fi’l-‘Ilm wa’l-Da’wah</em>)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I heard that the piece of cloth with which a woman covers her face in ihram should not touch the nose; how correct is that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\tThe Muslim woman \tis required to cover her face in front of men who are non-mahrams to her. If \tshe is in ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, she should cover her face with something \tother than the niqab, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \tupon him) forbade the woman in ihram to wear niqab.</p>\n<p>\tThis has been \texplained, with evidence, in fatwa no. <a href=\"/en/answers/172289\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">172289</a></p>\n<p>\tIf the woman in \tihram covers her face with her head cover, jilbaab and the like, then she \tdoes not have to create a distance between the cover and her face, because \tthere is no report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \thim) to indicate that this is required. Rather the actions of women at the \ttime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicate that \tthis is not required.</p>\n<p>\t‘Aa’ishah (may \tAllah be pleased with her) said: The riders used to pass us when we were \twith the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in \tihram. When they drew close to us, one of us would let down her jilbaab from \ther head over her face, and when they had passed us we would uncover it \tagain.</p>\n<p>\tIt is well-known \tthat the jilbaab that is let down from the head over the face will \tinevitably touch the face.</p>\n<p>\tShaykh al-Islam \tIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa \t(26/112-113):</p>\n<p>\tIf a woman \tcovers her face with something that does not touch the face, that is \tpermissible according to consensus.</p>\n<p>\tIf it does touch \tthe face, then the correct view is that it is also permissible, and a woman \tis not required to go to the trouble of creating a distance between her \tcover and her face, whether that is with a stick or her hand or anything \telse. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) treated the \twoman’s face and hands equally (in terms of covering) and both of them are \tlike the body of a man, not like his head. The wives of the Prophet \t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to let down (their head \tcovers or jilbaabs) over their faces without paying attention to creating a \tdistance. End quote.</p>\n<p>\tThe difference \tbetween a man’s body and his head in the case of ihram is that a man is \tprohibited from covering his head with anything that clings to the head, \twhether that thing is something ordinary or otherwise. As for his body, he \tis not forbidden to cover it; rather he is only forbidden to wear clothing \tthat is tailored to fit the body. </p>\n<p>\tIbn al-Qayyim \t(may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tThe Mother of \tthe Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the \triders passed by us, one of us would let down her jilbaab from her head over \ther face. And she did not use a stick to create some distance between her \tface and the jilbaab, as some of the fuqaha’ suggest. This is not known from \tany of the women of the Sahaabah or from the Mothers of the Believers at \tall, either as an action that they did or something that was enjoined in a \tfatwa. It is impossible that this could have been one of the practices of \tihram and was not well known among them and known to everyone, elite and \tcommon folk alike.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from\tBadaa’i‘ al-Fawaa’id (2/664-665)</p>\n<p>\tShaykh ‘Abd \tal-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tIt is \tpermissible for the woman in ihram to let her head cover down over her face \tif she needs to do so, without using anything to lift it off her face. If \tthe head cover touches her face, there is no blame on her, because of the \thadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The riders \tused to pass us … and he quoted the hadith mentioned above.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from\tMajmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (16/54-55)</p>\n<p>\tHe also said \t(16/56):</p>\n<p>\tWith regard to \twhat many women do, of using a stick under the head cover to lift it off the \tface, there is no basis for that in sharee‘ah as far as we know. If that \twere prescribed, the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \twould have explained it to his ummah, and he could not have remained silent \tabout it.

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (2914) and Abu Dawood (1464) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Qur’an: ‘Read, and ascend, and recite as you used to recite in the [previous] world, for your status will be according to the last verse that you recite.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-‘Azeemabaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It will be said”: i.e., when people are admitted to Paradise</p>\n<p>“to the companion of the Qur’an” i.e., the one who consistently recites it and acts upon it, not the one who reads it and does not act upon it.</p>\n<p>“Read and ascend” i.e., to the higher levels of Paradise or of closeness to Allah.</p>\n<p>“”and recite” i.e., do not be hasty in your recitation in Paradise</p>\n<p>“as you used to recite” that is, in your reading</p>\n<p>“in the [previous] world”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From this hadeeth it may be understood that this greater reward will not be attained except by one who memorized the Qur’an and learned how to recite it properly and in a precise manner, as it should be done.</p>\n<p>End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma‘bood fi Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood (4/237).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/169485\">169485</a> we discussed what is meant by the virtue mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above; it is only attained by the one who memorises the Qur’an and acts upon it; please see the question mentioned for more information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth mentioned above speaks about the virtue of the companion of the Qur’an. That does not mean that the one who has not memorized the Qur’an will be of the lowest status in Paradise. Rather the hadeeth refers to a particular virtue for a particular deed; it does not indicate that the higher levels (of Paradise) will only be attained by those who memorise or read the Qur’an. Most of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not memorise the Book of Allah, in the sense of memorising its recitation; rather they memorised it in the sense of acting upon it. So if anyone misses out on this particular reward and virtue, it is still possible for him to strive hard in whatever virtues Allah makes easy for him, such as prayer, tahajjud and qiyaam (voluntary prayers during the night); or zakaah and charity; or fasting on hot days; or constantly remembering Allah; or meeting people’s needs… Or whatever else Allah wills of different kinds of goodness and guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (3256) and Muslim (2831) narrated from Abu Sa ‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will see the people of the highest place in Paradise above them as you see the brilliant star far away on the horizon in the east or the west, because of the difference in status between them.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, is that the status of the Prophets that no one else will attain? He said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul. They are men who believed in Allah and believed in the Messengers.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (251) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises people in status?” They said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Doing wudoo’ properly at times when it is difficult to do so, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for prayer after prayer. That is constant readiness.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27075\">27075</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Conditions of Worship in Islam",
      "question": "<p>What are the conditions of worship in Islam?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“Firstly: the worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its reasons. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/4524\" target=\"_blank\">Any person who worships Allah</a> by doing an <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147608\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> that is not done for a reason proven in Shari`ah is doing an act of worship that will be rejected and is not enjoined by Allah and His Messenger.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An example of that is celebrating the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or celebrating the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, claiming that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on that night. This is not in accordance with Shari`ah so it is to be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no historical proof that the Mi'raj (ascent into heaven) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took place on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. The books of hadith that we have do not contain even a single letter that indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. It is known that this is the kind of information that cannot be accepted without sound isnads.</li>\n<li>Even if it were proven, do we have the right to innovate some kinds of worship on that date or to make it a festival? Not at all. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and saw that the Ansar had two days on which they would play, he said: “Allah has replaced these for you with something better,” and he mentioned to them ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha. This indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked any festival to be innovated in Islam apart from the Islamic festivals, of which there are three: the two annual ‘Eids, which are ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha, and the weekly festival which is Friday. Even if it were proven that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh of Rajab – which it is impossible to prove – we cannot innovate anything on that occasion without the permission of the Lawgiver.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I have said to you, bid’ah (innovation) is a serious matter which has a bad effect on the heart even if a person feels softness in his heart at that moment. For the matter will subsequently be the opposite, because if the heart rejoices in falsehood, that joy will not last, rather it will be followed by pain and regret. Every bid’ah is serious because it implies criticism of the Messenger, because this bid’ah implies that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not bring the complete Shari`ah, even though Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”&nbsp;[Al-Maidah 5:3]</p>\n<p>It is strange that you find some of those who indulge in these innovations strongly urge people to follow them, but they are negligent about matters which are more beneficial, more sound and more useful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence we say that celebrating the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab as the night in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven is a bid’ah, because it is based on something that is not mentioned in Shari`ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"2\">Secondly: the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/221178\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> should be in accordance with Shari`ah in its type or nature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if a person were to sacrifice a horse, that would be contrary to the Shari`ah in the nature of the action. Because a sacrifice can only involve an animal of the an'am class, namely a camel, a cow or a sheep.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\">Thirdly: the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/113177\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its amount. If someone were to say that he was going to pray Zuhr as six rak'ahs, would this act of worship be in accordance with Shari`ah? Not at all, because it is not in accordance with it in terms of the amount or number. If someone were to say Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah), al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty-five times following a prescribed prayer, would this be correct? The answer is that if your aim is to worship Allah by saying it this number of times because you believe this is the proper way, then you are mistaken. If you deliberately add something to what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has prescribed, but you believe that the proper way prescribed in Islam is thirty-three, then the extras are fine, because you are not suggesting that the higher number is the proper way that is prescribed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li value=\"4\">Fourthly: The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/310759\" target=\"_blank\">act of worship</a> must be in accordance with Shari`ah in how it is done.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a person does an act of worship that is acceptable in its type, amount and reason, but he goes against Shari`ah in the manner in which he does it, then it is not valid. For example, a man breaks wind etc. and does wudu, but he washes his feet and then wipes his head, then washes his hands, then washes his face – is his wudu valid? Not at all, because he has gone against Shari`ah in the way in which he did it.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"5\">Fifthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/210742\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> with regard to its timing.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if a person fasts Ramadan in Sha’ban, or in Shawwal, or he prays Zuhr before the sun has passed its zenith, or after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it – because if he prays before the sun has passed its zenith he is praying before the time has come, and if he prays after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it he is praying after the time has gone –his prayer is not valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence we say that if a person deliberately does not pray until the time for that prayer is over, with no valid excuse, his prayer will not be accepted even if he prays a thousand times. Hence we follow an important principle in this regard which is that in the case of every act of worship that is to be done at a certain time, if a person does it outside of the proper time with no valid excuse, it will not be accepted, rather it will be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The evidence for that is the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"6\">Sixthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a person stands in Muzdalifah on the day of ‘Arafah, this standing is not valid, because the act of worship is not in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. Similarly, for example, if a person were to do i'tikaf in his own house, that would not be valid, because the place of i'tikaf is the mosque. Hence it is not valid for a woman to do i'tikaf in her house, because this is not the place for i’tikaf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some of his wives had set up tents in the mosque; he told them to take them down and not to do i’tikaf, but he did not tell them to do i'tikaf in their houses. This indicates that the women should not do i'tikaf in their houses because that goes against Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So with regard to these six factors, an act of worship is not regarded as following <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/282538\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> unless it combines all six:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reason</li>\n<li>Type</li>\n<li>Amount</li>\n<li>Manner</li>\n<li>Time</li>\n<li>Place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to change imams during the prayer, starting from the second rak’ah, because the imam cannot complete the prayer or the recitation of Qur’aan because he is crying so much and he is afraid that he may make the prayer too long for those who are praying behind him, and they are on a journey or are in a hurry, so he appoints someone from the congregation to take over leading the prayer during the prayer, and they trade places and complete the prayer from that point? If what they did is not permissible what should the imam do? What should those who were praying behind him do? What should the replacement imam do?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a reason arises which prevents the imam from completing     the prayer or from continuing as the imam, he may appoint someone to take     over for him and complete the prayer with the congregation. This is the view     of the majority of te scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     al-Majmoo’ (4/142):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn al-Mundhir narrated it from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali,     ‘Ilqimah, ‘Ata’, al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Nakha’i, al-Thawri, Maalik, ashaab     al-ra’i and Ahmad, and he did not narrate from anyone that it is not     permitted to appoint someone else to take over. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They quoted as evidence the fact that when ‘Umar ibn     al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) was stabbed as he was praying,     he took the hand of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf and made him move forward, and     he led the people in the remainder of the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari,     3700.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That was done in the presence of the Sahaabah and others, and     no one objected, so there was consensus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (3/252)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the imam becomes unable to complete the prayer or to do     any of the essential parts of the prayer, that is regarded as one of the     excuses which make it permissible for him to appoint someone else to     complete the congregational prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Abu’l-Waleed al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’     (1/290):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the imam moving back because of an excuse,     there is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that this is     permissible. The excuses are of two types:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That includes something that makes the imam obliged to become     a member of the congregation, which is if he becomes unable to do any of the     obligatory parts of the prayer. In that case he should move back and make     another man move forward to complete the prayer and he should follow the new     imam. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Another example is if the imam is overcome with weeping and     he cannot complete the recitation of al-Faatihah, which is an essential part     of the prayer. In that case he should appoint a member of the congregation     to take over. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/944):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If he is unable to complete al-Faatihah, then he may appoint     someone to take over leading them in prayer, because he has become unable to     do it. And it is permissible to appoint someone else, such as if he breaks     his wudoo’ by accident or if he becomes unable during the prayer to do an     essential part of the prayer, then he may appoint someone to complete the     prayer. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam has finished reciting al-Faatihah, then he is     overcome with weeping whilst reciting Qur’aan after al-Faatihah, in that     case he may stop reciting and bow, and he does not have to do anything     else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib (may Allaah be     pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) led us in praying Fajr in Makkah, and he started to     recite Soorat al-Mu’minoon, until he came to the passage that mentions Moosa     and Haroon, when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) was overcome by coughing, so he bowed. Narrated by Muslim (455).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh     Muslim (4/177):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This hadeeth shows that it is permissible to stop reciting     and it is not makrooh to do so, if one stops for a reason. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible for him to appoint someone else to take     over in that case, because he is able to complete the prayer with the     people, doing only the essential parts of the prayer. There is no need for     him to continue reciting with difficulty when weeping, because reciting     something else in addition to al-Faatihah is not obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In Mawaahib al-Jaleel (2/136) it is narrated that     al-Maaziri said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He should not appoint someone to take over if he is prevented     from reciting part of the soorah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In such cases it is recommended that he try to control     himself as much as he can, so that he will not cause any hardship to the     other worshippers if his weeping goes on for too long, as that will have     some negative effects. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked in    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (11/342): What is your opinion on the phenomenon     of weeping loudly?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I have advised many of those who have gotten in touch with me     to avoid doing this and that it is not appropriate, because it annoys people     and causes hardship to them, and it distracts other worshippers and those     who are reading Qur’aan. What the believer should do is strive not to let     his voice be heard if he is weeping, and he should beware of showing off,     for the shaytaan may lead him to show off. He should not annoy anyone with     his voice, or disturb them. But it is known that some people do not do that     by choice, rather they get overwhelmed without meaning to. In this case it     is forgivable if he cannot help it. It is proven that when the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited Qur’aan, his chest would     heave like the boiling of a cauldron because of weeping. And it is narrated     that when Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) read Qur’aan, he could     not make the people hear it because of weeping. And it is narrated that     ‘Umar’s sobs could be heard from behind the rows (of worshippers). But this     does not mean that the voice should be raised in weeping, rather it is     something that overwhelmed them because of their fear of Allaah. So if a     person is overcome with weeping and cannot help it, there is no sin on him     for that. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From the above it is clear that if your imam had finished     reciting al-Faatihah, then he made a mistake when he appointed someone else     to take over, and he should not do that again. But the ruling on your prayer     and his is that the prayer is valid, in sha Allaah, and no one should be     told to repeat it, because you were all unaware of this ruling. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam is overcome with weeping whilst reciting     al-Faatihah, then what he did by appointing someone else to take over was     correct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The prostration of everything in the universe to Allaah",
      "question": "<p>It says in Soorat al-Hajj 22:18 that the dawaab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.) prostrate to Allaah. What is the nature of this prostration?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Note that this universe and all the created beings in it is     in thrall to Allaah, whether by choice or by force. The believer worships     Allaah by choice and is rewarded for his worship. Even though the kaafir may     be alienated from his Lord and failing to worship Him, the atoms of his body     and everything in him is worshipping Him and glorifying Him, but because our     understanding and perception are limited, we are unaware of that tasbeeh     (glorification of Allaah) and unable to understand its nature. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein,     glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you     understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing,     Oft-Forgiving”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:44]</p>\n<p>What this means is that     every created being is in a state of submission to Allaah and worships Him     in a manner appropriate to its situation. The sun, moon, stars, trees and     animals are all in a state of subjugation to Allaah and prostrate to Him,     and all of them worship Him in an appropriate manner. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“See you not that     whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the     moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawaabb     [moving (living) creatures, beasts], and many of mankind prostrate     themselves to Allaah. But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is     justified. And whomsoever Allaah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily,     Allaah does what He wills”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:18]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Have they not     observed things that Allaah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the     right and to the left, making prostration unto Allaah, and they are lowly?</p>\n<p>And to Allaah     prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the     moving (living) creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they     worship their Lord (Allaah) with humility]”</p>\n<p>[al-Nahl 16:48-49]</p>\n<p>    Imaam Ibn Katheer said: Allaah is telling us of His Might,     Majesty and Pride, for everything submits to Him and all things and     creatures humble themselves before Him, inanimate objects and animals, and     those which are accountable among mankind and the jinn, and the angels.     Allaah tells us that everything that has a shadow that inclines towards the     right and towards the left – i.e., morning and evening – prostrates to     Allaah. Mujaahid said: When the sun passes its zenith everything prostrates     to Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has confirmed that all beings prostrate to Him, and He     has explained how some of them prostrate, which is by the inclining of its     shadow towards the right and the left. It does not mean that everything     prostrates on seven parts of the body; that applies only to the Muslims. The     prostration of all other beings is in accordance with their nature. The fact     that this prostration is prostration in the real sense is indicated by the     apparent meaning of the text, because there is no valid reason for not     interpreting the text as it appears to be, so we must accept it. That is     also supported by the fact that the prostration of the sun, moon, stars,     trees and animals is mentioned in conjunction with the prostration of the     angels and humans, which indicates that this is prostration in a real sense     for all the entities mentioned. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah     have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Prostration is a form of humility, so the prostration which     includes all creatures implies the utmost submission and humility. For every     created thing submits to His greatness and humbles itself before His might     and power. This does not mean that everything prostrates like human beings     do, on seven parts of the body, putting the forehead on the ground. This     kind of prostration is only for human beings. Some other nations bow but do     not prostrate, and that is their prostration. Allaah says (interpretation of     the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with     humility) and say: “Forgive us”’</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:58]</p>\n<p>It was said that this     means enter it bowing, and some of them prostrate on their sides like the     Jews. Sujood (prostration) is a generic term but because the way in which     Muslims prostrate is so well known, many people think that this is how     everything prostrates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Jaami’ al-Rasaa’il, 1/27&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is known that     everything prostrates according to its nature, and the prostration of these     created entities does not mean that they put their foreheads on the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/284&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This prostration includes the submission and humbling of     these created entities to Allaah and their surrendering to His Lordship,     Might and Sovereignty. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is the prostration of     humility and submission, for everything submits to His Lordship, humbles     itself before His Might and is subject to His Sovereignty.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/107&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The prostration of these created entities is a prostration in     a real sense as befits each of these entities. So man prostrates in the     manner that suits him, in the manner that is well known, on seven parts of     the body. The sun prostrates in the manner that suits it, as mentioned in     the saheeh hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said:     “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu     Dharr when the sun had set, ‘Do you know where it went?’ I said, ‘Allaah and     His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘It has gone to prostrate beneath the     Throne, then it asks for permission to rise, but soon it will prostrate and     its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask for permission to rise     and that will not be granted to it, and it will be said to it, “Go back from     whence you came,” and it will rise from the west. This is what Allaah says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term     (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing”</p>\n<p>    [Yaa-Seen 36:38].’”</p>\n<p>    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3199)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So it prostrates in a real sense, as is suited to the sun,     but how does it prostrate to Allaah beneath the Throne? Allaah knows best     how this prostration happens. The apparent meaning of the hadeeth proves     that what this prostration means is not simply submission to the command of     Allaah and obedience to Him. Indeed, it is submission, humility and     surrender by prostrating in a real sense, but we do not understand how it     happens. Similarly it is said that the moon, the trees, the animals and all     other entities prostrate in a manner that suits them. What the believer     should do is not to let the fact that he does not know how some entities     prostrate prevent him from believing in this prostration, rather he must     believe in what Allaah has told him about other entities prostrating to Him.</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Approximately one year ago I got married to a righteous young man, and now we have done the marriage contract.</p>\n<p>But before the contract he used to hold my hand and kiss me. I know that it is haram (impermissible) according to sharee’ah (Islamic law). Will Allah forgive me now that we have done the marriage contract or does the sin remain and do I have to ask for forgiveness and offer expiation?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Many people use the word “engagement” to refer to the period following the marriage contract and before consummation of the marriage. If this is what is referred to in the question, then there is no sin on you for what happened between you, because simply by doing the marriage contract, the woman becomes the wife of the man and there is no sin on either of them for enjoying the other.</p>\n<p>But if what you mean by engagement is simply promising to get married and agreeing to do so without doing the marriage contract, then what happened between you is haram. During this period Islam does not permit anything more than looking so that both the man and woman can be sure that they want to go ahead and get engaged. What you both have to do – in this case – is to repent, seek forgiveness and regret these actions. The marriage contract between you is not sufficient to expiate for these sins, rather you have to repent and seek forgiveness.</p>\n<p>With regard to expiation, there is no specific expiation for what has happened between you, but it is prescribed for the one who repents to do a lot of righteous deeds such as offering nawafil (voluntary) prayers, fasting, giving charity and so on. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death).” [20:82]</p>\n<p>For more information please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3215\"> 3215</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12182/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12182</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2572\"> 2572</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to make an antidote to scorpion stings from the venom of the scorpion itself? In general, is it permissible to give antidote is extracted from the venom or secretions of animals, or from the animal itself, such as its body?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>What is known in the world of medicine is that the British doctor Edward Jenner (1749-1823 CE) was the one who discovered vaccination – or inoculation – as a means of preventing smallpox. The author Paul Vallely said in an article entitled “How Islamic inventors changed the world” that inoculation was known to the Muslims before others, as he said: “The technique of inoculation was not invented by Jenner and Pasteur but was devised in the Muslim world and brought to Europe from Turkey by the wife of the English ambassador to Istanbul in 1724 CE.”</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars disallowed seeking treatment before becoming ill, but their view is not correct.</p>\n<p>Shaykh `Abd al-`Aziz ar-Rajihi (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>The ruling on giving vaccinations before disease occurs is that it is permissible, such as giving vaccines for meningitis and cholera. The evidence that that is permissible includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is soundly narrated in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em>, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats seven dates of Madinah in the morning, no witchcraft or poison will harm him.” So this hadith clearly refers to protection against disease before it happens, and it comes under the heading of taking permissible measures to ward off harm.</li>\n<li>The scholars are unanimously agreed that food and drink protect against the harm of hunger and thirst, and wearing thick clothing and woollen garments protects against the harm of cold, and the mujahid’s wearing armour and taking up weapons protects against the harm of the enemy. All of this comes under the heading of protecting oneself against ill health before it occurs, and all people are agreed on that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fawa’id fil-`Aqidah</em>, 18.</p>\n<p>See also the words of Shaykh `Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) in the answer to question no. 20276.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>With regard to the ruling on consuming poison, we should differentiate between taking poison and using it for medicinal purposes. Previously the scholars disagreed on the ruling concerning that in terms of whether it is impure (najis) or pure (tahir). The correct view is that it is pure, but it is not permissible to consume poison with the aim of committing suicide. There is a warning against doing that in a clear, authentic text.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be in the Fire of Hell, throwing himself down therein for ever and ever. Whoever takes poison and kills himself, his poison will be in his hand and he will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that piece of iron will be in his hand and he will be stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell, forever and ever.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5442; Muslim, 109).</p>\n<p>As for the ruling on using poison for medicinal treatment, it is permissible if it is proven to be of benefit, but it should be prescribed by a skilled doctor. In the past, they used to use it for kings to protect them, so that poison would have no effect on them if someone wanted to kill them with it. It has also proven to be effective for those who live in the wilderness or in lands where snakes and scorpions are common.</p>\n<p>Imam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to taking medicine in which there is some venom or poison that is usually safe to take, there is no sin on the one who consumes it, because he is not consuming it in order to harm himself or to intoxicate himself, even if it happens to cause some kind of intoxication.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Umm</em>, 1/88.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah said:</p>\n<p>With regard to medicines that contain venom or poison, if using them will most likely lead to death or insanity, it is not permissible to consume them, but if the medicine is most likely to be safe and there is the hope of benefitting from it, then the view that it is permissible is the right view, as is the case with other medicines.</p>\n<p>But it may be that it is not permissible, because he is exposing himself to the risk of death, so it is not permissible, just as it is not permissible for one who consumes it without intending it as medicinal treatment.</p>\n<p>But the first view is more correct, because with many medicines there is some fear of harm [side effects], but it is permissible to use them in order to ward off greater harm. So if we say that it is prohibited to consume it, then it comes under the category of prohibited things like alcohol and so on, but if we say that it is permissible, then it comes under the category of permissible medications, like any other medicine.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Mughni</em>, 1/447.</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar al-`Asqallani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to simply taking poison, it is not prohibited in all cases, because it may be permissible to use a small amount of it, when it is mixed with something else that reduces its harm, if there is some benefit in that.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fat-h al-Bari</em>, 10/248.</p>\n<p>Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to use poison or venom for medicinal purposes, but it is not permissible to consume it otherwise. End quote from <em>Tafsir al-Qurtubi</em>, 2/220.</p>\n<p>In <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em>, 25/257, it says:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to use poison or venom for medicinal purposes, even according to those who say that it is impure, provided that it can be used in a safe way and there is the hope that it will be beneficial, by way of &nbsp;choosing the less harmful of two options and warding off the greater harm, on condition that you seek the advice of a Muslim doctor of good character, or you have good knowledge of what can be used for medicinal purposes, and there is no alternative that could treat the problem. End quote.</p>\n<p>The same applies to all other vaccines and antidotes. All of that is on condition that it should be prescribed by a skilled doctor, in the light of experiments that led to certain results, or almost certain results, and on condition that no harm will result from taking it, and whatever temporary negative consequences (side effects) occur, such as fever and so on, are negligible in comparison to the great benefit of that vaccination or antidote.

      "title": "Is it Sunnah to do ghusl on the Day of ‘Arafah?",
      "question": "<p>Is it Sunnah to do ghusl on the Day of ‘Arafah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;It is not stipulated that one should be in a state of purity for the standing in ‘Arafah. The scholars are agreed that it is valid for a woman who is menstruating or a person who is in a state of janaabah to stand in ‘Arafah. However it is mustahabb (recommended) for the one who stands in ‘Arafah to be free of impurity, both major and minor, because he is going to be mentioning the name of Allah, may He be exalted, and it is mustahabb to do wudoo’ before mentioning the name of Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82029\" target=\"_blank\">82029</a> .</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;It is proven from more than one of the Sahaabah that they did ghusl for the day of ‘Arafah – such as Ibn Mas‘ood, Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them).</p>\n<p>Al-Bayhaqi (6124) narrated that Zaadhaan said: A man asked ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) about bathing. He said: Bathe every day if you wish. He said: No, (I mean) ghusl (in the sense of purification). He said: On Fridays, the day of ‘Arafah, the Day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) and the day of (Eid) al-Fitr.</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’ (1/177).</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (45/323)</p>\n<p>The Shaafa‘is, Hanbalis and Maalikis – according to one opinion – are of the&nbsp; view that it is Sunnah to do ghusl for the standing in ‘Arafah, because of the report narrated from ‘Ali, Ibn Mas‘ood and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), that they used to do ghusl when they went to ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is an act of worship for which people gather in one place, so it is prescribed to do ghusl for it, as in the case of Jumu‘ah and Eid prayers.</p>\n<p>The Hanafis and the Maalikis, according to the official opinion, are of the view that doing ghusl for the day of ‘Arafah is mustahabb. End quote.</p>\n<p>According to the fuqaha’, mustahabb refers to an unconfirmed Sunnah (Sunnah ghayr mu’akkadah), i.e., something that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do as a consistent practice.</p>\n<p>See: Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen (2/411)</p>\n<p>Thus it becomes clear that the four madhhabs are agreed that it is prescribed to do ghusl on the day of ‘Arafah, and that the one who does it will be rewarded. The evidence for it being prescribed is the action of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them).</p>\n<p>Ibn Maajah (1316) narrated from al-Faakih ibn Sa‘d that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do ghusl on the day of (Eid) al-Fitr, the Day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) and the day of ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>But this is a mawdoo‘ (fabricated) hadith, as stated by al-Albaani in Da‘eef Ibn Maajah.</p>\n<p>It was also narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Ghusl on these days is obligatory: Friday, the day of (Eid) al-Fitr, the Day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha) and the day of ‘Arafah.” But this was classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in Da‘eef al-Jaami‘ (3929)</p>\n<p>In fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/81949\" target=\"_blank\">81949</a> we stated that it is mustahabb for the one who wants to gather with the people to do ghusl, clean himself and put on perfume. That includes ghusl for the standing in ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;It should be understood that doing ghusl for the day of ‘Arafah is not for every Muslim; rather it is only for the pilgrim, because this is what is narrated from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and because it is bathing for the purpose of gathering with people, and the gathering only takes place in ‘Arafah.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>There is no report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from his companions of any ghusl in Hajj except three: ghusl when entering ihram, ghusl when entering Makkah, and ghusl on the day of ‘Arafah. End quote.&nbsp;Mamoo‘ al-Fataawa (26/132)</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;The words Sunnah and mustahabb are two words with one meaning, according to the terminology of the fuqaha’.</p>\n<p>Some of them differentiate between them.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What is mustahabb is what is masnoon (Sunnah), which is what is enjoined, but not by way of making it binding to do it, because if it was enjoined by way of making it binding to do it, it would be waajib (obligatory).</p>\n<p>The ruling on that which is mustahabb is that the one who does it in compliance with what is prescribed will be rewarded, but the one who does not do it will not be punished. However the reward for doing that which is mustahabb or masnoon is less than the reward for doing that which is obligatory, on the basis of textual and rational evidence.</p>\n<p>With regard to the textual evidence, it is the words of Allah, may He be exalted, in the hadith qudsi: “My slave does not draw closer to Me by means of anything dearer to Me than that which I have made obligatory upon him.” So an obligatory prayer of two rak‘ahs is dearer to Allah than a voluntary (naafil) prayer of two rak‘ahs.</p>\n<p>With regard to the rational evidence, the fact that Allah has made obligatory actions obligatory indicates that they are more emphatically prescribed, and that the accountable person needs to do them more than he needs to do the voluntary (naafil) actions.</p>\n<p>Is there a difference between mustahabb and masnoon?</p>\n<p>The answer is that some of the scholars differentiated between them by stating that mustahabb refers to that which is proven by analogy (qiyaas) and masnoon refers to that which is proven by a Sunnah, i.e., by evidence.</p>\n<p>But the correct view is that there is no difference between them, and the matter is one of terminology. According to the Hanbalis there is no difference between them, so it makes no difference whether we say “It is mustahabb to wash each part three times when doing wudoo’” or “it is Sunnah to wash each part three times when doing wudoo’”. This is simply the matter of terminology; in other words, if someone were to say in his book, “If I say something is Sunnah, I mean that is it proven by a Sunnah, and if I say that it is mustahabb, I mean that it is proven by analogy (qiyaas),” then he carries on with this terminology, he is not to be denounced for that.&nbsp;End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (6/421)</p>\n<p>See also: Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ by al-Bahooti (1/87); Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj by ar-Ramli (2/105)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Does teaching English to the imam of the mosque come under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression?",
      "question": "<p>We have a new imam in our community. He graduated from al Azhar. Although there is some good points about him, he seems to have an incorrect manhaj and is a little bit loose. He does some of the smaller things such as keeping a very short beard and other things. My question is, my parents commanded me to teach him english. Will this be part of the ayah which says do not help each other in wrongdoing since he may use this english to teach this incorrect manhaj. For the time being, there seems to be more good than bad from him, however, he may change as he stays in this kaffir country. Please advice me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What your parents have     asked you to do of teaching this imam does not come under the heading of     cooperating in sin and transgression. The fact that this imam goes against     sharee’ah in some issues means that you have to advise him and remind him     lest he continue with those infractions and fall into others, especially as     you are going to form a special relationship with him by teaching him     English.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cooperating in sin and     transgression would be the case if you were to be the cause of some sin or     continuing it or spreading it, or if you helped the one who is doing it with     some idea or money or physical help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of cooperating in     sin and transgression include: renting out stores to riba-based banks or     stores that sell haraam things, joining a businessman in manufacturing,     selling or buying haraam things, or helping followers of bid’ah (innovation)     financially or by enabling them to speak to the Muslims, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the verse     (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and     At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in     sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5;2], Allaah enjoins His believing     slaves to help one another to do good deeds, which is righteousness, and to     avoid bad deeds, which refers to piety; and He forbids them to help one     another in falsehood or cooperate in sin and haraam actions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer     (1/12, 13)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because this imam has some     good qualities, we hope that you can strengthen them and help him to fulfil     them and attain more. This will be cooperating in righteousness and piety.     As for his bad qualities, we hope that you will denounce them and advise him     to give them up, and this will also come under the heading of cooperating in     righteousness and piety and the sincere advice that is required of Muslims.     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the     fear about this imam being influenced by staying in the land of kufr does     not apply only to him, rather it applies to him, to you and to all the     Muslims. What we have seen and heard is sufficient proof that people are     influenced.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have previously stated     that it is not permissible to stay in a kaafir country unless one has a     legitimate shar’i excuse and meets the conditions laid down by sharee’ah.

      "title": "Did the Prophet appoint ‘Ali as khaleefah?",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on people who claim that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) as khaleefah, and say that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) conspired against him?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    This opinion is not known among any of the Muslim groups     apart from the Shi’ah, and it is a false view which has no basis in the     ahaadeeth that have been proven from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him). On the contrary, a great deal of evidence     shows that the khaleefah after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him     and with all the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him)). But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) did not state that clearly and he did not appoint him in any     definitive sense; rather he gave commands which indicated that, when he told     him to lead the people in prayer when he (the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him)) was sick, and when he told him about the     leadership of the Muslim community after his death, saying, “Allaah and the     believers will only accept Abu Bakr.” Hence the Sahaabah (may Allaah be     pleased with them) gave their allegiance (bay’ah) to Abu Bakr and they were     unanimously agreed that Abu Bakr was the best among them. It was reported in     the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Sahaabah     (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to say during the Prophet’s life:     “The best of this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then     ‘Uthmaan,” and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     approved of their saying that. Mutawaatir reports from ‘Ali (may Allaah be     pleased with him) show that he used to say, “The best of this ummah after     its Prophet is Abu Bakr then ‘Umar.” And he (may Allaah be pleased with him)     used to say, “No one is brought to me who prefers me over them, but I will     whip him with the hadd punishment for telling lies.” He never claimed that     he was the best of this ummah, or that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had appointed him as khaleefah. He     never said that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) had wronged     him and taken away his rights. When Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with     her) died he gave a second pledge of allegiance (bay’ah) to Abu Bakr, as     confirmation of his first pledge and to demonstrate to the people that he     was with the jamaa’ah (the main group of Muslims) and that he had no     reservations in his heart against giving his allegiance to Abu Bakr (may     Allaah be pleased with them all). When ‘Umar was stabbed, he appointed six     of those whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     had testified were guaranteed Paradise, for them to appoint one of their     number as ‘Umar’s successor; among these six was ‘Ali, who never denounced     ‘Umar, either whilst he was still alive or after his death. ‘Ali did not say     that he was more entitled than any of them to be khaleefah, so how can     anyone have the right to tell lies about the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and say that he appointed ‘Ali as     khaleefah? ‘Ali himself never made any such claim, and none of the Sahaabah     claimed that for him. Rather they were unanimously agreed that the caliphate     of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan was valid; ‘Ali acknowledged that and he     cooperated with all of them in jihad, shoora (consultation), etc. Moreover,     the Muslims after the Sahaabah were agreed upon that which the Sahaabah had     been agreed on. After all this, it is not permissible for anyone or for any     group, Shi’ah or others, to claim that ‘Ali was the appointed successor, or     that the caliphate before him was false. Similarly, no one has the right to     say that the Sahaabah wronged ‘Ali and took away his rights. Rather this is     the falsest of falsehoods, and it is thinking badly of the Companions of the     Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),     including ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him and with them all).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has protected the ummah of Muhammad  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) and kept it from agreeing on misguidance.     It was narrated in a saheeh report in many ahaadeeth that the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will     continue to adhere to the truth and to prevail.” It is impossible that the     noblest generation of this ummah could agree on falsehood, supposedly the     caliphate of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan. No one says this who believes in     Allaah and the Last Day, and no one says this who has the slightest insight     into the rulings of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n",

If He so     willed, He could punish you for this sin and you would have a bad end. Think     about how Allah has concealed your sin. What would you do if your husband     and other people found out what you are doing; it would be a big scandal.     How would your life be after that? So hasten to repent before Allah hastens     your death or punishment, in which case regret would be to no avail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The gate of repentance is open and Allah accepts the     repentant slave and rejoices over him; He forgives him and accepts his     repentance no matter what his sin. The one who repent from sin is like one who did not sin at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah to guide you.</p>\n",

Concerning the virtues of this action, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be like this in Paradise” – and he gestured with his forefinger and middle finger, holding them apart slightly. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5304) and Muslim (2983).</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: “The one who sponsors an orphan” is the one who takes care of his affairs, spending on him, clothing him, disciplining him, educating him and so on. This virtue is attained by the one who sponsors him from his own wealth or from the orphan’s wealth on the basis of shar‘i guardianship.

Assistance for families who sponsor orphans: this assistance is granted to the families who undertake to sponsor and care for orphans on behalf of the Ministry, based on Article 14 of the by-law on children needing care, issued under Statement no. 612 on 13/5/1395 AH, which says: ‘The ministry will grant monthly assistance to the party caring for the child, starting from the date the child was handed over to them, provided that said party wants this assistance.’ This assistance will be disbursed in the following manner:</p>\n<p>2,000 riyals per month for a child under the age of six years</p>\n<p>3,000 riyals per month for a child over the age of six years.</p>\n<p>3.. Assistance at the end of the sponsorship period: Statement no. 1430, dated 13/10/1395 AH, determined that financial assistance will be granted to every family at the end of the period of caring for children with unknown parents, to the tune of 20,000 riyals.</p>\n<p>End quote from the Ministry’s website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mosa.gov.sa/portal/cdisplay.php?cid=10\">http://www.mosa.gov.sa/portal/cdisplay.php?cid=10</a></p>\n<p>It appears from this statement that this allowance is given to the family and is not to be spent on the orphan, based on the fact that it is paid after the sponsorship period ends.</p>\n<p>Based on that, this allowance belongs to the family, so there is no blame on the family for benefitting from it or from whatever is surplus to the orphan’s needs.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Thus they came from the same source, and as that is the case there cannot be any contradiction or conflict between them, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.} [An-Nisa’ 4:82]</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, describes the Glorious Quran as “confirming” the Books that came before it, and that which confirms something cannot contradict or conflict with it.

It is because these two Books have fallen prey to distortion and alteration, with things being taken away, added and changed. That is in addition to the fact that the sources and manuscripts that have come down to us today cannot be trusted.</p>\n<p>This is what explains any differences that researchers or students find between these two Books and the Glorious Quran which has been transmitted to us in a Mutawatir fashion (i.e., narrated by so many from so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie), as is attested by both believers and nonbelievers.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Biblical_Mentions_of_Ibrahims_Journey_to_Makkah\">Biblical Mentions of Ibrahim’s Journey to Makkah</span></h3>\n<p>Nevertheless we say that Ibrahim’s arrival in the land of Makkah Al-Mukarramah – and indeed his building of the Sacred House – are historical events that are attested to in the Torah and other ancient historical books.</p>\n<p>We cannot deny the fact that there are different interpretations of these texts of the Torah and so on, and that the context is open to different interpretations. Our aim here is to confirm that such indications exist. However, the matter should be left to scholars to examine the story in the Old Testament, in order to reach a definitive conclusion.</p>\n<p>These references include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the book of Genesis 16:7 it says, after mentioning the story of Ibrahim (Abraham) going in unto Hajar (Hagar) and her becoming pregnant, then Sarai’s [Sarah’s] complaint to Ibrahim about her:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Biblical quotations in English are taken from the King James Version (KJV); some place names have been changed, followed by the place name, in brackets, that is mentioned in the KJV. This is done in line with the point the author is making – see below]</p>\n<p>And when Sarai [Sarah] dealt hardly [harshly] with her, she fled from her face.</p>\n<p>7&nbsp;And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to the Hijaz (Shur).</p>\n<p>8&nbsp;And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>13&nbsp;And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</p>\n<p>14&nbsp;Wherefore the well was called Be’er lahai roi (Well of the Living One Who sees me); behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>\n<p>See how the name of the Hijaz is mentioned, and Hajar’s departure to that place, after which the blessing of the “Well of the Living One Who sees me” is bestowed by Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted; this is the Well of Zamzam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 13:1-18 it says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, towards the Qiblah (into the south).</p>\n<p>2&nbsp;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p>\n<p>3&nbsp;And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</p>\n<p>4&nbsp;Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>18&nbsp;Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 20:1 it also says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the land of the qiblah (the south country), and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>\n<p>We have quoted these texts [in the original Arabic of this article] from the Torah as translated into Arabic by Sa`id Al-Fayyumi, (d. 943 AH); the King James Version of the Bible has been used here].</p>\n<p>He was the first one to translate the Old Testament into Arabic. He also wrote a commentary for most of its books. We have not found this Torah anywhere else except in the book of Idris `Abizah entitled Madhkal ila Dirasat at-Tawrat wa Naqdiha ma`a Tarjamatihi Al-`Arabiyyah li Sa`diyya Ka’un Al-Fayyumi (Introduction to the Study and Critique of the Torah, accompanied by its Translation into Arabic by Sa`diyya Ka’un Al-Fayyumi).</p>\n<p>In other well-known translations of the Torah [into Arabic], instead of the Hijaz it mentions “by a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to Shur” (Genesis 16:7), and instead of the Qiblah it mentions “the south” (Genesis 13:1).</p>\n<p>[Translator’s note: some English translations say “Negev” instead of “the south’; in the Bible, this word is used for the direction “south”]</p>\n<p>For more information please see (in Arabic): Nabi Ard Al-Janub (Prophet of the Southern Land) by Jamal Ad-Din Ash-Sharqawi, p. 18-109)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Genesis 21:21 it says of Isma‘eel (peace be upon him):</li>\n</ul>\n<p>21&nbsp;And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>\n<p>This is how it appears in the Samaritan Torah (also known as the Samaritan Pentateuch), and in Al-Fayyumi’s translation of the Torah.</p>\n<p>Although many passages in the Torah suggest that Paran is in Palestine, Imam Al-Qarrafi said in his book Al-Ajwibah Al-Fakhirah (p. 165): Paran is Makkah, according to the consensus of the People of the Book. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in Al-Jawab As-Sahih liman baddala Din Al-Masih, 5/200):</p>\n<p>There is no difference of opinion between the Muslims and the People of the Book concerning the fact that Paran is Makkah. But if they say that it is not Makkah, there is nothing strange in that, because they are known for their distortions and fabrications.</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said concerning the region around Mount Hira’ in Makkah:</p>\n<p>That place is called Faran (Paran) to this day. (End quote)</p>\n<p>Abdul Haqq Vidyarthi (d. 1978 CE) stated in his famous book Muhammad in World Scriptures:</p>\n<p>In the Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch (Torah), which was published in 1851 CE, it says that Paran is located in the Hijaz, as follows:</p>\n<p>“And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt” (Genesis 21:21).</p>\n<p>This translation remained in circulation for a long time, but when the Muslims alerted the Christian world to this prophecy, and that it constituted testimony to the truth of this Noble Prophet, the translation was changed. End quote</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Old Testament, in Psalms 84:5-6, 10, there is mention of the valley of Baca. This passage, in the King James Version (KJV), reads as follows:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5&nbsp;Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>\n<p>6&nbsp;Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>10&nbsp;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand (elsewhere).</p>\n<p>There is no valley on earth called Baca (or Bakkah) that contains a house of worship and a spring of water (Zamzam), in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, other than Makkah Al-Mukarramah.</p>\n<p>Baca (Bakkah) is one of the names of Makkah. This name is mentioned in the Glorious Quran, where Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning)”</p>\n<p>{Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-`Alamin (the mankind and jinns).} [Al `Imran 3:96]</p>\n<p>But the translators and commentators of the Old Testament distorted the word Baca to buka’ [weeping or crying; the Hebrew cognate denotes the same meaning], even though the meanings of place names should not be translated; rather the name should be transliterated, and even though the meaning of the (original) name has nothing to do with crying or weeping, as a result of their desire to eliminate all references to anything that is proven in the Glorious Quran, such distortions occurred.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we say:</p>\n<p>Even if nothing was mentioned in the Old Testament concerning Ibrahim’s journey to the Hijaz, that does not indicate that this journey did not happen at all.</p>\n<p>The well-known academic principle says that the fact that a thing is not mentioned does not mean that it did not happen. In other words, denying that something happened should take the form of a negative statement.</p>\n<p>The fact that no mention is made of its happening does not necessarily mean that it did not happen; rather the reason why it was not mentioned may be that it was omitted, forgotten, summarized in brief, and the like.</p>\n<p>If you find news of something in one newspaper, then you find that it is not mentioned at all in another newspaper, the fact that it is not mentioned in the latter does not mean that it did not happen. Whoever thinks in such terms is lacking in reason and is making no sense.</p>\n<p>This is also applicable in the case under discussion here.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we were to quote the words of non-Muslims who have investigated the story of the Ka`bah and who really built it, and have determined that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is the one who built it, this article would become far too long. But we will limit ourselves to quoting one of the most famous of contemporary history books, The Story of Civilization, by Will Durant. This book is composed of forty-two volumes in which the author discusses the history of most civilizations, including the history of the Arabian Peninsula, concerning which he says: “It (the Ka`bah) was built the fourth time by Abraham and Ishmael, his son from Hagar.

(See:&nbsp;Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah,&nbsp;17/302) and&nbsp;Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti‘,&nbsp;13/535)</p>\n<p>If we say that custody transfers to the child’s father, then if he allows the child to remain with his mother who has remarried, and she is suitable for the responsibility of custody, and her second husband agrees: then there is no objection.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the mother’s mother may give up custody to her daughter who has remarried.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Custody is the right of the one who can take care of the child, but it is not a duty.</p>\n<p>Based on that, if he or she wants to give up custody to the next in line, it is permissible for him or her to do that.\" (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`,&nbsp; 13/536)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Who_gets_child_custody_after_reaching_the_age_of_seven\">Who gets child custody after reaching the age of seven?</span></h3>\n<p>If the woman has not remarried and the child reaches the age of seven years,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the child is male, he is given the choice between his father and his mother, and he will live with the one whom he chooses, because of the report narrated by An-Nasa’i (3496) and Abu Dawud (2277) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard a woman who came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when I was sitting with him and said: O Messenger of Allah, my husband wants to take my son away even though he brings me water from the well of Abu `Inabah and is of benefit to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Draw lots for him.”</p>\n<p>Her husband said: Who is disputing my right to my child?</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said [to the child]: “This is your father and this is your mother; take the hand of whichever of them you wish.”</p>\n<p>And the child took the hand of his mother, and she took him away.<br>This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Abu Dawud.</p>\n<p>This is the view of the Hanbalis and Shafi`is (may Allah have mercy on them).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the child is female, she may also be given the choice, according to Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The mother has more right to her until the girl gets married or begins to menstruate.”</p>\n<p>Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The mother has more right to her until she gets married and the husband consummates the marriage with her.”</p>\n<p>Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The father has more right to her, because the father has more right to ensure her wellbeing.” (See:&nbsp;Al-Mawsu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah,&nbsp;17/314-317)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"When_does_child_custody_end\">When does child custody end?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/91862\" target=\"_blank\">Child custody</a> ends when the child reaches puberty and the age of maturity, at which time he may choose whichever he wishes of his parents.

As for one who is an adult of mature thinking, there is no need for custody of him, and he has the choice to live with whichever of his parents he wishes.</p>\n<p>If he is a male, then he has the right to live alone, because he has no need of them, but it is recommended for him not to live apart from them so that he will not stop honouring them.</p>\n<p>If the child is female, she cannot live on her own, and her father should prevent her from doing that, because there is no certainty that someone may come to her and corrupt her, thus bringing shame upon her and her family. If she does not have a father, then her guardian and her family should prevent her from doing that.\"(Al-Mughni&nbsp; 8/191).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Who_spends_on_a_child_during_custody\">Who spends on a child during custody?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/264146\" target=\"_blank\">Spending on the children’s maintenance</a> during custody is the duty of the father.</p>\n<p>After the custody ends, when the children reach puberty and become mature, then there is a difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the duty of spending on their maintenance.</p>\n<p>If an adult son is poor, then his rich father is obliged to spend on him. If there is no father, then his rich mother must spend on him, according to the Hanbalis, whether he is healthy or incapacitated.</p>\n<p>According to the Shafi`is, that becomes obligatory if the child is incapacitated due to a chronic condition or illness.</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;Al-Insaf&nbsp;(9/289): “The words “and his children, no matter how far the line of descent reaches” also include adult children who are healthy and strong, if they are poor. This is correct, and it is the view of the Madhhab.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ash-Shafi`i said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There should be a condition that there is something wrong with him, either in terms of discernment or physically.</p>\n<p>Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The father should spend on the boy until he reaches puberty, then if he reaches puberty and is healthy, the duty to spend on him ceases, but the duty to spend on a daughter is not waived until she gets married.”</p>\n<p>Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said something similar, except that he said that spending on daughters should continue until they get married and their husbands consummate the marriage with them, then there is no spending on them even if they get divorced. But if they get divorced before consummation of the marriage, then [the father] should still spend on them.</p>\n<p>We also have the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Hind: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children on a reasonable basis.” He did not exempt the child who is mature and healthy, and because the child is poor, he deserves maintenance from his rich father, just as is the case if the child is chronically ill or blind.\" (Al-Mughni&nbsp; 9/258)</p>\n<p>From this we may learn that so long as the father is alive, the woman does not have to spend on her children after custody ends, whether that is to buy a house or anything else, and that the father is required to spend on his daughter until she gets married.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following category: <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/51/\" target=\"_blank\">Custody</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Why did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his two companions flee from the battlefield and hide in the cave?",
      "question": "<p>According to Sahih Muslim, Book of Jihad &amp; Expeditions,</p>\n<div>4413.</div>\n<div>It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that (when the enemy got the upper hand) on the day of the Battle of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was left with only seven men from the ansar and two men from the Quraish. When the enemy advanced towards him and overwhelmed him, he said: Whoso turns them away from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Ansar came forward and fought (the enemy) until he was killed. The enemy advanced and overwhelmed him again and he repeated the words: Whoso turns them away, from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Arsar came forward and fought until he was killed. This state continued until the seven Ansar were killed (one after the other). Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to his two Companions: We have not done justice to our Companions.</div>\n<div>Did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) endanger the lives of those 7 Ansar to protect his own? That seems unfair. Why couldnt they all just hide or leave, since its OK to leave the battlefield if the enemy outnumbers tremendously. What is the wisdom behind this decision? And, why did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his 2 companions leave the battle field &amp; seek refuge in the cave?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The worst thing that a reader or researcher can do is give himself the right to pass judgement upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or upon one of his companions, on the basis of an incident that he reads about in some report, without bearing in mind what happened before and after that, and without examining or understanding the context, even if the whole story is not narrated in that particular report. What the critic must do is try to think about it and find out about it, and put together the pieces of the story that is assumed to have taken place. Only then will he be able to form an objective and fair-minded picture of what happened.</p>\n<p>When you read the hadith of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that on the day of Uhud the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was left with only seven men of the Ansaar and two men of Quraysh.</p>\n<p>When they were surrounded, he said: “Who will repel them from us and Paradise will be his, or he will be my companion in Paradise?” One of the Ansaari men went forward and fought until he was killed… and that continued until all seven had been killed. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to his two companions: “We have not been fair to our companions”,</p>\n<p>the first thing you should bear in mind is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not to be accused by any of his companions or any of the Muslims. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the Messenger of light, guidance, and mercy to all of mankind, and the future of all of humanity is connected to his call; the fate of all religions is connected to his religion. Therefore Allah ended all divine messages with him, and raised him in status and renown throughout the world, and He protected him from people, by the means that He, may He be glorified and exalted, decreed.</p>\n<p>Therefore his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would love to sacrifice their lives and their wealth for him, with no hesitation or resentment whatsoever, because by protecting the Prophet of Allah, they would be protecting the light of Tawheed, justice, righteousness and goodness throughout the world. By means of such sacrifices the message of Islam continued, and the Muslim ummah was shaped and formed, and attained the highest possible level of glory, justice, knowledge and peace. All of that was due to the immense sacrifices made by the noble Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them).</p>\n<p>Therefore it is not possible for any Muslim – let alone any Sahaabi who was defending al-Madinah al-Munawwarah alongside the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – to think of his Prophet in anything but the most perfect terms, or to think of his own life as being more deserving of protection and being given precedence than the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the best example and the best model, for he took up arms and joined his companions in defending the sanctity of the Muslims, warding off the efforts of the haters and wrongdoers, and protecting Muslim lives, honour and wealth against the ignorant tyranny of Quraysh and their arrogance in the land. Because of his courage, his companions felt more secure by being near him when the fighting grew intense.</p>\n<p>Ahmad (1346) narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When fighting grew intense and the two groups met in battle, we sought protection by drawing close to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace, you), and none of us was closer to the enemy than him.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir said in his commentary on al-Musnad: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (2627) and Muslim (2307) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the best of people, and he was the most generous of people and the most courageous of people. One night the people of Madinah were in a state of panic, and some people went out towards the sound. They were met by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who was coming back, as he had gone towards the sound before them. He was riding the horse of Abu Talhah bareback, with his sword around his neck, and he said: “Do not be afraid, do not be afraid.”</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>From this hadith we learn several things, one of which is that it highlights the courage of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he hastened to go out towards the enemy before all the people, and because he went out and found out what was going on, and came back before the people got there. End quote.</p>\n<p>What is meant by riding a horse bareback is that it had no saddle on it. This is reflective of his perfect courage (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>During the battle of Hunayn, when most of the Sahaabah fled from the battlefield, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) started urging his mule on towards the enemy, saying: “I am the Prophet and no lie; I am the son of ‘Abd al-Muttalib.” Al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: No one among the people was seen to be more courageous on that day than him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3042) and Muslim (1776).</p>\n<p>But the calamities suffered by the Muslims at Uhud were great indeed. The cheek of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was injured, he was bleeding and his tooth had been broken. He himself fought and defended his companions in the most difficult circumstances. He – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him, blessings and peace of Allah be upon him – was at the head, protecting their lives, standing between them and the aggressors of Quraysh; he did not stay safe and sound in his house or his tent at that critical moment.</p>\n<p>What the questioner is confused about is the final moments of that incident, which were very painful and difficult for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his noble Companions. He was exhausted from fighting and bearing arms, and his wound was bleeding with no treatment or anything that could stop the bleeding. He fell in a hole, and a link of chain mail got embedded in his cheek and could not be removed. His iron helmet was broken on his head, and large rocks were being hurled at him, until rumours spread that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had been killed, because of what he went through of hardships. He – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him – was approaching the age of sixty, and undoubtedly could not have the physical strength and endurance that a young man would have.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hishaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Ibn Ishaaq said: The Muslims were put to flight and the enemy slew many of them. It was a day of trial and testing in which Allah honoured several with martyrdom, until the enemy reached the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He was hit with a stone so that he fell on his side and one of his teeth was smashed, his face scored, and his lip injured. The man who wounded him was ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ishaaq said: Humayd at-Taweel told me, from Anas ibn Maalik: The incisor of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was broken on the Day of Uhud, and his face was scored. The blood began to run down his face and he began to wipe it away, saying the while: “How can people prosper who have stained their Prophet’s face with blood while he was calling them to their Lord?” So Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed concerning that the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Not for you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but for Allâh) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the Zâlimûn (polytheists, disobedients, and wrong-doers)”</p>\n<p>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:128].</p>\n<p>Ibn Hishaam said: Rabeeh ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Sa‘eed al-Khudri narrated from his father, from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri that ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas hit the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with a stone on that day, and broke his lower right incisor and wounded him in his lower lip, and that ‘Abdullah ibn Shihaab az-Zuhri struck him on the forehead, and Ibn Qam’ah wounded his cheek, so two links of chain mail became embedded in his cheek. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fell in a hole that had been made by Abu ‘Aamir so that the Muslims would fall into it without realising. ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) took the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by the hand and Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullah lifted him up until he was standing upright.</p>\n<p>End quote from Seerat Ibn Hishaam (2/79).</p>\n<p>When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had suffered so much hardship and a group of the mushrikeen gathered around him, wanting to kill him, in addition to what he had already gone through, a group of his noble companions rallied around him to defend him with their lives, as Ibn Hazm said: The mushrikeen caught up with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and a group of the Muslims (may Allah be pleased with them) charged to his defence, of whom there were seven – and it was said that there were more – until they were all killed. The last of them was ‘Amaarah ibn Yazeed ibn as-Sakan.</p>\n<p>End quote from Jawaami‘ as-Seerah (p. 127)</p>\n<p>In that situation, what is wrong with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) seeking help and support from his companions?</p>\n<p>What is wrong with it if those who were fighting for the sake of Allah cooperated to ward off aggression and defend one another, as all fighters do, the strong helping the injured, and protecting one another?</p>\n<p>Over and above all of that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was holding firm to the rope of Allah and trusting that He would protect him; he was taking all possible measures to achieve that, which included asking his companions to help him in that, so that the call of truth would not die in its infancy and the wrongdoers and aggressors would not prevail, after having crossed desert and wilderness from Makkah to Madinah, seeking to commit aggression and wreak havoc upon the believers in their safe and secure city, and so that the disbelievers would not divert them from their religion and impose upon them the fetters of shirk and jaahiliyyah in which there is no goodness, no ethics, no truth and no true religion.</p>\n<p>This is a brief glimpse into that painful scene, and it is sufficient to explain the reason that prompted the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to honour his companions by urging them to come and defend him, by saying: “Who will repel them from us and Paradise will be his?” The impact of what had befallen him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – as it says in as-Seerah al-Halabiyyah (2/322, 324) – meant that he could not climb upon a rock in order to protect himself, until Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) helped him, and on that day he led his companions in prayer whilst seated.</p>\n<p>What we think is that what was not mentioned in any of the reports was even more serious and grievous, because war at that time would inflict serious and painful physical injuries for which there would be no treatment. If the questioner had imagined the pain that could be caused by swords and wounds and borne in mind the well-known military principle which says that fighters and their commanders are more aware of the circumstances of their battle than others, he would not have dared to blame or criticise the way in which the defence plan was drawn up on the basis of a single report taken out of context. Rather, even if he read all of history, he would never be able to truly understand what happened as the people involved themselves understood it, except only approximately. In that case he will understand that his doubt and questioning were not appropriate.</p>\n<p>With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “We have not been fair to our companions (ma ansafna as-haabana)”, that does not mean that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) endangered their lives to protect his own. Rather what is meant is a rebuke to the two men of Quraysh who did not go forward to defend him too. They should all have participated in defending and protecting him, and should not have fallen short in that important duty that should not have been carried out only by the Ansaar who went forth one after another until all seven were martyred.</p>\n<p>One of the scholars said that the more correct vowelling of this phrase is ma ansafana as-haabuna (meaning: our companions have not been fair to us), referring to those of the Sahaabah who fled and left him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to face this wounding and attempt to kill him by himself.</p>\n<p>Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said:</p>\n<p>With regard to the battle of Uhud, if we read the phrase as “ma ansafna as-haabana (we have not been fair to our companions)”, as we have vowelled it, then it refers to the Ansaar who fought in his defence and were all killed, whilst others were not. Some of the narrators of the book of Muslim vowelled it so that it reads “ma ansafana as-haabuna (our companions have not been fair to us),” which refers to those who fled and left him with only a few people. And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>End quote from Mashaariq al-Anwaar ‘ala Sihaah al-Athaar (2/16)</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This may be difficult for some people to understand, so they ask: how could he instruct them to fight and then say, We have not been fair to our companions? Was he ever anything but fair?</p>\n<p>The response to that is: people were obliged to protect the Messenger of Allah with their lives, so when he said: “Who will repel them from us?” all of them should have hastened to respond, so for some of them to lag behind was not fair.</p>\n<p>It may be that he was referring to the two Qurashi men, because they left the Ansaar to do that on their own.</p>\n<p>End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Saheehayn (3/305)</p>\n<p>Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What this means is: Quraysh have not been fair to the Ansaar, because the two Qurashis did not go out and fight; rather the Ansaar went out, one after another.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Muslim (12/147)</p>\n<p>Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If the word is read as ansafna (so what is meant is “we have not been fair”), then what is meant is when the Ansaar went out to fight one after another until they were all killed, but the two Qurashi men did not go out, he said that – meaning: Quraysh have not been fair to the Ansaar.</p>\n<p>If the word is read as ansafana (so that what is meant is “[they] have not been fair to us”), then what is meant is the companions who fled and deserted the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) so that he was left alone with a few men, and they were killed one after another. They were not fair to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and those who stood firm with him.</p>\n<p>End quote from Zaad al-Ma‘aad (3/183).</p>\n<p>There is no dispute among all people that the commander in a battle is in a unique position, unlike anyone else, and he is to be surrounded by protective measures to defend him, such as are not available to other soldiers, and that if the commander is captured or killed, it is one of the greatest blows to the army and may well be the cause of its defeat, both psychologically and militarily, so how can he be compared to others?</p>\n<p>So how about if the commander is the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), may my father and mother be sacrificed for him?</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

See the commentary of Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut et al. on <em>Sunan Ibn Majah</em>, hadith no. 2137.</p>\n<p>As-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child’s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:</p>\n<p>She does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.</p>\n<p>But if it is for another reason – meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child – and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child’s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Hashiyat as-Sawi ‘ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir</em> (2/765).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child’s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.” And he said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” This undoubtedly refers to the father’s rights, but it also includes the mother’s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child’s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan</em>.</p>\n<p>Based on the above:</p>\n<p>It is permissible for you to take from your children’s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. At the same time he should direct them towards what will benefit them, even if that affects his relationship with his wife. The aims of sharee’ah and protecting one’s religion – which is one of the most important aims of sharee’ah – take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p>Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about a man who had a Christian wife – could he let her go out to join in the Christian festivals or to go to the church?

He is the One Who spoke the Quran, the Torah and the Gospel, and other words; they are not created and separate from Him. He, may He be Glorified, speaks by His will and power, and His word is within His Essence, and is not a creation separate from Him […] The words of Allah have no end, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to mankind): ‘If the sea were ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if we brought (another sea) like it for its aid’” [Al-Kahf 18:109].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified, spoke the Quran in Arabic and the Torah in Hebrew […]&nbsp;Whoever regards His words as created must say: Is that which is created the One Who spoke to Musa: “Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship Me, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat As-Salat) for My Remembrance” [Ta-Ha 20:14]. This is impossible; these cannot be anything other than the words of the Lord of the Worlds. As Allah spoke the Quran, the Torah, and other Scriptures, with their meanings and words which consist of letters, none of that is created; rather that is the words of the Lord of the Worlds.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/37-41) (See also: Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/355-356)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Mustafa Ar-Ruhaybani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Swearing by the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, or the Quran, or a surah or verse thereof, is a (valid) oath, because it is one of His attributes. So whoever swears by it or by any part of it has sworn an oath by one of the attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same applies to swearing by the Torah or any of the other Books of Allah, may He be exalted, such as the Gospel and the Zabur. This is an oath for which expiation is required (if it is broken), because an oath sworn by the Torah or Gospel in general terms is swearing by that which was sent down from Allah, may He be Exalted, not that which has been changed or altered, and the sanctity thereof is not waived by the fact that it has been abrogated by the rulings of the Quran, as is similar to the case of some verses in the Quran the rulings of which were abrogated. That does not alter the fact that it is the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, and as it is His words, it is one of His attributes, as is the Quran.\" (Matalib Uli An-Nuha,&nbsp;6/361)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is well-known that Allah sent down Books to the Prophets.

      "answer": "<p>Belief in Allah is based on respect and veneration of Him and submission to Him.

And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.

Verily, Allah is the Oft‑Forgiving, the Most Merciful”&nbsp;[Al-Shoora 42:5]</p>\n<p>Anyone who studies the creation of Allah will see some of the signs of His greatness. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Kursiy (Footstool) and Throne: “The seven heavens, in comparison to the Footstool, are like a ring lying in the wilderness, and the superiority of the Throne to the Footstool is like the superiority of that wilderness to that ring.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (1/223).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Veneration of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, cannot co-exist in one heart with mockery of Him. Hence mocking Allah, may He be exalted, or His verses or Messengers is kufr, no matter what form it takes, whether it is in earnest or in jest. Allah says in Soorat al-Tawbah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The hypocrites fear lest a Soorah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ‘(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’</p>\n<p>65.&nbsp;If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah&nbsp;, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger&nbsp; that you were mocking?’</p>\n<p>66.&nbsp;Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals)”&nbsp;[Al-Tawbah 9:64-66]</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: This shows that mocking Allah and His verses and signs is kufr and this verse indicates that the one who belittles the Messenger of Allah in earnest or in jest is a kaafir.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Saarim al-Maslool (2/70).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said in Ahkaam al-Quran commenting on this verse: What they – the hypocrites – said must have been either in earnest or in jest, but no matter what it was, it is kufr, because joking about kufr is also kufr, and there is no difference of opinion concerning this among the ummah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-Sa’di said: Mocking Allah and His Messenger is kufr which puts one beyond the pale of Islam, because the religion is based on veneration of Allah and of His religion and His Messengers, and mocking any of that is contrary to this principle and is diametrically opposed to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What this man said, in which he showed disrespect towards Allah – exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say – and spoke as if he regarded Allah as equal in status to a human being and thought that he could address Him as such, is kufr, as anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the religion of Allah would realize, and no one would do that but one who is extremely ignorant or a man whose heart has no knowledge of Allah and no respect for Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then he added to his mockery and said “I must tell Allah.” Does Allah, may He be exalted, need to be told anything by an ignorant wrongdoer?!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven”&nbsp;[Aal ‘Imraan 3:5]</p>\n<p>This wretch has to renew his faith and enter Islam again, and repent to Allah from this blatant kufr.

Stars of David (Jewish stars) or crosses, or any other symbols that are connected to the Jews and Christians?</div>\n<div>6. Gold rings that are designed specifically for men, which the shopkeepers say that they will not sell to Muslims?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly: it is not permissible to engrave aayaat from the Qur’aan or the Name of Allah on metals or stone, because this is not the purpose for which these aayaat were revealed, and because there is the fear that this would expose these aayaat and the Name of Allah to disrespect. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: using these signs of the zodiac is an idea that comes from jaahiliyyah and the Muslim is obliged to steer clear of this and of everything that could lead to a revival of these jaahili ideas. This is in addition to the fact that they involve pictures of animate beings. On this basis it is not permissible to make or collect jewellery that bears these images, or to pray wearing such items.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly and fourthly: the ahaadeeth which forbid images of animate beings are general in meaning and include all images which are called images of living beings. This also includes images of the head, so on this basis it is not permissible to make these pieces.</p>\n<p>Selling and buying pictures of animate beings is not permitted, because it was reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“Allah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and idols.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 3/43; Muslim, 3/1207).</p>\n<p>This prohibition exists also because it may lead to exaggerated ideas about those who are represented in the pictures, as happened in the case of the people of Nooh. In Saheeh al-Imaam al-Bukhaari, it is reported that concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwaa‘, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya‘ooq nor Nasr’” [Nooh 71:23], Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “These were the names of righteous people among the people of Nooh. When they died, the Shaytaan inspired their people to set up stone altars in the places where they used to sit, and these were named after them. So they did this, but they did not worship them. But when that generation died and knowledge was lost, the worship of these people began.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6/73). And there are many other texts which also forbid making and using images of living beings.</p>\n<p>This applies to anything that is in the form of an animate creature. With regard to items on which there are pictures of animate beings, whether those items are made of gold, silver, paper, fabric or are tools, if they are circulated among people in order to be hung on walls etc. in a manner which is not considered disrespectful, then it is haraam to deal in them, because of the comprehensive nature of the evidence which states that making images is haraam. But if the item on which there is an image is to be used in a manner that implies disrespect, such as a tool used for cutting, a carpet that will be stepped on, a pillow that will be slept on, etc., then this is permissible, because of the report narrated in al-Saheehayn from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which she said that she hung up a curtain on which there were images, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tore it down. She said: I cut it up and made two pillows out of it, and he used to recline upon them. According to a version narrated by Ahmad: I cut it up and made two cushions out of it, and I saw him reclining on one of them and there was an image on it. (al-Bukhaari,6/103, 214, 247; Muslim,3/1168-1169, no. 2107). We should note that making images of animate beings is haraam and such images should not be used in crafts, on clothing or in anything else, because of the evidence referred to above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifthly: it is not permissible to make jewellery that bears the symbols of kufr, such as crosses and stars of David. It is not permissible to buy or sell such items.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sixthly: it is not permissible to sell gold rings which are made specifically for men if they are going to wear them. The shopkeepers’ comments that they will not sell them to Muslims is no excuse, because they are in a Muslim country, and whoever lives in a Muslim country should not deal in anything except that which has been permitted by the pure sharee’ah of Islam. This argument is like the argument of the one who sells alcohol and says that he will only sell it to the kuffaar, because gold rings are haraam for men.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I am afraid of the rebellious jinn and the devils, and I am afraid of the dark. Every time there is any talk about the jinn, my heart almost leaves my chest and I go into a severe panic, especially</p>\n<p>at night. This fear is so severe that it prevents me from praying qiyam al-layl and praying Fajr in congregation. How can I rid myself of this fear?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What you must do is gain courage by remembering Allah and always obeying Him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured} [ar-Ra‘d 13:28].</p>\n<p>So fortify yourself with remembrance of Allah, especially the adhkar that are to be recited morning and evening, and the adhkar that are to be recited when going to sleep and when entering the bathroom. And recite Surat al-Baqarah often in your house, for the Shaytan flees from the house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.</p>\n<p>You should understand that the scheme of the Shaytan is weak, and he is much more insignificant than you think. In fact, Allah has limited his scheming to whispers (waswasah), so when you are afraid of something, seek help against it by remembering Allah and turning to Him, for He is the best protector.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There is no one who says every morning and every evening ‘<em>Bismillah illadhi la yadurru ma‘a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa la fi’s-sama’ wa huwa as-sami‘ al-‘alim</em> (In the Name of Allah, with whose name nothing on earth or in heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)’ three times, but nothing will harm him.”</p>\n<p>It is a sahih hadith which was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3388), who said: A sahih hasah hadith; it was also classed as sahih by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Khawlah bint Hakeem as-Sulamiyyah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever makes a stop on a journey and says, ‘<em>A‘udhu bi kalimat Allah il-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</em> (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.”&nbsp;Narrated by Muslim, 2708 and others.</p>\n<p>A man asked ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khanbash: What did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do when the devils schemed against him?</p>\n<p>Jibril (peace be upon him) taught the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the devils and the rebellious jinn by saying:</p>\n<p><em>A‘udhu bi kalimat illah it-tammat illatī la yujawizuhunna barrun wa la fajirun min sharri ma khalaq, wa dhara'a wa bara'a, wa min sharri ma yanzilu min as-sama', wa min sharri ma ya‘ruju fīha, wa min sharri ma dhara'a fi’l-arḍ, wa min sharri ma yakhruju minha, wa min sharri fitan il-layli wa’n-nahar, wa min sharri kulli tariqin illa tariqan yatruqu bikhayrin ya Rahman</em> (I seek refuge in the Perfect Words of Allah, which neither the righteous nor the evil may overcome, from the evil of what He created, of what He scattered and what He made, from the evil of what descends from the heavens, and of what ascends to them, from the evil of what He scattered in the earth, and of what emerges from it, from the evil trials of night and day, and from the evil of every night visitor, except the night visitor who comes with good, O Merciful Gracious).</p>\n<p>A sahih hadith, narrated by Ahmad (15035) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>It was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Khubayb that his father said: I was with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the road to Makkah, and I had the opportunity to be alone with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). I draw close to him and he said: “Speak.”</p>\n<p>I said: What should I say?</p>\n<p>He said: “Speak.”</p>\n<p>I said: What should I say?</p>\n<p>He said: “Say: {Qul a‘udhu bi rabbi l falaq (Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak)} until you complete the surah, then say {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb in-nas (Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind)} until you complete the surah.” Then he said: “The people will not seek refuge with Allah with anything better than these two.”</p>\n<p>A sahih hadith, narrated by an-Nasa’i (5429) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>You should be careful lest the Shaytan prevent you from doing acts of worship or praying in congregation by scaring you and making you afraid. For all that he wants is to prevent you from praying in congregation, then Allah knows best what else he could lead you to of evil or prevent you from doing of good after that.</p>\n<p>May Allah make you steadfast, give you courage, reassure you and avert from you the schemes, temptations and whispers of the Shaytan.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>The father of one of my friends has died and it was necessary to attend the dinner that they offered to the people present. Whilst we were waiting for the food to be served, some of the people present began to recite Qur’aan together, and I am aware that this is an innovation and that it is not proven from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and his family). <br />\n<br />\nI wanted to object to this action but I was afraid of causing trouble and I did not have sufficient evidence.<br />\n<br />\nWas I sinning by being present and listening to their recitation? <br />\n<br />\nShould I have objected to them, even if that was by saying that there is no proof of this from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?.</p>\n",

      "title": "Her brother cheated her and bought her share for a very low price, and is refusing to give her anything on the grounds that she agreed to the sale",
      "question": "<p>My father died and left behind a tannery; my brother took over running it and he was paying us rent. Two months ago, I asked him to buy my share, because I needed the money. I did not know the value of my share, and I did not ask anyone, because I trusted my brother. So he bought it for 60,000 pounds. Two weeks later, he bought from the rest of my sisters their shares in the tannery, paying each one 160,000 pounds, i.e., more than double (what he had paid me). I found out that the government estimated it at a higher price, because the business is going to be moved, and he knew and my sisters all knew, except me. Now he has cheated me, because he knew the real price, but when I asked him to give me the rest of the money, he said to me: You sold it and you agreed (to that price), and I bought it. Do I really have no right to ask for the rest of my dues like my sisters? Or will he bear a burden of sin, and is he obliged to give me the rest of what is due to me, because he deceived me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If someone sells something to another person who is unaware of its real price and did not bargain about the price, trusting the purchaser to be honest, then finds out that he was cheated, he has the choice to annul the deal.</p>\n<p>He has the right to ask the purchaser for the rest of the price, and if the purchaser refuses, then the seller has the right to cancel the deal, take back the items sold, and give back to the purchaser the price that he paid.</p>\n<p>The fuqahaa’ differed with regard to the percentage of the price that is regarded as cheating – whether it is one third or one fifth or what is regarded by traders as being unfair and cheating – but if your brother bought from your sisters their shares, which were the same as your share, for 160,000, and this was the market price, then what happened to you is cheating and is unfair according to scholarly consensus.</p>\n<p>It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (7/435) regarding one who has the right to cancel a deal that is regarded as unfair and cheating: … the third case is one who entered into a transaction on the basis of trust. What is meant here is one who was unaware of the real value, whether he was a seller or a purchaser, and is not good at bargaining. He has the option of annulling the deal if he was cheated of the percentage mentioned above, i.e., by a percentage that is out of the ordinary, because that unfair deal took place because of his ignorance (of the real value). Therefore he has the right to annul the deal.</p>\n<p>But in the case of one who has experience and is aware of the price of the item sold, but enters into a transaction knowing that the price is unfair, and one who accepts an unfair price because he was in a hurry to sell, and if he had paused to think and had not rushed, that unfair transaction would not have taken place – in these cases they do not have the right to annul the deal, because there was no cheating or deceit in this case. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone buys an item for 2500 riyals, when it is only worth 1500 riyals, if the seller knew that the price was 1500 riyals, but he knew that this man was a stranger who did not know prices, and he sold it to him for 2500, then he is sinning and it is not permissible for him to do that; if the buyer finds out, then he has the right to annul the deal, and this is described as an annulment due to an unfair deal, because 1000 out of 2500 is a lot. But if it was slightly unfair, such as a 10% difference, then that does not matter, because people commonly do deals that involve slight overcharging or undercharging.</p>\n<p>But if the seller does not know – for example, if the price is 2500 but prices have fallen, and the seller is unaware of the fall in prices, then the seller is not sinning, but the purchaser still has the right to annul the deal, because he has been subject to an unfair deal.</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqaa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (56/14).</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: if someone were to ask: is it possible for the seller to enter into an unfair deal and be cheated?</p>\n<p>The answer is: Yes, this happened a great deal, especially in earlier times. For example, a trader might know that sugar was rising in price, so he would go to people who had sugar and buy all that they had at the current price, when they did not know that its value had risen. This is undoubtedly unfair and is cheating, and the sellers were not being negligent when they sold it at that price, because when they sold it they thought that that was the correct value and that the prices were stable.</p>\n<p>To sum up: just as the purchaser has the right to cancel the deal if he finds out that he got into an unfair deal, the seller also has the right, if he finds that he got into an unfair deal, to cancel the deal. There is no difference in that regard.</p>\n<p>End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (8/303).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The right to cancel an unfair deal gives the one who finds that he has been cheated the choice between annulling the deal or going ahead with the deal without any compensation.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars said: he has the right to choose between cancelling the deal or going ahead with the deal with compensation, which is to make up for the difference in price.</p>\n<p>According to the first view, you have the right to cancel the deal, then to sell your share for the price that you want.</p>\n<p>According to the second view, you have the right to go ahead with the deal and to be given the difference, which is 100,000.</p>\n<p>It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (3/212):</p>\n<p>The purchaser has a choice between returning the goods or keeping them.</p>\n<p>Ibn Rajab said in Sharh al-Arba‘een an-Nawawiyyah: The price should be reduced for the purchaser to a level that is fair, if he has been cheated, and the extra amount should be returned to him if he has already&nbsp; paid it.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “If one of you says, when he has intercourse with his wife: ‘Bismillaah, Allaahumma jannibni al-Shaytaana wa jannib al-Shaytaana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allaah, O Allaah, keep the Shaytaan away from me and keep the Shaytaan away from that which You bestow upon us),’ if it is decreed that they should have a child, the Shaytaan will never harm him.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5165; Muslim, 1434.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to how this benefits the child, the scholars differed as to what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “the Shaytaan will never harm him.” There are many opinions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That what it means is that the Shaytaan will not control him because of the blessing of saying Bismillaah, rather he will be one of the people of whom it was said: “Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves” [al-Hijr 15:42].</p>\n<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that he will never harm him physically.</p>\n<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that this is a means of his being protected from shirk and kufr.</p>\n<p>4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that he will keep away from major sins.</p>\n<p>5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was said that he will not be harmed by the Shaytaan’s participation in his father’s having intercourse with his mother, as it was narrated that Mujaahid said: The one who has intercourse and does not say Bismillaah, the Shaytaan wraps himself around his penis and has intercourse along with him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar said: Perhaps this is the most correct answer. But the first answer may also be correct, especially since we know that many people who know about the great blessing of saying Bismillaah may forget all about it at the time of intercourse, and for the few who may remember it and say it, pregnancy may not occur. If this is very rare, then it is possible that the first answer may be correct.</p>\n",

And Al-Hasan did not hear from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). This was the view of Ayyub, Yunus ibn ‘Ubayd and ‘Ali ibn Zayd.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus the Hadith has two faults:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abu Al-Miqdam Hisham ibn Ziyad (may Allah have mercy on him): the scholars of Hadith unanimously agreed that he is to be regarded as da‘eef. Ibn Hibban said: He narrates fabricated reports from trustworthy narrators, and it is not permissible to quote him as evidence. (See: Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, 11/39)</li>\n<li>There is a break in the chain of narrators between Al-Hasan and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence it was classed as inauthentic by Ibn Al-Jawzi in Al-Mawdu`at (1/247), Ibn Al-‘Arabi in ‘Aridah Al-Ahwadhi, 6/35, and Al-Albani in Da`if At-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"2\">In his Tafsir (exegesis) (4/46), Al-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated a Hadith from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) that is similar to the Hadith quoted above, except that its chain of narrators includes Sallam ibn Salim who is accused of lying. Hence, As-Shaykh Al-Albani, in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (no. 4632), ruled that it is very inauthentic.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ahmad ibn Mani` also narrated it from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) in his Musnad, as it says in Al-Busayri’s Ithaf Al-Khiyarah Al-Maharah (6/89).

With regard to Fidal ibn Jubayr, Ibn Hibban said: It is not permissible to quote him as evidence under any circumstances; he narrated Hadiths that have no basis. Because of him, Al-Haythami regarded it as a faulty Hadith and said (2/168): It was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Kabeer and its isnad includes Fidal ibn Jubayr, who is very inauthentic, and Hafs ibn ‘Umar Al-Mazini, who is not known, as it says in Al-Lisan.” (Silsilah Al-AHadith Ad-Da`ifah wa Al-Mawdu`ah, 11/191, no. 5112)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Hadith is also classed as inauthentic in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Daimah, 3/141.</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/6653\" target=\"_blank\">6653</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7699\" target=\"_blank\">7699</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9211\" target=\"_blank\">9211</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13692\" target=\"_blank\">13692</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

But if he leaves Mina, for example to do     tawaaf al-ifaadah at the beginning of the night, then he is not able to go     back before dawn because of the crowds, there is no sin on him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is obligatory     to look for a place in Mina before he decides to stay in Muzdalifah. If he     cannot find a place (in Mina) then he may go to Muzdalifah and stay there.     He does not have to go to Mina and spend most of the night driving around,     or looking for a spot on the roadside among the vehicles, because that may     put him in danger. We say: If you cannot find a place in Mina, then stay in     Muzdalifah, where the tents end, and you do not have to do anything so long     as you looked for a place but did not find any, because Allaah does not     burden any soul beyond its scope. End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn     ‘Uthaymeen (23/240, 241).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If the     pilgrim tries hard to look for a place in Mina to spend the night there, but     he does not find any, there is no sin on him if he stays outside of it, and     he does not have to offer any fidyah, because of the general meaning of the     words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you     can”</p>\n<p>    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]</p>\n<p>    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) said: “If I enjoin you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.”     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (16/149).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, he must register with a group that will spend     the night in Mina, or he may register with a group that will spend the night     in Muzdalifah, but he should have the intention of looking for a place in     Mina. If he finds a place he must stay there for half the night, but if he     does not find a place there is no sin on him if he stays in Muzdalifah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it valid to retract a vow?",
      "question": "<p>I am a student and I asked Allah to let me get first place in my class, and I vowed that if I achieved that, I would fast on a specific day, which is Thursday. Before I started the second half of the year, before the results were known, I found out that the school would announce who was first in the school, not in each class, so I retracted my vow. Now I would fast on the same Thursday if I got first place in the school, not in the class. <br />\nThe results came out and I got second place in the school, and first place in the class. Hence I did not fast on that day, because I did not get first place in the school.  <br />\nAm I sinning in this case? What should I do?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Your vow that if you got first place in your class, you would fast that Thursday, is an act of worship that must be fulfilled when the condition for it is met. As you came first in your class, you have to fast for a day as you vowed to do, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to obey Allah, let him obey Him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6318).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not acceptable to retract a vow, because of what we have stated above about it being obligatory to fulfil it, and because ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Four things are binding in every case: manumission, divorce, marriage, and vows.” Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf (4/82). And it was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “There are four that cannot be retracted and must be fulfilled: marriage, divorce, manumission and vows.” This was quoted by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (8/197).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (7/267).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your second vow has to do with the placing in the school; you do not have to do anything because the condition was not fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, if you vowed that you would fast on any Thursday, then you must fulfil the vow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you vowed that you would fast a specific Thursday and it has passed, then you have to make up this day and fast on another Thursday, and you also have to offer expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen), because you did not fast on the day that you specified for fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (28/212):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he vowed to fast a certain month and he did not fast it with no excuse, then he has to make it up and also offer expiation for breaking an oath – and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point. If he did not fast it due to an excuse, then he has to make it up – and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point – but there are two opinions narrated from Imam Ahmad with regard to expiation. Our view is that he also has to offer expiation, and this was regarded as the correct opinion by Ibn Qudaamah and others. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should note that making vows is makrooh, although it is obligatory to fulfil them, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6608) and Muslim (1639) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told people not to make vows and said: “They do not avert anything, all they do is get something out of a stingy person.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Give us explanation of rafayadain in the prayer.</div>\n<div>Is It permissible or not.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands for takbeerat al-ihram (the takbeer at the beginning of the prayer), sometimes whilst saying the takbeer, sometimes after it and sometimes before. (al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i)</p>\n<p>When he had finished reciting Quran, he would pause for a moment then raise his hands, say takbeer and do rukoo’.</p>\n<p>(Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 128).</p>\n<p>He used to raise his hands when he stood up from rukoo’</p>\n<p>(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and this raising of the hands is mutawaatir (reported by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). It is the opinion of the majority of scholars and of some of the Hanafis. (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by al-Albaani, p. 136).</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say takbeer when he got up for the third rak’ah</p>\n<p>(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and he would raise his hands sometimes when he said this takbeer. (al-Bukhaari and Abu Dawood). (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 177).</p>\n<p>Raising the hands in prayer was a well-known practice among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Imaam al-Bukhaari said: “Al-Hasan and Humayd ibn Hilaal said: ‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all used to raise their hands, without exception.”</p>\n<p>(Juz’ raf’ al-yadayn, p. 26, ma’a jila’ al-‘aynayn).</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Look at the practice at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Sahaabah after him. They used to raise their hands in prayer when doing rukoo’, and when standing up again. And in the time of the Sahaabah, if ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar saw someone not raising his hands in prayer, he would throw a stone at him. [next phrase is unclear].</p>\n<p>(I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/376).</p>\n<p>So what is proven in the Sunnah with regard to raising the hands in prayer is that they should be raised at four points in the prayer: when pronouncing takbeerat al-ihram, when doing rukoo’, when standing up from rukoo’, and after standing up from the first tashahhud.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He owes money and wants to pay it off with haraam wealth",
      "question": "<p>I am a mother of four sons, spending on their maintenance. Three years ago, I lent someone a large amount of money, giving him some money every now and then, on the basis that he would return the money one year later. Three years have gone by, and I have asked him to pay me back any sum of money, even in monthly instalments. Now he is saying to me that he does not have anything left over of his salary from the company, because of his responsibilities and commitments, but if I want haraam wealth, then he can pay me back the money that I lent him within one month, but it will be from haraam wealth; I will be accountable for this haraam wealth before Allah, may He be exalted, and he will have discharged his obligation before Allah, may He be exalted, and will be free of the sin of this haraam wealth. Should I take back my money from him and accept this haraam wealth, because I have been waiting for three years and he has not paid me back my money, even by monthly instalments?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Haraam wealth is of two types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is haraam in and of itself, which is wealth that is taken without consent, such as wealth that is stolen, seized by force or plundered. This is haraam to the one who takes it, and to the one to whom it is passed on, if the latter is aware of the situation, because the prohibition concerning it has to do with the wealth itself, because it is the property of the one who was wronged and must be returned to him. As for making use of it and benefiting from it, that is sharing in the wrongdoing and sin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if the wealth is haraam in and of itself, it is not permissible for him to pay off the debt with it, and it is not permissible for you to accept it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is haraam because of the manner in which it was acquired. This is wealth that is taken with consent in return for a haraam action, or by means of a haraam business deal, such as the fee of a singer or musician, or money resulting from riba-based transactions, such as bribes and interest, money paid for alcohol or drugs, and the like.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This wealth is haraam only for the one who acquires it, according to some scholars, and it is not haraam for the one to whom it is passed on by permissible means, such as a gift or maintenance.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/289442\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">289442</a>.</p>\n<p>If the one who acquired this wealth has repented, and is in need, it is permissible for him to take from it as much as he needs, and it is permissible for him to pay off his debt with it.</p>\n<p>Based on that, if the debtor does not own anything except this haraam wealth, there is nothing wrong with him paying off his debt with it, and there is no blame on you for accepting that.</p>\n<p>What appears to be the case from the question is that he does not currently possess this haraam wealth; rather he wants to commit sin in order to pay off his debts. If that is the case, according to what we understand, then it is not permissible for him to do that, and it is not permissible for you to call on him to do that. Rather you must give him more time, if he is indeed in financial difficulty, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease” [al-Baqarah 2:280].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One of the things we learn from this verse is that it is obligatory to give one who is in difficulty more time, until he becomes well-off, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: “then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease.” So it is not permissible to demand that he pay off the debt or to ask him for what is owed.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah (3/391).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My problem is with my father i have 7 brothers and i am number 5 and i asked my father that i want to marry and his answer was no wait 4 years and i am going to finish my trainnig in shallah after 1 year and maybe you know how is my country it is really not good ALLAH AL MODTA3AAN so i want to know is my father going to have thnoooob coz he didn't let me marry and my all brothers are singles not marry and i cant talk to him any more coz when i talk to him he gets angry and i cant say anything that time and really i didn't do any thing bad  wallah i want to do everything in the right way but he don't allow me to do it</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We noticed in your question that you are kind to your father,     and this is something to be commended. We urge you to keep honouring your     father, for Allaah has enjoined that upon you, and the texts which enjoin     that are so well known that we do not need to quote them here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We also noticed from your question how hard you are trying     not to fall into doing something that would lead to doom and punishment.     This indicates – in sha Allaah – that your religious commitment is strong.     Your religious commitment is your capital, so beware of squandering it and     losing out in this world and in the Hereafter. Keep this fear of falling     into immoral actions which would earn you the wrath of Allaah. Always     remember that Allaah is watching you, night and day, and remember that He     knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden; He knows the fraud of     the eyes, and all that the hearts conceal. It is sufficient to imagine if     Allaah were to take your soul whilst you – Allaah forbid – were committing a     sin: how would you meet Allaah?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;We advise you to fear Allaah, for that will form a barrier     between you and immoral actions. We advise you to lower you gaze and avoid     looking at anything that Allaah has forbidden. You are only allowed the     first glance which happens unintentionally. We advise you not to listen to     things that Allaah has forbidden that may provoke desire, and to keep away     from bad company and immoral friends who do not want anything for you except     Hell in the Hereafter and shame in this world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    These are some of the things that make a person fall into     immoral actions. The more you keep away from them, the more you will keep     away from immorality. After that, we advise you to do acts of worship,     especially fasting, which is the remedy recommended by the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in cases such as yours. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with     him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do     so, and whoever cannot, then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.”</p>\n<p>    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4778; Muslim, 1400)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We advise you to read Qur’aan and to make a lot of du’aa’,     asking Allaah to keep you away from temptations both obvious and hidden. We     advise you to find good friends who can guide you to the path of     righteousness and help you to adhere to it. We also advise you to exercise,     and to go to sleep early.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some of the means which, hopefully, will be the     means of keeping you away from everything that is not pleasing to your     Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We offer you the following useful advice:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Muflih said – quoting from Ibn ‘Aqeel in al-Funoon     – You listen to the words “Tell the believing men     to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things)” [al-Noor 24:30 –     interpretation of the meaning], but you are     staring at that which Allaah has forbidden as if you are desperate to     acquire it or regretting that you have no way to get it. And you listen to     the words, “Some faces that Day shall be Naadirah (shining and radiant)”     [al-Qiyaamah 75:22 – interpretation of the meaning] and you think that     they were revealed concerning you. And you listen to the words “And some     faces that Day will be Baasirah (dark, gloomy, frowning and sad)”     [al-Qiyaamah 75:24 – interpretation of the meaning], and you think that     they were revealed concerning someone else! How can you be so sure? Where     did this wishful thinking come from? This is a kind of deception which     stands between you and taqwa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/151, 152)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to what your father is doing, preventing you from     getting married and delaying your marriage, this is a mistake on his part.     He should fear Allaah with regard to his sons, and hasten to arrange their     marriages. He should realize that the need of some of his sons and daughters     for marriage may be greater than their need for food and drink.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There follows a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah     have mercy on him) on a case that was similar to your father’s:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “As Allaah has enjoined upon your father to spend on your     food, drink, clothing and accommodation, he must also arrange your marriage     if you need to get married, as the scholars have said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I would like to take this opportunity to point out something     important, which is that some fathers, even though they are well-off, refuse     to arrange their sons’ marriages when the sons ask them to, telling them,     ‘Earn enough money to spend on yourself and get married, for you are a man,’     and so on. But the scholars have stated that whoever is obliged to spend on     a person is also obliged to keep him chaste and arrange his marriage. So let     these fathers fear Allaah and do that which Allaah has enjoined upon them,     namely keeping their sons chaste. And Allaah is the Source of strength.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From Fataawa Manaar al-Islam, part 3, p. 619&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Finally, we ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast and     chaste, and to help us, for He is the Best of supporters and helpers.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>When does the pilgrim exit ihram?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly: the actions of the Day of Sacrifice are three for the pilgrim who is doing Ifraad. They are: stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, shaving the head or cutting the hair, and tawaf al-ifaadah, plus Sa`i if he&nbsp; did not do it after the tawaf of arrival. For those who are doing Tamattu’ or Qiraan, they must also slaughter the sacrifice. The one who is doing tamattu’ must also do Sa`i after tawaf al-ifaadah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: these actions should be done in the following order: stoning the Jamrah, then offering the sacrifice, then shaving the head or cutting the hair, then tawaf and Sa`i. This is best, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he stoned the Jamrah, then offered the sacrifice, then shaved his head, then ‘Aa’ishah put perfume on him, then he went to the Ka’bah (to do tawaf al-ifaadah). He was asked about the order in which these actions were to be done, by those who had done some of them ahead of others, and he said: “It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly: Whoever does two of them apart from offering the sacrifice has thus completed the first stage of exiting ihram, hence it becomes permissible for him to do all the things that were forbidden to him whilst in ihram, apart&nbsp; from intercourse. When he has done all three, then everything that was forbidden to him become permissible, including intercourse. There are many ahaadeeth concerning this which point to this meaning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the Source of strength.

      "title": "Parents Differing on How to Raise Children",
      "question": "<p>If the parents disagree about the way to raise the children, and neither of them thinks the way the other does, does the wife have to obey her husband in that which she thinks will lead to fitnah for the son – as his father wants to call him to account for everything great or small – or can she pretend to be obeying him in front of him, then do what she thinks is appropriate with her son after that, in accordance with the words of Allah “Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)” [al-Tahreem 66:6] and the hadeeth “Each of you is a shepherd”? Or is this advice addressed only to the wali (guardian), who is the father? Or is this included in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator”? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Raising children is a responsibility that is shared by both parents. This is a trust which Allah enjoins them to take care of, each according to his position and ability, and this great responsibility cannot be restricted to one of them and not the other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Think about how the hadeeth refers to the responsibility of each parent, so as to reinforce the idea that each of them is individually responsible in this regard. And in the hadeeth about the fitrah pure state one is born in) we see how children take their religion from both parents, and not just one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (pure state of Islam), then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1292) and Muslim (2658).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to fulfilment of shared duties, Islam enjoins a means by which they are usually fulfilled in the best and most successful manner, which is by means of discussion and consultation. This may be the most important cause of family happiness and successful rearing of children. The command to consult one another regarding shared responsibilities is mentioned in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:233]</p>\n<p>Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., if the parents of the child agree to wean him before he is two years old, and they think that this is good for him, and they consult one another about that and agree on it, then there is no sin on them for that. It may be understood from this that if one of them makes this decision on his or her own that is not sufficient and it is not permissible for one of them to decide that without consulting the other. This was stated by al-Thawri and others. This is safer for the child and ensures that his interests will be looked after. This is by the mercy of Allah towards His slaves, as He has set out guidelines for the parents in raising their child, and has enjoined that which is in their best interests and the child’s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer al-Qur’aan il-‘Azeem (1/380).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some studies indicate that many marital problems that lead to divorce are caused by the absence of this matter in the marriage, namely consultation in family life, or by some error in implementing it. Discussion and consultation are an art and a science which must be practised and exercised and understood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is natural that the parents’ opinions with regard to some shared responsibilities, such as raising the children, will sometimes differ, and that is due to differences in the background of the parents, or because of interference by some relatives, or other reasons. But this should not lead to a crisis unless the parents fail to reach an appropriate way of dealing with this difference of opinion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a solution that may be suggested to resolve the difference in the parents’ methods of child-rearing, which is consulting a specialist or someone whom they may easily consult about the problems concerning which they differ, who has experience and can be trusted. Raising children is an art and a science in itself on which studies are done and for which certificates are awarded. Indeed it is one of the most important and precise of specialities. The parents will always be able find some trustworthy specialists in child-rearing, so they should consult them and ask their opinions concerning the specific point of conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps if the parents understand the serious repercussions that difference in opinion on child-rearing will have on the son’s personality, that will make them realize that it is essential to overcome this problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The message that the father wants to convey may be lost and its effects may be weakened if the mother gives a different message, and that may lead to the son choosing the message that suits him, and in many case he will come up with a third solution, based on his own whims and desires. This means that it will be difficult for the son to distinguish between right and wrong, halaal (lawful)and haraam haram (unlawful), , and this is the greatest threat to a sound upbringing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Differences with regard to child-rearing may lead to the child hating one of his parents and may lead to greater and greater problems at later stages, based on the depth of the differences between the father and the mother with regard to raising the children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So it is essential to have agreement between the father and mother from the outset that neither of them will send a different message to the children than the other, especially in front of them. If there is any comment or disagreement to be voiced, then it should be delayed until they can discuss it away from where the children can hear them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also very important for the parents to interact with one another honestly and sincerely. It is not appropriate, according to sharee’ah (Islamic law), common sense, education or manners, for one of the parents to pretend to the other that he or she agrees with a specific point of child-rearing, when in fact he or she thinks otherwise and does not do that. The other party will soon discover the deception and there will be a loss of trust between the parents with regard to raising the children, which will only lead to further problems, whereas being honest, consulting one another and coming to mutual agreements will lead to overcoming this difference of opinion and will help the parents to overcome other differences too, when they get used to consulting one another and working things out together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also essential to remember that Allah is always watching how we raise our children, and to refer to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions and teachings) of His Messenger with regard to principles of child-rearing in the event of any difference of opinion. If the difference has to do with methods, then the way to solve it is by consulting one another and discussing the matter, after which the one to decide between them is a sincere and trustworthy adviser who is a specialist or who has experience. If the parents are sincere in their intention to teach the child the proper attitude and religion, then Allah will grant them a way out from their differences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, it must be noted that Allah has created in women that which He has not created in man. Emotion and compassion are stronger in women than in men, and reason, willpower and management are stronger in men than in women. Attention should be paid to this fact when there are differences of opinion between the spouses, and perhaps if the matter is delegated to the husband that will be very beneficial, if the husband is religiously-committed and wise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Hello and thank you for receiving my question. As a female looking to marry a Muslim guy, I consider myself Natural and organic ideologically. At this point I've Recognized that there is one god, That controls everything And is The Guardian and creator of everything in existence. As far as other things , That religions preach, (Mostly the monotheistic religions) about prophets angels, etc, I'm not disagreeing or agreeing with it at the moment. But I do know that there is one God only.</p>\n<p> With that being said I know some things about Islam where The Muslim man can marry a Christian or Jew female, BECAUSE THEY ARE 'MONOTHEISTIC' Compared to the other religions.</p>\n<p> So my question is if I'm monotheistic just like the Christian and Jewish woman is, Then I should be able to marry this Muslim man. IF YOUR GOING TO SAY NO, because they're people of the book, what's the difference between me if i don't believe/ recognize the prophets yet, and a Christian women who believes in some prophets and not in others like prophet Muhammad. So why the double standards,(if you say no).</p>\n<p> Thank you again for taking time to read this question and please take into consideration that there isnt any other detailed (muslim/ non muslim marriage) question like this on your website so please take time and thought in answering it. Because as simple as your religion is I'm pretty much at the basic similar level with you, that would consider me to be monotheistic although not Muslim</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If you really believe in the one God and Creator, then what is your excuse for not believing in His Messengers?</p>\n<p>How can you be a believer in God when you do not worship Him according to any religion?</p>\n<p>Do you think that believing is a merely theoretical matter that does not require any deeds or obligations?</p>\n<p>Belief in God has two aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>believing in His Oneness and perfection;</li>\n<li>and worshipping Him, seeking to draw near to Him, obeying Him and complying with His commands. That includes believing in His Books and His Messengers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So long as God has blessed you with insight and understanding, what is keeping you from becoming Muslim?</p>\n<p>Entering Islam and hastening to do so, without wasting a single moment, is more appropriate and more important than simply thinking about the issue of marriage or asking about it.</p>\n<p>Not one of us can guarantee that he will live a moment longer, but if he enters the true religion, he will attain the means of eternal happiness and will save himself from the fire.</p>\n<p>We invite you to do that and advise you to do it, so hasten and do not delay.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Islam is based on being a true slave or servant of God, for the servant can only hear and obey the command of his lord and master.</p>\n<p>Whoever believes in God accepts His rulings, submits and surrenders to them, and strives to put them into practice as much as he can.</p>\n<p>One of these rulings is the prohibition on marrying a woman who is not a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian).</p>\n<p>This ruling is definitive in the religion of Islam, and there is no room for debate concerning it.</p>\n<p>God, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him”</p>\n<p>[al-Qasas 28:68]</p>\n<p>“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:36].</p>\n<p>If a monotheistic Muslim woman believes in God and all His Prophets and Messengers, but she disbelieves in one verse of the Book of God [the Qur’an], may He be exalted, or rejects something that is well known to be part of the religion, then she goes beyond the pale of Islam by doing that, and it is forbidden for a Muslim man to marry her.</p>\n<p>It is not only the matter of whether a woman is a monotheist or not. If that were the case, it would not be permissible to marry a Christian woman, because in fact she is a polytheist, not a monotheist.</p>\n<p>Rather it is the matter of what God has permitted and what He has forbidden, for He is the one who has the power to command and forbid. He has permitted marriage to a Muslim woman and a kitaabi [i.e., Jewish or Christian] woman, and He has not permitted marriage to any other women, so the individual has no option but to accept that and submit to it.</p>\n<p>If a person does not understand this principle on which Islam – and all other religions – is based, namely compliance and obedience, then his monotheism or affirmation of God’s oneness will never be sound, and no good deed will ever be accepted from him, no matter how much he claims to be a believer or a monotheist.</p>\n<p>God, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisaa’ 4:65].</p>\n<p>This does not mean that we cannot understand the wisdom behind many teachings; rather we understand a great deal of that, but we believe and we submit, even if it so happens that we do not understand the wisdom behind a particular teaching.</p>\n<p>It may be noted here that God, the All-Knowing and All-Aware, knows that the kitaabi [i.e., Jewish or Christian] woman who believes in God, and believes in His messages in general terms, and believes in the resurrection is, as a result of that, close to Islam, and marrying her will, in most cases, call her and her family to Islam, and encourage her to enter Islam, in contrast to a woman who does not believe in God, or in the Prophets, or in the resurrection.</p>\n<p>This may be the wisdom behind it, or it may be that we have not got it right in what we have said about the reason behind this teaching.</p>\n<p>But whatever the case, we believe that Allah does not prescribe anything except for a wise purpose, and we do not make following any of His rulings dependent upon knowing the wisdom behind it; rather we comply and submit, and we trust that He, may He be glorified, is the All-Knowing, the Most Wise, the All-Aware.</p>\n<p>So you should examine the matter in this light, on the basis of the following straightforward approach:</p>\n<p>If there is one God and Creator, then it is He Who has the power to command and prohibit, and He is most merciful and most kind; He sent the Messengers and revealed the Books to guide thereby whoever wants to be His slave and servant.</p>\n<p>The one who attains the honour of this servitude to God has no right to object to His rulings.</p>\n<p>So you must rectify your belief in God’s oneness and your faith in Him, by believing in His prophets and messengers and entering this great religion which God approves for His slaves and servants, so that you may attain happiness and save yourself from the Fire.</p>\n<p>We hope that your common senses and insight will lead you to that very soon, if God wills.</p>\n<p>We ask God to open and illuminate your heart, and guide you to that which will lead to your success.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She wants to marry a student like her and her family doesn’t agree",
      "question": "<p>A men, who I think is a very good muslim and Allah knows the best, has asked for my hand in marriage. I love him very much but my parents disapprove of this marriage for the following reasons. They think I am too young. They think that he (we) will not be able to support ourselves since both of us are students. They want me to finish school (i am in my last year of high school) and maybe even finish university before getting married for they think that is i get married i will not complete my studies. Please advise me on what i should do and what right i have in this.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah mercy on him) was asked a     similar question and said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ruling on that is that it is contrary to the command of the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose     religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him.” Undoubtedly your     father’s preventing you from marrying one who is suitable is something that is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and it does not mean     that you cannot study, because the two can be combined. What I advise my brothers who are the guardians of women to do, is to let them complete     their studies; a woman may stipulate as a condition of her marriage that she be able to continue studying until her studies are complete.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/704-705.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what you mention about the situation of the one who has proposed     marriage and that he is still a student, being a student is not regarded as an impediment to marriage if he can afford to get married and to spend     on his wife on a reasonable basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if his being a student means that he cannot afford to get married and spend on     his wife – apart from the unreasonable demands that some families make in the conditions that they stipulate – this is addressed by the words of     Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves     chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty”</p>\n<p>[al-Noor 24:33]</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this verse, Allaah commands everyone who is     unable to get married and cannot find any means of doing so to keep himself chaste, because the most common obstacle to marriage is lack of money.     So Allaah promises independence of means by His bounty, so that He will provide what one needs to get married or to find a woman who will accept a     small mahr, or else remove from him the desire to marry.” Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/242&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the mahr and maintenance are the rights of the woman, not     of her guardians. She has the right to agree to a little and to marry one whom she knows is poor, but it has to be pointed out that many woman may     agree to marry a man even though he is poor when he proposes to her, then shortly after marriage the woman may start to complain, and that leads     to arguments and divorce. This should be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise families and guardians not to be an obstacle to keeping their daughters     and female relatives chaste because of the unreasonable conditions that they stipulate regarding spending on the basis that they want to be     reassured about their daughters’ future. This puts off the men who want to marry them, which leads to them being left on the shelf and the evils     that result from that, especially nowadays when fitnah (temptation) is so widespread. Thus they harm themselves and their daughters when their     intention is to do good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My question is: I was employed in an association in 2000, in a position that does not suit my university degree. I applied many times for promotion competitions in order to run away from the pressure I was suffering from my manager. All my attempts to get promotion were in vain until 2002, I was offered by a friend to pay an amount of money in return for having a better job. There were 50 jobs available. I had to do this sheikh to get rid of that pressure. I did not take anyone’s place, also bear in mind that all who got these jobs are affluent people.  <br />\nIs the wealth I get from this work haram?

      "answer": "<p>There is no doubt that paying a bribe in order to get a job is haraam both for the one who pays the bribe and the one who accepts it, and for the one who mediates between them. No exception is made except in cases where the bribe is paid to remove injustice or to attain rights which can only be attained through bribery.

      "question": "<p>I give birth in the month of Sha‘baan, then I got sick, and the blood of nifaas only lasted for three days, then it stopped, so I did ghusl and prayed. No blood came out at all until the month of Sha‘baan ended and Ramadan began, and after one week of Ramadan had passed, the doctor prescribed an antibiotic for me, so I was fasting but there was no bleeding during the day; only a few drops appeared before Maghrib. This continued for the rest of the month of Ramadan, and I could not tell whether I had become pure or not, but I fasted the entire month. Should I repeat the fast or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is no minimum duration for nifaas. If a woman’s nifaas (post-partum bleeding) ends after giving birth, even after only a few days, then she should do ghusl and pray and fast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3sisdVY\" target=\"_blank\">Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</a> (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>When a woman becomes pure [i.e., the bleeding ends], even if it is only one day or a few days after giving birth, then she is taahir (pure) and she must pray; her fasting is valid and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen.</p>\n<p>It may be determined whether a woman has become pure – following menses or nifaas (postpartum bleeding) – by one of two signs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Emission of the white discharge.</li>\n<li>Complete dryness, so that there is no trace of blood or yellowish or brownish discharge.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/156224\">156224</a>.</p>\n<p>These few drops of blood that appeared after becoming totally pure from nifaas are not regarded as being part of nifaas. Based on that, the woman should pray and fast in that case.</p>\n<p>In Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 2, 4/259), it says:</p>\n<p>His wife gave birth on the ninth day of Ramadan, and nine days after giving birth the bleeding stopped, so she did ghusl and started to pray and fast, but she noticed when night came that there were a few drops of blood, but she did not see anything like that during the day. What is the ruling on that, and are her prayer and fasting valid?</p>\n<p>Answer: If this woman saw a complete cessation of bleeding or the white discharge, then her prayer and fasting are valid, because she comes under the same ruling as women who are taahir (pure, i.e., not menstruating or bleeding postpartum). What she sees of a few drops of blood at night is not regarded as nifaas and is not described as blood, so it does not come under the ruling on nifaas. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>There is a woman who, after two months of nifaas and after becoming pure, began to find some small drops of blood. Should she stop fasting and stop praying? Or what should she do?</p>\n<p>Answer: If this woman became pure and definitely saw the tuhr indicating that menses or nifaas had ended – by which I mean the emission of the white discharge, which is well known to women – then anything that appears after the tuhr of brownish or yellowish discharge, or spots of blood, or wetness, none of this is menses, so it does not prevent her from praying and it does not prevent her from fasting, and it does not prevent a man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menses. Umm ‘Atiyyah said: We used to regard the yellowish and brownish discharge as not being of any significance. Narrated by al-Bukhaari. Abu Daawood added: …after the tuhr. Its isnad is saheeh.</p>\n<p>Based on that, we say: Anything of that nature that happens after the tuhr has definitely occurred does not matter, and does not prevent the woman from praying or fasting or being intimate with her husband. But she should not rush until she sees the tuhr, because some women, when the bleeding stops, rush to do ghusl before seeing the tuhr. Hence the women of the Sahaabah would send their pieces of cloth – meaning the cotton on which there was blood – to Umm al-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and she would say to them: Do not be hasty, until you see the white discharge.

      "title": "Forms of receiving [money, in a transaction] include cheques, bank transfers and depositing of money in the [seller’s] account",
      "question": "<p>We are businessmen in an Arab country, and we deal with some European countries. In order to buy goods from these countries, we have to buy euros, but the state in which we live does not allow us to leave the country with euros, except for a very small amount that is not enough to pay for our purchase of goods there. This forces us to buy currency there in Europe, meaning that we pay dinars in our country before we leave, then later on we collect the foreign currency over there, in the country to which we travel when we want to buy goods. Other people pay bribes at the checkpoints in the airport in our country so that they will let them take the foreign currency abroad, but sometimes they are arrested, the money they have with them is confiscated and they are forced to pay a huge financial penalty. Is buying foreign currency in this way in order to avoid paying bribes and levies (mukoos) regarded as permissible or not? We do not have any other solution.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Trading in different currencies is called exchange, and in order for it to be permissible it is stipulated that the exchange takes place on the spot, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.” Narrated by Muslim (1587).</p>\n<p>Cash currencies take the place of gold and silver, so when buying one currency with another, that must be done “hand to hand.” This is what the fuqaha’ describe as “exchanging commodities in the same meeting as that in which the deal is done (meaning: on the spot).” In other words, it is not permissible for the seller and purchaser to part before each one receives the amount of currency that has become his through this deal.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Buying and selling currencies is permissible, but it is stipulated that the exchange be done hand-to-hand if the currencies differ. So if someone sells Libyan currency for American or Egyptian or any other currency hand to hand, there is nothing wrong with that, such as if he buys dollars with Libyan currency hand to hand, so he takes [the dollars] from him and hands over [the Libyan currency] on the spot, or he buys Egyptian or British or any other currency with Libyan currency or any other, hand to hand, there is nothing wrong with that. But if the exchange is to be done at a later date, that is not permissible. The same applies if the exchange does not take place in the same meeting – it is not permissible, because what you describe in the question is regarded as a type of riba-based transaction. So it is essential that the exchange be done on the spot, hand to hand, if the currencies are different. But if they are of the same type, then there are two conditions which must be met: the amounts should be equal and the exchange should take place on the spot, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver…”</p>\n<p>The ruling on currencies is the same as the ruling on gold and silver: if they differ, then it is permissible for their amounts to differ, but the exchange must take place on the spot. If they are of the same type, such as dollars for dollars or dinars for dinars, then the exchange must take place on the spot and be of equal amounts. And Allah is the source of strength.\"(<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp; 19/171-174).</p>\n<p>Receipt of payment may take several forms, including: cheques, bank transfers and depositing in the [seller’s] account.</p>\n<p>A statement was issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League during its eleventh session, in which it says:</p>\n<p>After studying and researching, the Council reached consensus on the following:</p>\n<p>1.. Receipt of the cheque takes the place of receipt of the money when the necessary conditions are met regarding exchange of currencies through bank transfers.</p>\n<p>2.. The recording of that in the bank’s records comes under the same ruling as receiving the money for one who wants to exchange one currency for another, whether that is on the basis of cash that the person brings to the bank or money that is already in his account. End quote.</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta were asked:</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on money that is exchanged from one currency to another? For example, I receive my salary in Saudi riyals and I exchange it for Sudanese pounds; please note that one Saudi riyal equals three Sudanese pounds.

      "title": "Does Feeling That Something Came Out of the Back Passage Break Wudu?",
      "question": "<p>After I defecate, I feel something coming out of the back passage. Sometimes there is something and sometimes I do not find anything. </p>\n<p>My question is: do I have to check my Wudu for every prayer? What about the prayers I did in the past? Do I have to repeat them? Please note that I do not know how many they are.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">If a person relieves himself, cleans himself, and then does Wudu, he is in a state of ritual purity until he is certain that there is something that has invalidated his Wudu. His Wudu does not become invalidated because of mere doubts, even if the doubt is so strong that he thinks it most likely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Based on this, merely feeling that something has come out of the back passage is not counted as invalidating Wudu. You should also beware of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/148426\" target=\"_blank\">whispers from Satan</a> . So long as you have done <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2137\" target=\"_blank\">Instinja</a> (washing the private parts with water) and cleaned the place properly, you do not have to check before praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The prayers that you have offered do not have to be repeated, because you were in a state of purity and you were not certain that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/212088\" target=\"_blank\">there was anything that would invalidate it</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This principle is indicated by the report narrated by Al-Bukhaari (137) and Muslim (361) from `Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that a man complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he imagined that he felt something when he was praying, and he said: “You should not stop (the prayer), unless you hear a sound or smell something (and odour).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">“This Hadith is one of the basic principles of Islam, and an important principle of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), which is that things remain as they are unless there is certainty that they have changed, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/145752\" target=\"_blank\">doubting what is certain does not affect it</a> . &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Another issue related to this Hadith is that if a person is certain that he purified himself and is uncertain that he has invalidated it, then the ruling is that he is still in a state of purity, and it makes no difference whether this doubt occurs during the prayer or outside the prayer. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars of the earlier and later generations. … Our companions said: With regard to doubt it makes no difference whether the two possibilities with regard to invalidation of purity are equal or not, or if one of them is more likely, or he thinks it most likely. He does not have to do Wudu in any case.” (Sharh Muslim)&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When I urinate and do Wudu then pray, I feel that something is coming out of my penis, and when I check it I find that some urine has come out. What is the solution?&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">“Undoubtedly in His wisdom, Allah has made strong nerves that control urine and faeces so that nothing comes out. But these nerves may be affected by sickness so that they become weak, then urine comes out either continuously or occasionally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A person may himself be the cause of that, because there are some people who, when they finish urinating, squeeze the urethra to the end of the penis, so as to extract the urine, and there are some who keep squeezing until the last drop of urine comes out. This is a mistake, even though some jurists say that it is Sunnah to extract the last drop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This is a weak view, and in fact is innovation, as was stated by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and as is obvious from the Sunnah, because there is no report that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) squeezed the urethra to the end of the penis, or that he squeezed it to extract the urine. But some people do that, either because they are following the opinion of the jurists who said that, or because they imagine that if they do not do that, there will be some urine left in the penis. But this is a mistake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">If a person urinates and washes the tip of the penis only, that is sufficient and there is no need to squeeze it or shake it. Rather he should wash the tip of the penis where the urine has got onto it, and that is the end of the matter, even if the person has gotten used to doing this because of this sickness of which he himself is the cause.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">My advice to him is: if this happens to you, do not pay any attention to it, do not squeeze the penis, rather leave it as it is. When the last drop of urine has come out, you should wash the tip of the penis, and you may feel something in his penis but you do not have to look, because some people, when they feel something in the penis, they pull down their trousers and start squeezing the penis from the end. But if one squeezes it something will inevitably come out. Rather you should leave it and not pay any attention to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Some of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: ‘In this case <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/100268\" target=\"_blank\">if he is affected by these whispers</a> , he should sprinkle some water on his trousers so that if he thinks or doubts, then he can assume it is this water.’&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But we say: there is no need for that, and this is too much. Do not do that, and do not pay any attention to it, and it will go away in sha Allah. If you feel some coolness at the tip of the penis or you feel something in the penis, do not go and look, and just ignore it.\" (Al-Liqa’ Al-Shahri)&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "One should not exaggerate in cleaning oneself after relieving oneself",
      "question": "<p>I have a serious problem when purifying myself from major impurity, because I purify myself with a little water, then I wipe myself sometimes 21 times and sometimes more than that, yet I still see traces, which makes me purify myself again with water. Hence I spend a long time in the washroom in order to cleanse myself, which has damanged my health. What is your opinion? Is there a specific number of times for wiping oneself in order to become pure?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The phrase major impurity applies to janaabah (impurity following sexual activity), menses and nifaas (postpartum bleeding). The way to purify oneself from that is: the woman should start by cleaning her private parts, then makes the water reach all parts of her body. That is explained in the answer to question <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10790\">10790</a>. With regard to the emission of wind, urine, stools and madhiy (prostatic fluid), this is minor impurity, and perhaps this is what you are referring to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: Minor impurity is that which necessitates wudoo’ but not ghusl, such as the emission of urine, stools and wind from the back passage, eating camel meat, and sleeping.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for major impurity, it is that which necessitates ghusl, such as intercourse and ejaculation as the result of desire, as in the case of a wet dream or otherwise, or menses or postpartum bleeding.'(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 3, 4/112).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Istijmaar or wiping oneself means removing impurity on both passages, front and back, with a stone or a tissue and the like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is required in istijmaar is that the number of wipes should be no less than three, and to achieve purity, which is the removal of the impurity and making the place dry. The sign that purity has been attained is that the last wipe should come back dry with no trace of impurity on it. And if that is done, then the purpose has been fulfilled and the place has become pure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (262) narrated from Salmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade us to clean ourselves with less than three stones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/102):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both things are stipulated together: purification and completing three; one of them done without the other is not sufficient. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i and a number of others. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: If men use stones to clean the back or front passage, how can women clean the front passage when there is no water?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: Cleaning oneself with stones or whatever takes their place, apart from bones and dung, takes the place of cleaning oneself with water when purifying the front and back passage. Men and women are the same in that regard. What is required is three clean stones for both back and front. If that is not sufficient, then it is essential to do more until it becomes clean. It is best to make it an odd number, so if it becomes clean after four wipes, it is prescribed to do a fifth, and if it becomes clean after six, it is prescribed to do a seventh, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever cleans himself, let him make it an odd number.”(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 2, 4/36)</p>\n<p>But if what you mean by istijmaar is washing the traces of impurity with water, no number is stipulated in this case, and what is required is to wash off the impurity until you think that it has most likely been removed. In this case it is sufficient to act upon what you think is most likely, and it is not stipulated that you should be certain that it has been removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should note that this exaggeration comes from the waswaas or whispers of the Shaytaan, who intends thereby to make worship difficult for the Muslim so that he will give it up or his life difficult and make him fall into distress and grief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have to limit yourself to that which is mentioned in sharee’ah without adding or taking away anything. If the shaytaan whispers to you that you have not purified yourself, do not pay any attention to this whisper, until Allah takes it away from you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: For a believer must be an enemy of the shaytaan, fighting him and resisting him, and not giving in to him. If he tells you that you did not do wudoo’ and did not pray, when you know that you did do wudoo' and pray, and you can see water on your hand and you know that you prayed, then do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allah, and affirm to yourself that you have prayed and be certain that you have done wudoo’, and do not repeat any of that. Seek refuge with Allah from the enemy of Allah, the Shaytaan. Thus the believer must be strong in fighting the enemy of Allah and resisting him so that he will not gain any power over him or harm him, because if he gains power over a person he will make him like one who is insane and will toy with him. So what the believer, man or woman, must do is beware of the enemy of Allah, seek refuge with Allah from his evil and his tricks, and be strong and patient in doing so, so that he will not obey him by repeating the prayer or by repeating wudoo' or by repeating the takbeer and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly, if he says to you: Your garment is impure, or this spot is impure, or there is some impurity in the bathroom, or there is some impurity on the ground that you walked on, or there is such and such in the place where you pray, then do not obey him in that. The enemy of Allah is lying. Seek refuge with Allah from his evil and pray in the place where you usually pray and on the mat on which you usually pray and on the ground that you walk on, and know that it is clean and pure, unless you see with your own eye some impurity that you stepped on when it was still wet, in which case wash your foot. And praise be to Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to his whispers, do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allah. Remember that the basic principle is that things are pure. This is the basic principle, so do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allah unless you are certain that you have seen it with your own eyes, so that the enemy of Allah will not gain any power over you. We ask Allah to keep us all safe and sound.\"(Fatawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb, 1/77. 78 )</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide you and help you to do all that is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Does zakaah have to be paid on honey?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Some of the scholars – including Imam Ahmad – are of the view that zakaah is due on honey. They quoted a number of texts as evidence for that, such as the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – The report narrated by Ibn Maajah (1824) from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took one-tenth of honey (as zakaah). Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Ibn Maajah: (it is) hasan saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – It was narrated from Sulaymaan ibn Moosa that Abu Sayyaarah al-Muta’i said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, I have bees. He said, “Give one-tenth (of their honey).” I said, O Messenger of Allaah, protect it for me. And he protected it for me. Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1823; classed by al-Albaani as hasan li ghayrihi in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sindi said in Haashiyat Ibn Maajah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In al-Zawaa’id, Ibn Abi Haatim said, narrating from his father: Sulaymaan ibn Moosa did not meet Abu Sayyaarah, and the hadeeth is mursal. Al-Tirmidhi narrated in al-‘Ilal from al-Bukhaari that this hadeeth is mursal, then he said: Sulaymaan did not meet any of the Sahaabah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Abu Dawood (1600) narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: Hilaal, one of Banu Mut’aan, came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with one-tenth of the honey from his bees, and he used to ask him to protect a valley for him that was called Salabah, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) protected that valley for him. When ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab became the caliph, Sufyaan ibn Wahb wrote to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab asking him about that, and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) wrote to him saying: “If he gives you what he used to give to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one-tenth of the honey from the bees, then continue to protect Salabah for him, otherwise there is no protection and anyone may take the honey who wants to.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That was also narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah have mercy on him), but the most correct view is that no zakaah is due on honey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad was asked: Are you of the view that zakaah is due on honey? He said: Yes, I am of the view that zakaah is due on honey, (at a rate of) one-tenth. ‘Umar took zakaah from them. I said: Were they giving it voluntarily? He said, No, he took it from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Mughni, 4/183-184&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority of scholars, including Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, are of the view that there is no zakaah on honey. They classed as da’eef (weak) the reports that were narrated about zakaah being due on it. They interpreted the saheeh reports concerning that as meaning that the one-tenth that was paid was in return for that protection, as is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth narrated from ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on the tithe (one-tenth) of that which is irrigated by rain and flowing water, and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez did not think that anything was due on honey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz said in Fath al-Baari:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi Shaybah and ‘Abd al-Razaaq narrated with a saheeh isnaad going back to Naafi’, the freed slave of ‘Umar, that he said: ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez sent me as governor of Yemen and I wanted to take one-tenth of honey, but Mugheerah ibn Hakeem al-San’aani said: There is nothing due on honey. I wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez and he said: He is right, there is nothing due on honey. And a contrary report was narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, which was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq, but its isnaad is da’eef (weak). The first report is more sound. It is as if al-Bukhaari is referring to the weakness of the report, “One-tenth is due on honey.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari said in his Tareekh: There is no saheeh report about zakaah on honey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Tirmidhi said: There is no saheeh report on this matter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shaafa’i said: The hadeeth, “One-tenth is due on honey” is da’eef (weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is no proven report concerning honey, nor is there scholarly consensus, so no zakaah is due on it. This is the view of the majority. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), “If he gives you what he used to give to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one-tenth of the honey from the bees, then continue to protect Salabah for him, otherwise there is no protection and anyone may take the honey who wants to.” indicate that what he took from Hilaal was not zakaah, rather it was in return for that protection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali mentioned in his book al-Furoo’ (2/447-450) the evidence quoted by those who said that zakaah must be paid on honey, and he discussed the evidence and proved that it is da’eef (weak), then he said: Whoever ponders that and other texts, will clearly see that the issue is weak. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is zakaah due on honey?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The correct view is that there is no zakaah on honey, because that was not narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Rather it was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) guarded the places where bees lived and took one-tenth from the beekeepers in return. Based on this, no zakaah in due on honey, but if a person gives it voluntarily, that is good, and it may be a cause of his bees increasing in number and producing more honey. But is not an obligatory duty, such that a person would be sinning if he does not give it, because there is no evidence to that effect. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Zakaah, p. 87&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee was asked: Is zakaah due on honey that is produced by bees or not?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No zakaah is due on honey that is produced by bees, rather zakaah is due on its value if it is prepared for sale and one year has passed, and its value reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab), in which case one-quarter of one-tenth is due.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/266.</p>\n",

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:21]</p>\n<p>He should also be certain that Islam is based on great wisdom, but this wisdom may be known to us or we may be unaware of it, or we may know some of it and not the rest of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with a person asking the reason and trying to find out, because knowing it will increase his knowledge and peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars have pondered the reason why Quran is recited out loud in the nighttime prayers and silently in the daytime prayers, and the summary of what they have mentioned concerning that is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The night is a time when people are quiet, alone and more focused, so it is prescribed to recite Quran out loud at that time so as to make manifest the pleasure of a person’s conversing with his Lord, and so that the heart, tongue and ears will be involved in the recitation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This meaning is suggested by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah).</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;Verily, there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties”&nbsp;[al-Muzzammil 74:6-7]</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The point is that this rising may be at any time of night. What is meant here is that when praying at night, both the heart and the tongue are focused on the recitation, hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” i.e., the mind will be more focused when reciting and will understand the words more than during the day, which is a time when people move about and there is a great deal of noise, and it is the time of seeking provision. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (19/40) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant is that the heart, sight, hearing and tongue work together in harmony when reciting Quran, because voices and movements are stilled. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said (p. 1058): “Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” i.e., it is more likely to achieve the purpose of the Quran, where both heart and tongue are focused, because there are fewer distractions, one can understand what one recites, and does the prayer properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is unlike the day, when these purposes cannot be achieved. Hence Allah says “Verily, there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties” – i.e., going about to attend to your needs and living, which means that the heart is distracted and cannot focus fully. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There remains the wisdom behind reciting out loud – what is it? It may be that it is because night is the time when one is alone and people get together for lighthearted talk. So it is prescribed to recite Quran out loud at that time so as to make manifest the pleasure of a person’s conversing with his Lord. This applies only to the first two rak’ahs because the worshipper has more energy then. Because the day is the time of distractions and mixing with people, it is required to recite silently, because the daytime is not the best time to focus fully on conversing with Allah. The morning (Fajr) prayer is joined to the night prayers because its time is not usually a time when there are distractions, like Friday. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (2/91):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the distinction between the nighttime prayers and the daytime prayers, in terms of reciting out loud and reciting silently, there is great wisdom in that, because the night is a time when voices and movements are stilled, and hearts are focused and have renewed energy. The day is the time when people are busy with their day-to-day occupations, and the night is the time when a person can focus with his heart on what he is saying with his tongue. Hence the Sunnah is to make the recitations in Fajr longer than in other prayers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite between sixty and one hundred verses in them, and Abu Bakr used to recite al-Baqarah in them, and ‘Umar used to recite al-Nahl, Hood, Bani Israa’eel, Yoonus and similar soorahs, because the heart is more free of distractions when it has just been wakened from sleep. If the first thing that a person hears is the word of Allah in which there is all goodness, then these words will come to his heart which is free form any distraction, and will thus have a great impact on him. As for the day, the opposite is the case, so Quran is recited silently unless there is a reason, such as the large gatherings on Eid and Jumu’ah (Friday), and when offering prayers for rain and the eclipse prayer. On those occasions it is better to recite out loud and that is more likely to achieve the objective and is more beneficial, and because this serves to convey the words of Allah when there is a large gathering.

      "title": "Is the son of her husband’s daughter regarded as a mahram for her?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for a woman who is over sixty to not wear hijab in front of the son of her husband’s daughter who is fifteen years old? He is like a grandson to her. Is it permissible for her to shake hands with him or kiss him? Her husband who is the grandfather of this boy has passed away.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly: The son who is asked about here is regarded as a     mahram for this woman, so she may shake hands with him and uncover in front     of him as she uncovers in front of her mahrams, and it makes no deference     that his grandfather is deceased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The way in which he is her mahram is that she is the wife of     his grandfather on his mother’s side. Permanently forbidden in marriage for     a man are his father’s and his grandfather’s wife, no matter how far the     line of ascent reaches, whether the grandfather is on his father’s side or     his mother’s, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except     what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an     evil way”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:22]</p>\n<p>It says in Zaad     al-Mustaqni’: The marriage contract makes the wife of the father and     every grandfather a mahram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     his Sharh: The marriage contract is valid, and makes forbidden in     marriage the wife of his father or grandfather, no matter how far the line     of ascent reaches. Every woman who has been married by his father, even if     he divorced her, is permanently forbidden in marriage to him, and the same     applies to every woman who was married by his grandfather, whether on his     father’s side or his mother’s. The evidence for that is the verse in which     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except     what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an     evil way”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:22]</p>\n<p>If he marries her, that     is worse than zina, because Allaah says concerning zina (interpretation of     the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a     Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an     evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:32]</p>\n<p>    But concerning this, Allaah says: “indeed it was shameful     and most hateful, and an evil way”. Marrying mahrams – Allaah forbid –     is worse than zina. Hence many of the scholars were of the view that the one     who commits zina with one of his mahrams, even if he is not married, is to     be killed. There is a hadeeth concerning that in al-Sunan. So the     wife of one's father or grandfather, not matter how far the line of ascent     reaches, is forbidden in marriage, whether on the father’s side or the     mother’s, and Allaah has not stipulated that the marriage should be     consummated etc, rather this ruling comes into effect by virtue of a valid     marriage contract. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/198&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a matter concerning which there is no difference of     opinion among the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him)     said, discussing the fact that a father’s wife is a mahram: It is the same     whether she is the wife of his father, or the wife of his paternal     grandfather, or the wife of his maternal grandfather, whether near or far.&nbsp;     There is no dispute concerning that among the scholars as far as we know,     praise be to Allaah. End quote from al-Mughni, 9/518, 524&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to kissing, she may kiss him so long as there is     no risk of fitnah, and it is better to kiss him on the forehead or head.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad (may Allaah     have mercy on him) was asked about a kissing a mahram man. He said: If he     has come from a journey and there is no fear (of fitnah). But it should     never be on the lips, only on the forehead or head.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn     Muflih, 2/266&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was     asked about kissing mahrams. He said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If kissing mahrams is done with desire or one fears that     desire may be provoked, it is haraam without a doubt. If there is no fear of     fitnah then there is nothing wrong with kissing on the head or forehead. As     for kissing on the cheek or lips, that should be avoided, except in the case     of a father and daughter or mother and son, for example. It is more lenient     in this case because Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon     ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was sick and kissed her     on the cheek, and said, “How are you, O my daughter?” End quote, from     Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 691.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows     best.</p>\n",

This is in accordance with the Muslim’s belief (‘aqeedah), and there is nothing wrong with it, because the unknown is something that is known only to Allaah. If it were the case that people could see the unseen and know of events before they happen, they would have achieved everything good and avoided everything bad. They would look at the causes of good health, wealth and happiness and they would pursue them, and they would look at the causes of poverty, disease and death and they would avoid them. But this is something hypothetical and impossible. The point is that man is incapable and weak and must submit to the fate that Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, has decreed for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe’”</p>\n<p>[al-A’raaf 7:188]</p>\n<p>It says in Tafseer al-Qur’aan il-‘Azeem (3/524):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best comment concerning this is what was narrated by al-Dahhaak from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “If I had knowledge of the unseen I would have acquired a lot of good” i.e., wealth. According to another report: “If I knew the unseen I would have known what would make a profit and what would not, and I would have made a lot of money and poverty would not have come my way.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Jareer said: Others said: What that means is: If I had knowledge of the unseen I would have prepared for the year of drought (by setting side something) from the year of plenty, and I would have known when prices were about to go up or down, so I would have saved for myself from the times when prices were low for the times when prices were high.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said: “and no evil should have touched me” I would have avoided evil before it happened. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Sa’di said in Tafseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan (p. 311): “If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me” means: I would have done the things that I know would have resulted in good and benefits for me, and I would have avoided everything that could lead to evil and negative consequences, because I would have known about things before they happened, and I would have known what they would lead to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But – because of my lack of such knowledge – bad things may happen to me, and I may miss out on good things. This is the clearest evidence that I have no knowledge of the unseen.

      "question": "<p>I have two daughters. The older one is six years old and the other is three years old. I wanted to do the ‘aqeeqah for the older one, so I got in touch with the butcher and he bought a ram for me for four hundred dollars, but the butcher did not know that it was an ‘aqeeqah, so he slaughtered it in the slaughterhouse and brought it to me already cut into pieces. But I had intended to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah and distribute the meat raw to relatives and the poor. Is it permissible to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah in the slaughterhouse or must it be slaughtered at home, and does the name of the one for whom the ‘aqeeqah is being offered have to be mentioned, as in the case of the udhiyah? If that is not permissible, is it permissible to regard that ram as charity, and buy another ram and slaughter it? If I have to offer another ‘aqeeqah, is it permissible for me to buy two lamb instead of one ram, because the price of one ram is equivalent to that of two lambs, and then can I slaughter them for my two daughters at the same time?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>In order for the ‘aqeeqah or udhiyah to valid, it is not stipulated that the name of the one who is offering the udhiyah or ‘aqeeqah be mentioned over it. It is also not stipulated that they be slaughtered at home; in fact it is acceptable for them to be slaughtered in a country other than the country of the one who is offering the udhiyah or the child for whom the ‘aqeeqah is offered.</p>\n<p>What matters is that the one who offers it intends that it be an udhiyah or ‘aqeeqah. It is not stipulated that the slaughterman or butcher be aware that it is an ‘aqeeqah or udhiyah. Based on that, that ram was acceptable as an ‘aqeeqah for your older daughter.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not essential to offer a particular type of livestock for the ‘aqeeqah. Either a male or female sheep is acceptable, and so is a lamb or goat. That is because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “For a boy, two sheep, and for a girl, one sheep, and it does not matter whether they are male or female.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1516); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>But in the case of the ‘aqeeqah, the same rulings are stipulated as for the udhiyah, that the animal should be free of defects and of the right age.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The same defects should be avoided in the case of [the ‘aqeeqah] as in the case of the udhiyah. To sum up: the rulings on the ‘aqeeqah are the same as the rulings on the udhiyah with regard to the age of the animal, and the same defects are to be avoided … So it is not acceptable to offer anything less than a six-month-old sheep or a one-year-old goat (i.e. it is in its second year), and it is not permissible to offer a one-eyed animal that is obviously one-eyed, or a lame animal that is obviously lame, or a sick animal that is obviously sick, or an extremely emaciated animal, or a mutilated animal that has lost more than half of its ear or horn. End quote from al-Mughni (7/366).</p>\n<p>The acceptable age for an ‘aqeeqah is five years in the case of a camel, two years in the case of a cow, one year in the case of a goat and six months in the case of a sheep.</p>\n<p>Based on that, you do not have to slaughter that which is most expensive. What matters is that the ‘aqeeqah be an animal that would be acceptable as an udhiyah, meaning that it has reached the right age and that it is free of defects.</p>\n<p>The ‘aqeeqah that you are going to offer later, in sha Allah, will only be for the younger daughter. As for the older daughter, we have explained above that the ram that was slaughtered was acceptable for her ‘aqeeqah.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/41899\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">41899</a> and <a href=\"/en/answers/82607\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">82607</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He is suffering from bleeding and blot clots in the brain – does he have to fast?",
      "question": "<p>My wife’s father is suffering from bleeding and blood clots in the brain, may Allaah heal us and you. He cannot move and he is totally paralyzed, but he may be able to lift a cup of water with help to drink, then he will continue to hold the cup for an hour if we forget him, because he does not realize that he has finished drinking. His memory is almost gone. The doctors are unanimously agreed that there is no cure except with Allaah. He has been in the situation and getting worse for six years, praise be to Allaah, and he cannot do without daily medicine and natural remedies. This is costing them thousands every month. He has not prayed since then and he has to be carried to the bathroom, and for a year or more he has had a catheter and he has no control over his urine or stools, and he cannot even signal to us that he needs tog o to the bathroom, no matter how hard we try to teach him to let us know by giving us some signal. He can hardly talk and he does not understand anything but he knows our faces and is moved when he hears sad stories, for example. We have tried to help him pray even if it is by moving his eyes, but he does not understand and he does not remember the verses and the tashahhud and the number of rak’ahs in each obligatory prayer. Does he have to offer any expiation for not praying? Or for not fasting in particular? Does he come under the heading of the sick whose families must offer the expiation for not fasting by feeding one poor person for every day? Or does he come under the heading of the insane or mentally disabled who have no understanding, so fasting and prayer are waived for them?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If     his memory is gone and his mind has changed so that he is not aware of     things, then fasting and prayer are waived in his case, and he does not have     to offer any expiation, because one of the conditions of being accountable     is that one should be of sound mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Pen has     been lifted from three: from the sleeping person until he wakes up, from the     minor until he grows up, and from the insane person until he comes to his     senses.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4403), al-Tirmidhi (1423), al-Nasaa’i     (3432) and Ibn Majaah (2041). Abu Dawood said: It was narrated by Ibn Jurayj     from al-Qaasim ibn Yazeed from ‘Ali from the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he added:&nbsp; “and the old man who is     feeble-minded.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This     hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It     says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood:&nbsp; “the old man who is feeble-minded”; this     refers to when the mind becomes weak in old age. Al-Subki said: This implies     that it is additional to the three (mentioned in the hadeeth), and this is     correct. What is meant is the old man who has lost his mind due to old age,     because an old man may become confused which prevents him from     distinguishing things, and means that he is no longer accountable, but it is     not called insanity and it does not say in the hadeeth “until he comes to     his senses,” because in most cases he will not recover from this before he     dies, and if he recovers for some of the time and comes back to his senses,     then he is accountable for that time… End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See:    al-Ashbaah wa’l-Nazaa’ir by al-Suyooti, p. 212&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Fasting is not     obligatory unless certain conditions are met: </p>\n<p>    1-        Being of sound mind</p>\n<p>    2-        Being an adult</p>\n<p>    3-        Being a Muslim</p>\n<p>    4-        Being able to do it</p>\n<p>    5-        Being a resident (i.e., not     travelling)</p>\n<p>    6-        Being free of menses and     nifaas in the case of women</p>\n<p>    1 –     Being of sound mind, the opposite of which is losing one's mind or reason,     whether that is due to senile dementia i.e., old age, or an accident which     has caused a person to lose his mind and awareness. This person does not     have to do anything, because of his loss of reason. Like the one who has     reached old age and reached the point of senility, he does not have to fast     or feed the poor, because he has lost his mind. The same applies to one who     is unconscious as the result of an accident or other cause; he does not have     to fast or feed the poor, because he is not aware. End quote from Liqa’     al-Baab il-Maftooh (4/220).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He     also said: The one who has lost his mind as the result of old age or an     accident and there is no hope of recovery, is not obliged to fast, like the     one who has reached a great age and become senile and can no longer speak     properly. He is like a child and is not obliged to fast. The same applies to     one who has had an accident and lost his mind in a way from which there is     no hope of recovery. But if there is the hope of recovery, such as if he is     merely unconscious, then he has to make up the fasts when he wakes up, but     if he has lost his mind completely then he does not have to fast, i.e., if     he does not have to fast then he does not have to offer the fidyah either.     End quote from Sharh al-Kaafi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What     appears to be the case is that he does not have to pray or fast, and there     is no need to feed the poor on his behalf instead of fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And     Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": " He speaks improperly with a woman, with the excuse that he is teaching her",
      "question": "<p>I am a girl who has been on the Internet for a short time, but I have noticed that some people are very confused and they mix truth with falsehood. From the way some of them speak, they appear to be good and pious, but some of the things they do are very strange.<br />\n When I first starting going on the Internet, some of the sites I went to were chat rooms. I admit that this was a mistake on my part, but I have put matters right, alhamdu-Lillaah. I stopped going into chat rooms two weeks after I started. But whilst I was visiting chat rooms I got to know a man who, from what he says, appears to be righteous and pious, and keen to pursue good. He tries to put right whatever he can, and he sends out letters containing words of religious exhortation by e-mail to everyone he knows. He goes into chat rooms on the basis of the belief and principle that he adheres to, which is that good people should be present in these sites, in which there are a lot of bad people, in order to crowd out the bad people.<br />\n The main thing is that I stopped going to the chat rooms, but I continued to communicate with him by e-mail. He was trying to persuade me that I had to go to the chat rooms in order to reform the women, because women are closer to other women, especially on sites where there are so many women that the “wolves” are tempted to come and “hunt” them. I did not respond to his request because I knew how damaging it is to go to those sites where the evil outweighs the good. The way he spoke to me in his letters was very respectful and he was very selective in the words he chose; I was equally careful in the way I spoke to him. This encouraged me to ask him to teach me the basics of the Internet via e-mail, or, if that was not possible, via “messenger”. He agreed to do that via “messenger” so we started the lessons, and he carried on being respectful and serious. But I noticed that sometimes he would joke or get carried away in talking about matters that had nothing to do with the lesson, which he called educational topics. And he also asked about some personal matters such as the city where I live, etc. I knew that he was in touch with a group of women with whom he discussed educational matters and the state of the Muslims, etc., and that these discussions might go on for hours. I did not like this state of affairs and I told him that frankly. I also told him that this joking was not permitted, and that he should be formal when speaking with women, and not use certain phrases. He quoted as evidence that it is permissible to speak with women the fact that the shaykhs answer questions from women; and he quoted as evidence that it is permissible to joke the hadeeth “No old women will enter Paradise” – meaning that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was joking with that old woman when he said that to her. He said that being too formal and reserved may lead to the opposite result. I was not convinced by his arguments, because from the little knowledge that I have, this is not permitted. I asked him to complete the lessons via e-mail and not to use the “messenger”, and until now he has not replied at all. I find it strange and wonder how he could do that when he has reached such a high level of knowledge and religious commitment, as well as being haafiz al-Qur’aan (i.e., he has memorized the Qur’aan by heart). I want to point out that this is a subtle trap that is one of the snares of the Shaytaan, by means of which he confuses people. What is the final word on this problem? Please excuse me for writing such a long question. May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>You should cut off all contact with this man immediately,           and make use of books and educational web-sites so that you will have           no need to consult him. Make sure that you yourself do not become a           means of misguiding a daa’iyah or haafiz in the first place by doing           something that is wrong. We ask Allaah to guide us, you and him, and           to make us all steadfast. </p>\n",

Then I want to ask about the phrase that refers to the one-eyed liar, i.e., “al-maseeh al-dajjaal,” because the first word (al-maseeh) could make one think that this refers to ‘Eesa, but the second word (ad-dajjaal) refers to a liar.

Apart from that, their hadiths are definitively proven, according to the more correct scholarly view, because they are supported by corroborating evidence and because the fact that the ummah unanimously accepts them indicates that they are sound.</p>\n<p>Ibn as-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him), in his <em>Muqaddimah</em> (p. 28-29), is of the view that the hadiths of <em>as-Saheehayn</em> are definitively sound and we should be certain about them, because the ummah is unanimously agreed on the soundness of the hadiths of <em>as-Saheehayn</em>, and the ummah is protected from error in its consensus – apart from a few hadiths in <em>as-Saheehayn</em> which some of the scholars critiqued, such as ad-Daaraqutni and others.</p>\n<p>But an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) commented [on what Ibn as-Salaah said] in <em>at-Taqreeb</em>, where he said:</p>\n<p>The shaykh stated that whatever both of them [al-Bukhaari and Muslim] or one of them narrated is definitively sound, and we are certain about any of the knowledge acquired from them, but the scholars who specialized in hadith and the majority of scholars disagreed with him and said: The hadiths are probably sound (and not definitively sound), unless they are mutawaatir.\" (<em>Tadreeb ar-Raawi&nbsp;</em>1/141).</p>\n<p>A number of the scholars who specialized in hadith followed the view of Ibn as-Salaah and differed from an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him). As-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ibn ‘Abd as-Salaam criticized Ibn as-Salaah for this view.</p>\n<p>Al-Bulqeeni said: What an-Nawawi and Ibn ‘Abd as-Salaam said, and those who followed them in this view, is not to be accepted. Some later scholars of hadith narrated a view similar to that of Ibn as-Salaah from a number of Shaafa‘i scholars, such as Abu Ishaaq, Abu Haamid al-Isfaraayeeni, al-Qaadi Abu’t-Tayyib and Shaykh Abu Ishaaq ash-Shiraazi; and from as-Sarakhsi among the Hanafis; al-Qaadi ‘Abd al-Wahhaab among the Maalikis; Abu Ya‘la, Abu’l-Khattaab and Ibn az-Zaaghooni among the Hanbalis; Ibn Foorak and most of the scholars of kalaam among the Ash‘aris; and all the scholars of hadith. The view of all of the salaf (early generations) is that the hadith that is widely accepted among the ummah is definitively sound.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam – meaning Ibn Hajar – said: What an-Nawawi mentioned in Sharh Muslim was by way of claiming that the majority agreed with him. As for those who specialized in hadith, no [they did not agree with him]. There were many specialized scholars who also agreed with Ibn as-Salaah.</p>\n<p>He (i.e., al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar) said in <em>Sharh an-Nukhbah</em>: The report that is supported by corroborating evidence is definitively proven, contrary to the view of some. The definitively proven reports are of several types, including those which were narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their <em>Saheehayn</em> which did not reach the level of being mutawaatir, but there is other corroborating evidence which supports them.</p>\n<p>That evidence includes: the great knowledge of al-Bukhaari and Muslim in this field, and their preeminence in distinguishing sound hadiths, in which they excelled others, and the fact that the scholars accepted and embraced the books. This acceptance alone is stronger evidence to prove that their hadiths are definitively sound than the hadiths which were narrated through many isnaads but did not reach the level of being mutawaatir. But this [superiority of the hadiths in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>] is limited to the hadiths concerning which none of the scholars expressed any reservations. … Apart from [those few hadiths], there is consensus that we should accept that they [the hadiths in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>] are sound and embrace them.</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer said: I agree with the view of Ibn as-Salaah.</p>\n<p>I (as-Suyooti) say: This is the view that I favour, and I have no other view concerning this issue.\" (<em>Tadreeb ar-Raawi</em>&nbsp; 1/142-145).</p>\n<p><u>The third type of hadiths which are definitively proven: those which the ummah unanimously accepts and embraces, even if they are not in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>,</u> because of what was noted above, that the ummah is protected from error in what it is unanimously agreed upon.</p>\n<p><u>The fourth type: the report which is widely circulated and is narrated through many isnaads which there is no problem.</u></p>\n<p>See: <em>an-Nukat ‘ala Kitaab Ibn as-Salaah</em>, by Ibn Hajar (1/378).</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars stated that the hadith which is narrated by a chain of narrators, all of whom are scholars of hadith – such as if Imam Ahmad narrated a hadith from Imam ash-Shaafa‘i, and ash-Shaafa‘i narrated it from Imam Maalik – this type of hadith is definitively sound and proven, because of the high calibre of its narrators. That is on condition that there should be more than one isnaad.</p>\n<p>See: <em>Tadreeb ar-Raawi</em> (1/144).</p>\n<p>All these types of hadith are definitively sound.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the mutawaatir report and the ahaad report that is supported by corroborating evidence on the basis of which it may be deemed to be definitive – such as that which the ummah accepted and embraced, whether it was in <em>as-Saheehayn</em> or in one of them, or it was narrated elsewhere – are to be regarded as definitively proven.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The sound view is the view of the majority, that a report may be deemed to be definitively proven sometimes because of the large number of narrators, or because of the qualities of the narrators, such as their strong faith and religious commitment and their strong memory. And sometimes a report may be deemed to be definitively proven because of corroborating evidence that supports the report, because of which it may be deemed to be definitively proven. Also, the report that the ummah has accepted and believed to be true or acted in accordance with it is to be deemed definitively proven, according to the majority of later and earlier scholars. This is similar to that which is mutawaatir.\" (<em>Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa</em>&nbsp; 18/48).</p>\n<p>Based on the above, if a hadith is one of these types, there is nothing wrong with quoting it without an isnaad, but it is better to mention which of the authors of the books of hadith narrated it, such as al-Bukhaari, Muslim and Ahmad. You should also quote which of the scholars classed it as saheeh, so as to reassure the listener or reader of the soundness of this hadith.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/122507\" target=\"_blank\">122507</a> .</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with saying “al-maseeh ad-dajjaal,” because when the word al-maseeh (messiah) is used on its own, it refers to al-Maseeh ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (the Messiah Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him). But when using the phrase “al-maseeh ad-dajjaal,” it is known that this refers to someone else.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The word “al-maseeh” refers both to the Dajjaal and to ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), but if we are referring to the Dajjaal, we must specify that. End quote.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8806\" target=\"_blank\">8806</a> .</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is proven in more than one hadith that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) referred to the Dajjaal as “al-maseeh ad-dajjaal.” As this is proven from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) you should not have any doubts or hesitate to use this phrase.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Who was Dhu’th-Thudayyah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Dhuth-Thudayyah’s full name was Hurqoos ibn Zuhayr al-Bajali. He was one       of the Khawaarij (Khaarijites) who rebelled against Ameer al-Mu’mineen       ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), spread mischief in the land and shed       blood that it was forbidden to shed. ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him)       fought them at the battle of an-Nahrawand and killed them; none of them       escaped except a few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) urged the     believers to fight them. The first of them was Dhu’l-Khuwaysirah at-Tameemi,     who told the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):     Be fair! And Dhu’th-Thudayyah was the last of them. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;He was a     very dark black man, who had a foul odour and a deformed arm; there was only     an upper arm, with no forearm, and at the end of his upper arm there was     something like a nipple on which there were some white hairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They (the     Khawaarij) are the ones concerning whom the Messenger of Allah (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him) said:     “Among the progeny of this man will be people who will recite     the Qur’an, but it will not go any further than their throats. They will     pass through Islam as an arrow passes through the prey. They will kill the     people of Islam and leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them,     then I will certainly kill them like ‘Aad (i.e., as ‘Aad were destroyed).”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Dhu’th-Thudayyah was the sign of these people; he was the sign of fitnah     (turmoil) and a symbol of mischief and evil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When ‘Ali     (may Allah be pleased with him) and the believers who were with him fought     them, he asked them to look for this man among the slain, and they found     him. ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and those who were with him     rejoiced greatly at that, and ‘Ali prostrated to Allah in gratitude.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>al-Bukhaari     (3610) and Muslim (1064) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be     pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was sharing out some     wealth, Dhu’l-Khuwaysirah, a man from Banu Tameem, came to him and said: O     Messenger of Allah, be fair! The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) said: “Woe to you! Who will be fair if I am not fair? You     will be doomed and lost if I am not fair.” ‘Umar said: O Messenger of Allah,     give me permission to strike his neck. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him be, for he has companions, in     comparison to whose prayer one of you would regard his prayer as     insignificant, and he would regard his fasting as insignificant in     comparison to their fasting. They recite the Qur’an but it does not go any     further than their collarbones. They will pass out of the faith as an arrow     passes out of the prey. Their sign will be a black man, one of whose upper     arms will be like a woman’s breast, or like a piece of quivering flesh. They     will emerge when there is division among the people.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Sa’eed     said: I bear witness that I heard this hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I bear witness that ‘Ali ibn     Abi Taalib fought them when I was with him. He ordered that that man be     sought, and he was found and brought; I looked at him and saw that he was     just as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     had described him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to     another report narrated by them (al-Bukhaari and Muslim):     “Among the progeny of this man will be     people who will recite the Qur’an, but it will not go any further than their     throats. They will pass through Islam as an arrow passes     through the prey. They will kill the people of Islam and     leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them, then I will     certainly kill them like ‘Aad (i.e., as ‘Aad were destroyed).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was     narrated that Naafi‘ ibn Maslamah al-Akhnasi said: Dhu’th-Thudayyah was a    man     from (the clan of) ‘Arnah from (the tribe of) Bajeelah. He was a very dark     black man who had a foul odour. He was well-known among the troops, and     before that he used to accompany us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bidaayah     wa’n-Nihaayah, 7/289&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Atheer     (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Dhu’th-Thudayyah – thudayyah     is the diminutive of thadiy (breast nipple) And may be taken as meaning a     piece of a breast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nihaayah,     1/592&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim     (1066) narrated from ‘Ubaydah as-Salmaani, from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased     with him) that he mentioned the Khawaarij and said: and said: Among them is     a man with a defective arm, or a small arm. I would tell you what Allah     promised on the lips of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     to those who kill them. I said: Did you hear that from Muhammad (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah;     yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah; yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah.</p>\n<p>Muslim     (1066) and Abu Dawood (4768) narrated that Salamah ibn Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn     Wahb al-Juhani told me that he was&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was in     the army that was with ‘Ali and went out to fight the Khawaarij. ‘Ali said:     O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be     upon him) say: “There will appear some people among my ummah who will recite     the Qur’an and your recitation will not compare to theirs, and your prayer     will not compare to theirs, and your fasting will not compare to theirs.     They will recite the Qur’an and you will think that it is to their credit     but in fact it will count against them. Their prayer will not go any deeper     than their collar bones and they will pass out of Islam as an arrow passes     out of the prey. If the army that attacks them knew what has been decreed     for them on the lips of their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him), they would have relied on their deeds. The sign of that is that among     them there is a man who has an upper arm but no forearm, and on his upper     arm there is something like a nipple with white hairs on it. Would you go to     Mu’aawiyah and the people of Syria, and leave these people in charge of your     families and wealth in your absence?&nbsp; By Allah, I hope that they are the     same people, for they have shed blood unlawfully and attacked the people’s     cattle. March in the name of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Salamah ibn     Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn Wahb described to me the stops (made by the army)     until he said: then we crossed a bridge, and when we met (the Khawaarij),     who were being led that day by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Wahb al-Raasibi, he (‘Abd-Allah)     said to (his men): Throw your spears and draw your swords from their     sheaths, for I am afraid that they may urge you to negotiate as they did on     the day of Haroora’. So they threw their spears and unsheathed their swords,     and (the companions of ‘Ali) fought back with their spears, and they (the     Khawaarij) were killed and piled up one on top of another, but only two of     the people (i.e., the companions of ‘Ali) were killed that day. ‘Ali said:     Search among them for the one with the deformed hand. But they did not find     him. Then ‘Ali himself went to some people who had been killed and were     lying on top of one another. They took them out and found him among those     who were closest to the ground (at the bottom of the pile). He said takbeer     and said: Allah spoke the truth and His Messenger conveyed it. ‘Ubaydah al-Salmaani     stood up and said: O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, by Allah besides Whom there is no     other god, did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, by Allah besides Whom there is no     other god – until he asked him to swear three times and he did so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then Abu     Dawood narrated that Abu’l-Wadee’ said: It is as if I can see him, an     Abyssinian wearing a shirt, one of his hands like a woman’s nipple with     hairs on it like the hairs on the tail of a jerboa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Classed as     saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad (850)     narrated that Taariq ibn Ziyaad said: We went out with ‘Ali to fight the     Khawaarij, and he killed them then he said: Look, for the Prophet of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that there would emerge     people who would speak of the truth but it would not go past their throats;     they will pass out of the truth as the arrow passes out of the prey. The     sign is that one of them will be a black man with a deformed arm, with some     black hairs on his arm. If it is him, then you have killed the worst of     people, and if it is not him, then you have killed the best of people. And     we wept, then he said: Look. So we looked and we found the deformed man, and     we fell down in prostration and ‘Ali fell down in prostration with us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadeeth     has several isnaads; see al-Irwa’, 2/231&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz     (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was     narrated that Abu Maryam said: Indeed that deformed man was with us in the     mosque, and he was a poor man. I gave him a burnous of mine to wear and I     saw him attending meals with ‘Ali. He had on his arm something like the     breast of a woman, with a nipple on its end like the nipple of a breast,     with something on it like the whiskers of a cat. Both reports were narrated     by Abu Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At-Tabari     narrated it at length via Abu Maryam. In it, it says: Before that, ‘Ali used     to tell us that some people would appear and the sign would be a man with a     deformed arm. I heard that from him many times until I saw him – meaning the     deformed man – not wanting to eat with ‘Ali because he often heard that from     him. And in it, it says: Then he instructed his companions to look for the     deformed man, so they looked for him but they could not find him until a man     came and told him: We have found him beneath two slain men in a ditch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to     the report of Aflah: ‘Ali said: Which of you recognises this man? One of the     people said: We recognise him; this is Hurqoos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to     the report of ‘Aasim ibn Shamkh, Abu Sa‘eed said: Ten of the Companions of     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told me that ‘Ali     said: Look for the sign that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) spoke of, for I have never told lies and I will never     tell lies. He (that man) was brought, and ‘Ali praised and thanked Allah     when he recognised the sign. In the report of Abu Bakr, the freed slave of     the Ansaar, from ‘Ali, there were seven nipples around it. In that report it     states that the people were upset after the killing of the people of the     river, but ‘Ali said: I do not think but he was one of them. They found him     on the bank of the river, beneath the slain. ‘Ali said: Allah and His     Messenger spoke the truth. The people rejoiced when they saw his body, and     what they had been feeling disappeared.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote     from Fath al-Baari, 12/298&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more     information on the sect of the Khawaarij (Kharijites), please see the answer     to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/182237\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">182237</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah     knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Her parents are refusing to have an Islamic celebration; what should she do?",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on an Islamic celebration if the parents do not agree? Do I have the right to object to them or should I agree to what they say and give it up?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by an Islamic celebration is a party that is held in accordance with Islamic guidelines, so that it is free of the evils of mixing and women showing their adornments in front of men, and using music and immoral singing, and other things that Allaah has forbidden. These haraam things, unfortunately, are widespread in many Muslim celebrations nowadays, except for those on whom Allaah has mercy. What is prescribed with regard to wedding parties is to bring joy and happiness to both bride and groom and their families and those who come to congratulate them in ways that do not incur the wrath of Allaah, such as using the duff (a kind of hand drum) among women, and their singing for one another using words that carry beneficial meanings and are free of sin. Al-Bukhaari (5163) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that she presented a woman as a bride to an Ansaari man, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: “O ‘Aa’ishah, did not have any entertainment? For the Ansaar are fond of entertainment.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Majaah (1900) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‘Aa’ishah arranged a marriage for a female relative of hers among the Ansaar, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and said, “Have you taken the girl [to her husband’s house]?” They said, Yes. He said, “Have you sent someone with her to sing?” She said, No. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The Ansaar are people with romantic feelings. Why don’t you send someone with her to say, ‘We have come to you, we have come to you, may Allaah bless you and us’?” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1995).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nasaa’i (3369) and Ibn Majaah (1896) narrated that Muhammad ibn Haatib said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What differentiates between haraam and halaal is (beating) the daff and raising the voices (in song) at the time of marriage.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wedding parties in Islam are parties which combine bringing of joy and happiness to those present with modesty, dignity and avoidance of haraam things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Women should celebrate the wedding separately from men, and do what is appropriate to them to bring happiness to the wife and the people around her, such as providing entertainment, telling jokes and singing to the accompaniment of the duff, and eating and drinking, and doing other things that may vary according to customs and traditions, so long as it is within the circle of permissibility.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same applies to the men; they should gather in a separate place and exchange congratulations, and pray for blessing for the couple. It is Sunnah for the husband to offer food to be eaten by those present, without any extravagance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aim behind wedding parties is to announce the marriage and to make it distinct from haraam relationships, and to bring happiness to the couple, their families and friends, whilst attaining true submission to Allaah in all of that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the parents refuse to adhere to shar’i rulings in the wedding party and they insist on including some evils, such as allowing mixing or wanton display (tabarruj), or bringing a female singer or dancer to perform in front of men, then you have to advise them, and explain the shar’i ruling on such evils, and remind them that marriage is a blessing from Allaah for which they should give thanks, and gratitude is to be shown by obedience, not disobedience, and the marriage that begins with sin is unlikely to be blessed. If they respond, then praise be to Allaah, but if they persist in their view, then keep away from the place of evil [?] and announce your dislike and disavowal of it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’ 4:140]</p>\n<p>al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is obligatory to avoid people who commit sin if they do any evil action openly, because the one who does not avoid them is approving of their action. Allaah says “certainly in that case you would be like them”, so everyone who sits in a gathering where sin is committed and does not denounce it will share an equal burden of sin with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should denounce them if they speak of sin or do it; if he is not able to denounce them then he should leave them so that he will not be one of the people mentioned in this verse. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim (49). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11446\">11446</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7577\">7577</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You do not have to agree to the evil, or give up your stance of adhering to the rulings of sharee’ah in weddings and otherwise, in order to be among the victors who are blessed in this world and in the Hereafter. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to guide you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>When I get some money from my father or mother, I give it in charity and keep a little. When I ask them for money they say, “Where did your money go?” I tell them a lie and say that I bought stuff with it. The reason why I tell this lie is that I want Allaah to increase their good deeds. Is it permissible for me to lie to them or should I tell them the truth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      The basic principle concerning telling lies is that it is       one of the signs of the hypocrites, because the Prophet  (peace and       blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are       three: when he speaks, he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and       when he is entrusted with something he breaks that trust.” Narrated by       al-Bukhaari, 32; Muslim, 89.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But there are some instances in which Islam permits lying, if     that serves a greater purpose or wards off a greater harm:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    These cases include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-When a person is intermediating     in order to bring about reconciliation between two disputing parties.</p>\n<p>    2-When a man speaks to his wife,     or a wife to her husband, concerning matters that will increase the love     between them.</p>\n<p>    3-War.</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from Umm Kulthoom bint ‘Uqbah that she heard     the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     say: “He is not a liar who brings about reconciliation among people, conveys     good words and says good things.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2546; Muslim, 2605&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Asma’ bint Yazeed said: The Messenger of     Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Lies are not     appropriate except in three cases: when a man speaks to his wife to please     her, telling lies at times of war, and lying in order to bring about     reconciliation between people.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Albaani said: it is hasan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What you have mentioned is no excuse for telling lies to your     family. If you are honest with them they will never be deprived of the     reward for spending on you. And you can combine your family’s spending on     you and their giving in charity to the needy by encouraging them to spend     for the sake of Allaah, with no need to tell lies about buying stuff when     you have not done so. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to correct your intention and set your affairs     straight, and to reward you greatly for your desire to benefit your family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "His wife’s family stipulated that he has to become rich before they will send his wife and children back to him",
      "question": "<p>I am suffering from many problems with my wife’s family. I married their daughter thinking that they were religiously committed, then I found out that they adhere to customs and traditions (rather than religion). They took my wife from me by force and I am have no power or status in this world, there is no power and no strength except with Allaah. She gave birth in their house and now they do not want to send my daughter or my wife back to me unless I become very rich. Please note that they have given my wife the choice between going with me and they will be angry with her, or staying with them until I become rich. My wife knows that I am in the right and they are in the wrong, but they are following their ways. What should I do according to Islam?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wife has     no right to go out of her husband’s house without his permission, and her     family have no right to help her or encourage her to do that, because her     leaving and not returning constitute disobedience towards her husband and     rebellion against him which makes her guilty of nashooz (wilful defiance).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their taking     their daughter away is another act of wrongdoing, and their stipulating that     you must become very rich before they will return your wife to you is     wrongdoing upon wrongdoing. They have no right to do any such thing. When     they accepted the marriage and the marriage contract was done and the     husband paid the mahr, they were obliged to hand the wife over to the     husband, so how about when she was with him and had borne him a child!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You do not     say anything about your financial situation, and whether you have enough to     spend on your wife or not. Are you hard up or do you have enough to spend on     yourself and your family? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority     of scholars are of the view that the husband’s inability to spend on his     wife is sufficient grounds for separating them, if the wife requests that.     But if she accepts it and does not ask for separation, then no one has the     right to separate them. See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/254 and     29/58).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should     take the following steps to get your wife back:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1-Reconcile between yourself and     Allaah, may He be exalted, so that you can reconcile between yourself and     other people.</p>\n<p>    2-Ask Allaah to divert harm from     you, and to suffice you against the evil of all evildoers.</p>\n<p>    3-Try to reach an understanding     with your wife’s family and find out what their attitude really is. They may     have other reasons apart from the issue of wealth.</p>\n<p>    4-Appoint religiously committed     and righteous people to intervene and advise them, and explain to them the     seriousness of their wrongdoing and aggression.</p>\n<p>    5-Refer the matter to the courts,     to have your wife and daughter returned to you.</p>\n<p>We ask     Allaah to make things easy for you and to help you to do that which He loves     and which pleases Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah     knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Will her deceased husband be punished because his mother delayed giving his wife her due share of the inheritance?",
      "question": "<p>My husband died before the marriage was consummated, and I have an inheritance with his mother, but she is depriving me of it and will not give me the value of that share. Almost one year has passed; am I obliged to give zakaah on it? I do not know how much it is.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, will my husband be punished or kept from being granted bliss in his grave because of the delay in sharing out of the inheritance? In order for him not to be punished, do I have to let him off with regard to my mahr and my inheritance?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Taking possession and gaining ownership of the wealth is one of the       conditions of zakaah being obligatory; there is no zakaah on wealth when       possession and ownership thereof is not established, because when       possession and ownership are not established, the owner of the wealth       cannot dispose of it in his own interests, so it is more appropriate that       no one else should be entitled to any rights over it before possession and       ownership are established.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My     father died – may Allah have mercy on him – and he left behind in his estate     some money that was deposited in bank accounts. Because the division of this     money to the heirs was not completed until after more than two years had     passed since the death of our father for a number of reasons, some of which     were beyond our control and others were due to the fact that some of the     heirs live abroad and were late in appointing someone to attend court, and     it took some time for those banks to decide about division of the estate, no     zakaah has been paid on that money since the death of our father, may Allah     have mercy on him. As a little more than two years have passed since then,     should the zakaah be paid on the shares of all the heirs put together or     should it be paid on each share on its own, and what is the rate of zakaah?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The committee replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     the situation is as described, then no zakaah is due on the wealth of your     father for the two years during which the estate was not divided, because it     was not possible for each of the heirs to take possession of his share, for     reasons that were beyond the control of the heirs, and because some of the     heirs were far away and they were scattered, which was a cause of the delay     in the division of the estate being carried out, as you mentioned. So the     share of each heir comes under the ruling on wealth the ownership of which     is not established, and one of the conditions of zakaah being valid is that     possession and ownership should be established. But when each heir has taken     his share of the estate, if one full year passes and it reaches the minimum     threshold (nisaab), then zakaah becomes due at the rate of one quarter of     one tenth (2.5%). End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, you do not have to pay zakaah on any inheritance which you     have not been able to take possession of or have it at your disposal, or     know the value thereof, because your ownership is not established and you     are not able to dispose of it in your own interests or in the interests of     anyone else. If you do become able to take possession of it or dispose of     it, then you must pay zakaah on it from the time when you become able to     dispose of it, if it reaches the minimum threshold, when one full year has     passed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your husband will not be punished for what his mother does of delaying your     inheritance or depriving you of the inheritance to which you are entitled,     so long as he did not leave instructions to that effect or ask his mother to     deprive you of the inheritance, and he did not approve of that during his     lifetime, because he has no control over this wealth after his death. When     he died, it passed to his heirs and it is now the property of his heirs, and     is not his property. So he will not be accountable for what others do with     his wealth. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):    “On no soul does Allah place a burden greater than it can bear. He gets     reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that     (evil) which he has earned” [al-Baqarah 2:286].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (6442) narrated that Ibn Mas‘ood said: The Prophet (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Which of you loves the wealth of his     heir more than his own wealth?” They said: O Messenger of Allah, there is no     one among us but his own wealth is dearer to him than that of his heir. He     said: “Verily his wealth is that which he has sent on ahead (by spending it     in charity and good causes, so the reward for it is stored up for him), and     the wealth of his heir is that which he has kept back.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    After his death it is described as his heir’s wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Haafiz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Everything that the deceased leaves behind becomes the property of the heir.</p>\n<p>    End quote from Fath al-Baari (11/260)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please see also question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/117209\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">117209</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>This           is the view of some heretics and misguided people, both in the past           and nowadays. In modern times, those who expressed this view include           Saalih Abu Bakr in his book al-Adwaa’           al-Qur’aaniyyah; Husayn Ahmad Ameen in Daleel al-Muslim al-Hazeen; Ahmad Ameen in Fajr           al-Islam; ‘Abd-Allaah al-Na’eem in Nahwa Tatweer al-Tashree’&nbsp;           al-Islaami; Sa’eed al-‘Ashmaawi in Haqqeeqat           al-Hijaab; Saalih al-Wardaani in his misleading book Rihlati           min al-Sunnah ila al-Shee’ah; ‘Abd al-Jawaad Yaaseen in al-Sultah fi’l-Islam; Nasr Abu Zayd in Imaam           al-Shaafa'i; Zakariya ‘Abbaas Dawood in Ta’ammulaat           fi’l-Hadeeth; Hawlat Nahr in Diraasaat           Muhammadiyyah; Maurice Bucaille in&nbsp; Diraasat           al-Kutub al-Muqaddisah; Murtada al-‘Askar in Khamsoon           wa Mi’ah Sahaabi Mukhtalaq; Dr. Mustafa Mahmood in Maqaalaat           ‘an al-Shafaa’ah.</p>\n<p>We           say: it is true that there were fabricators and liars who made up words           and attributed them to the Messenger of Allaah            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but the matter is not quite           so simple as imagined by those doubters who also spread doubts among           others. They are unaware of the facts about how the Muslims took care           of the Sunnah. Alongside the fabricators, there were great numbers of           narrators who were trustworthy and highly skilled, and a large number           of scholars who surrounded the hadeeths of the Messenger of Allaah            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with a strong barrier which           was difficult for the liars to penetrate. By means of their vast knowledge           and deep insight, these muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth) were able           to spot the liars and understand their intentions and motives, and they           were able to detect everything that was falsely attributed to the Messenger           of Allaah  (peace and blessings           of Allaah be upon him). These fabricators were not given free rein to           do as they wished with the ahaadeeth of the Prophet            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they were given no           room to penetrate the ranks of trustworthy narrators of ahaadeeth without           being detected.</p>\n<p>Who           else exposed the lies of these kaafirs, heretics and extreme innovators?</p>\n<p>Who           were the ones who gave us the definition of what is fabricated, the           reasons for fabrication, different types of fabrications and the signs           by which a fabricated report may be recognized?&nbsp; Who wrote so many           books on this issue?</p>\n<p>They           are the guardians of Islam, the vicegerents and troops of Allaah on           His earth. They are the brilliant scholars of whom Haaroon al-Rasheed           spoke when he arrested a heretic and ordered that he be executed. The           heretic said, “Why are you executing me?” Haaroon al-Rasheed said, “To           rid the people of you.” The heretic said: “O Ameer           al-Mu’mineen, what will you do about the thousand ahaadeeth           – according to one report, four thousand ahaadeeth – which I have fabricated           and spread among you, in which I made what is halaal haraam and what           is haraam halaal, of which the Prophet uttered not one letter?” Haaroon           al-Rasheed said to him: “What will you do, O enemy of Allaah, about           Abu Ishaaq al-Fazaari and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak? They will go           through them and sift them letter by letter.” (Tadhkirat           al-Huffaaz by al-Dhahabi, 1/273; Taareekh           al-Khulafaa’ by al-Suyooti, p. 174).</p>\n<p>Professor           Muhammad Asad said: “The existence of fabricated ahaadeeth cannot be           taken to prove that the entire system of hadeeth is not to be trusted,           because these fabricated ahaadeeth never deceived the muhadditheen as           some European critics claimed, oversimplifying the matter, and as was           echoed by some who claim to be Muslims.” (al-Islam ‘ala Muftaraq al-Tareeq, p. 96) </p>\n<p>We will end this           discussion by quoting what was said by Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah:           Imaam Abu’l-Muzaffar al-Sam’aani said: “If they say: there are too many           reports in the hands of the people and they have become confused, we           say: no one is confused except those who are ignorant. Those who have           knowledge of them (the reports) check them as stringently as those who           deal with money check dirhams and dinars. So they single out (and discard)           the false reports and keep the good reports. If there happens to be           a narrator who made a mistake, this will not go unnoticed by the brilliant           scholars of hadeeth. These scholars listed the mistakes made in both           the isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (texts) of&nbsp; reports; so           you can see that for each narrator they made a list of the mistakes           that he had made and the letters that he had mispronounced. If the mistakes           of the narrators – in both the isnaad and the matn – did not go unchecked,           then how could the fabricated ahaadeeth manufactured by the heretics           have slipped past those brilliant scholars?&nbsp; How could people have           narrated ahaadeeth from heretics without the scholars noticing? That           is the view of some heretics, but no one would say such a thing except           one who is ignorant, misguided, an innovator and a liar who wants to           undermine the saheeh ahaadeeth and true reports of the Prophet            (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and confuse ignorant people           by means of this lie. There is no evidence for rejecting the reports           of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace           and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that is weaker or more impossible           than this. The one who voices this view deserves to be silenced and           expelled from the Muslim lands.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My father has died and he is a kaafir. What are my responsibilities towards him? Should I bury him and arrange his funeral? Should I wash him and shroud him or not? Are there any rights that my father has over me in this respect?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that Naajiyah ibn Ka’b narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ‘Your old, misguided uncle has died (he was referring to his father Abu Taalib). Who will bury him?’ He said, ‘Go and bury your father.’ [I] said, ‘I will not bury him, for he died as a mushrik.’ He said, ‘Go and bury him, then do not do anything until you come to me.’ So I went and buried him, then I came to him with traces of dust and earth on me. He told me to wash myself, then he made du’aa’ for me in words that were more precious to me than everything on earth.”</p>\n<p>(al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, by al-Albaani, no. 161)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Shaykh said, commenting on this hadeeth:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – It is allowed for the Muslim to take care of the burial of his mushrik relatives. That does not cancel out his hatred of their shirk. Do you not see that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) initially refused to bury his father for that very reason, as he said, “he died as a mushrik.” He thought that if he buried him when this was the case, that this was included in the forbidden kind of friendship as referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allah”</p>\n<p>[al-Mumtahinah 60:13]</p>\n<p>When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) repeated the command to bury his father, he hastened to obey him and he gave up the notion that had initially occurred to him. This is what obedience means: that a person gives up his opinion in response to the command of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It seems to me that a son’s burying his mushrik father or mother is the last act of good companionship that the son can do for his mushrik parent in this world. But after the burial, he cannot make du’aa’ for him or pray for forgiveness for him, because of the unambiguous words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin”</p>\n<p>[al-Tawbah 9:113]</p>\n<p>If this is the case, then how can people pray for mercy and forgiveness in the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the kuffaar, in death announcements for money! Let the one who has any concern for his hereafter fear Allah.</p>\n<p>2 – It is not prescribed for him to wash or shroud a kaafir, or to offer the funeral prayer over him, even if he was a relative, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell ‘Ali to do that. If that were permissible, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have said so, because it is well known that it is not permitted for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to delay explaining something at the time when that information is needed. This is the view of the Hanbalis and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – It is not prescribed for the relatives of a mushrik to follow his funeral, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that in the case of his uncle, although he was the one who was the most kind and compassionate towards him, and he even prayed to Allah to make his punishment the lightest punishment in Hell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all of that there is a lesson for those who are deceived by pride in their lineage and who do not strive for their Hereafter with their Lord. Allah indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another”</p>\n<p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:101]</p>\n<p>al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albaani, p. 94</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We     praise Allaah for having enabled you to adhere to the path of guidance and     righteousness and we ask Him, may He be glorified and exalted, to grant you     more of His bounty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The woman should endeavour to marry one who is religiously committed and of     good character, who can protect her and take care of her, and enable and     help her to practise her religion, as well as help her to raise righteous     children in accordance with the principles and morals of Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there     comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then     marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do     not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.”     Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1084) from Au Hurayrah; classed as hasan by     al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Marriage is not valid except with a wali (guardian), and a woman has no     right to marry herself, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage without a wali.” Narrated by     Abu Dawood (2085), al-Tirmidhi (1101) and Ibn Maajah (1881) from Abu Moosa     al-Ash’ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman     who gets married without the permission of her wali, her marriage is     invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid… and if there is     any dispute, then the ruler is the wali of the one who has no wali.”     Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi (1102); classed     as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 2709.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the wali refuses to marry the female relative under his care to a     compatible man with whom she is pleased, then he is preventing her from     getting married and guardianship passes from him to the next closest male     relative on the father’s side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by     preventing her marriage is preventing her from marrying a compatible man if     she asks for that and each of them wants to marry the other…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And whether she asked to get married for a mahr (dowry) like that of her     peers or less. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     she wants to marry a specific compatible man, and he wants her to marry some     other compatible man, and refuses to marry her to the one whom she wants,     then he is preventing her marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if she asks to marry someone who is not compatible, then he has the     right to refuse that and he is not regarded as preventing her marriage. End     quote from al-Mughni (9/383).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because guardians usually prevent marriage in such cases, there is nothing     wrong with the woman referring the matter to the shar’i judge, who may then     ask the guardians to do her marriage. If they refuse then he may do her     marriage himself. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) said, as in the hadeeth quoted above: “and if there is any dispute,     then the ruler is the wali of the one who has no wali.”     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this, your marriage contract is valid and it is not permissible to     annull it, because the shar’i judge became your wali after your father     refused to arrange your marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to honour your parents and treat them kindly, and uphold ties of     kinship with them even if it is only by speaking to them on the phone, until     they calm down and you are able to&nbsp; visit them, for parents’ rights are     great. Hence the duty to honour them is mentioned repeatedly in the Qur’aan,     as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his     parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything     (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me     is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do”</p>\n<p>    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his     parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and     hardship, and his weaning is in two years __ give thanks to Me and to your     parents. Unto Me is the final destination.</p>\n<p>    15.&nbsp;But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in     worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them     not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him     who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your     return, and I shall tell you what you used to do”</p>\n<p>    [Luqmaan 31:14, 15]</p>\n<p>    You have no right to cut them off, rather you must strive to calm them down     and put their minds at rest, and soften their hearts with money and gifts to     earn their love, and ask Allaah to guide your family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I got a letter from someone who said in it “By the life of the One who sent down the Qur’aan.” Is it permissible to swear using this phrase?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Swearing by the life of the     One Who sent down the Qur’aan is swearing by one of the attributes of     Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, namely the attribute of life. The     texts of the Prophet’s Sunnah indicate that it is permissible to swear by     the attributes of Allaah. These are saheeh texts which are narrated in the    Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, and the scholars quoted them as     evidence concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bukhaari (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on swearing by the     glory of Allaah and His attributes and words.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be     pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) used to say: “I seek refuge in Your glory.” Abu Hurayrah said that     the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man     will remain between Paradise and Hell and will say: ‘O Lord, turn my face     away from the Fire and by Your glory I will not ask You for anything     else.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be     pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) said: “Allaah said: ‘You will have that and ten times as much.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Ayyoob (peace be upon     him) said: “By Your glory, I cannot do without Your blessing.” End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saheeh al-Bukhaari,    Kitaab al-Aymaan wa’l-Nudhoor (Book of Oaths and Vows), chapter no.     12. Although al-Bukhaari quoted these ahaadeeth as mu’allaq reports here, he     recorded their isnaads in full elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bayhaqi also     narrated these ahaadeeth in al-Sunan al-Kubra (10/41), and included     them in a chapter entitled:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on what was     narrated about swearing by the attributes of Allaah, such as His glory,     majesty, power, greatness, words, hearing and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under this title he     narrated a report from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), which     says that he was asked about alcohol and he said, “No, by the hearing of     Allaah, it is not permissible to sell it or to buy it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr     (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Swearing by the attributes     of Allaah is permissible and expiation is required [if the oath is broken],     because they are part of Him, may He be exalted. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Istidhkaar     (5/205)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Rushd (may Allaah have     mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for those who regard it     as impermissible to swear by the attributes and actions of Allaah, this is a     da’eef (weak) view. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bidaayat al-Mujtahid     (1/298).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn     Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that     swearing by His attributes is like swearing by Him, such as if he says “By     the glory of Allaah” or “By the life of Allaah” or “By the Holy Qur’aan”. It     is proven from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     and the Sahaabah that it is permissible to swear by the divine attributes     and the like. And swearing by His attributes is like seeking refuge in them,     and refuge can only be sought with Allaah, as in the words of Allaah, “I     seek refuge in Your countenance” and “I seek refuge in the perfect words of     Allaah” and “I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath” and so on. This     is something that is affirmed by the scholars. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Fataawa al-Kubra     (4/130).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is what has also been     stated by the fuqaha’ of the four madhhabs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Kaasaani al-Hanafi (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person says, “By the     glory of Allaah, by the greatness of Allaah, by His Majesty, by His pride”,     then he is swearing an oath, because customarily and usually when these     attributes are mentioned, what is meant is Allaah Himself. So what the     person who swears such an oath intends is to swear an oath by Allaah.     Similarly, people are used to swearing oaths by these attributes, and there     is no report to suggest that sharee’ah forbids swearing oaths by them. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’     (3/6).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever wants to swear an     oath, let him swear by Allaah” should not be understood as meaning that     permissible oaths are limited to swearing by this name only; rather the     ruling on all the names of Allaah is the same as the ruling on this name. So     if a person swears by al-‘Azeez (the Almighty) or al-‘Aleem (the     All-Knowing) or al-Qaadir (the All-Powerful) or al-Samee’ (the All-Hearing)     or al-Baseer (the All-Seeing), then it is a permissible oath. There is     scholarly consensus on this point. The same ruling applies to an oath sworn     by the attributes of Allaah, such as saying “By the glory of Allaah, by His     knowledge, by His power” and so on. This is a case where the focus is on the     attributes of Allaah. There should be no dispute, because these are oaths     like the first kind. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mufhim lima ashkala     min Talkhees Saheeh Muslim (4/623).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Zakariya     al-Ansaari, the imam of the Shaafa’is of his time (may Allaah have mercy on     him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An oath may be sworn by     saying “By the knowledge of Allaah, or by His power, or by His truth, or by     His greatness, or by His hearing, or by His sight,” and so on. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Asna’l-Mataalib Sharh     Rawd al-Taalib (4/244).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah the imam of     the Hanbalis of his time (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Swearing by the attributes     of Allaah, may He be exalted, is like swearing by His names. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mughni     (9/395).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may     Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with     swearing an oath by saying “By the life of Allaah”, because oaths may be     sworn by Allaah, and by any of His names, or by any of His attributes, such     as life, knowledge, glory, power and so on. So it is permissible for one who     is swearing an oath to say: “By the life of Allaah, by the knowledge of     Allaah, by the glory of Allaah, by the power of Allaah” and other attributes     of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.

Not having intercourse on that night is not a sin, and does not prevent one from celebrating the waleemah (wedding feast). Whatever happens between the two partners on their wedding night is their concern alone, and they know best what will suit their own personalities. This is a good opportunity to remind Muslim men and women of the importance of verifying whatever they hear, and to warn them not to accept Islamic rulings from people who are not qualified to give them.

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Hadhrat Muaaz (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:</div>\n<div>\"Whoever taunts a brother (Muslim) with a sin (which the Muslim has committed), will not die until he the taunter) commits the same sin.\"</div>\n<div>Could you please xplain this Hadith in further detail?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, (Kitaab Sifat al-Qiyaamah wa’l-Wara’, 2429), where the wording is,&nbsp; “Whoever shames his brother for a sin will not die until he does it too.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Albaani described this hadith in Da’eef al-Jaami’ (5710) as mawdoo’ (fabricated).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a hadith is da’eef (weak) and mawdoo’ (fabricated), it cannot be taken as a basis for rulings or be acted upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the meaning of the hadith, Shaykh al-Mubaarakfoori said:</p>\n<p>“ ‘Whoever shames’ means whoever criticizes or condemns. ‘his brother’ means his brother in faith. ‘For a sin’ means one from which he has repented, according to the way in which Imaam Ahmad explained it. ‘will not die’ – the subject of this verb is ‘whoever’. ‘Until he does it too’ means, the sin for which he criticizes his brother. It is as if the one who criticizes his brother will be forsaken by Allah until he commits the sin for which he criticized his brother, if that criticism was accompanied by self-admiration for being free of that sin.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 7/173)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact that this hadith is da’eef (weak) does not mean that it is permissible to criticize those who have fallen into sin, for those who fall into sin are of different types.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of them repent and turn back to their Lord, or else the punishment (hadd) is carried out on them. So it is not permissible to criticize them because their souls have been purified by their repentance or the punishment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who has never sinned.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4240; classed as saheeh by al-Busayri in al-Zawaa’id, commentary on Sunan Ibn Maajah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad said that the punishment mentioned in the hadith is for the one who criticizes a person who has repented from his sin, as al-Tirmidhi narrated from him.&nbsp; After narrating this hadith, he said: Ahmad said: from a sin from which he has repented.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of them commit sin but they do not do it openly. Anyone who comes to know of that has to advise the person and cover his faults.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And some of them commit sin openly. They should also be advised, and others should be warned against them to whatever extent is appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It may be that what he meant is that your criticizing your brother for his sin is an even greater sin than his, because it means that you feel pride in your obedience and you are praising yourself for that, and claiming to be free from sin, whereas your brother has fallen into sin. But it may be that his feeling humble because of his sin and what has happened to him, such as his feeling humble and submissive, thinking less of himself, ridding himself of pious pretensions, arrogance and self-admiration, standing before Allah with his head bowed, his gaze lowered and his heart broken – it may be that all of that is better for him than your feeling proud of your obedience, thinking that you are doing much good, believing that by doing so you are important, and reminding Allah and mankind of that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How close this sinner is to the mercy of Allah, and how close this conceited one is to the wrath of Allah! A sin that leads to humility is more beloved to Him than an act of obedience which fills a person with conceit. If you sleep all night then wake up feeling regret (for not having prayed qiyaam al-layl), that may be better for you than if you were to pray all night and wake up in the morning filled with self-admiration. For the deeds of the one who admires himself are not accepted. Perhaps your laughing whilst admitting to shortcomings is better than your weeping with piety but being filled with conceit. The groaning of the sinners is more beloved to Allah than the tasbeeh of the conceited. It may be that by means of this sin, Allah has caused him to drink the medicine that will cure a fatal disease which you also have, but you do not realize it. Allah has reason for what He does to both those who are obedient and those who sin, which are known to no-one except Him, and which no one recognizes except those who have insight, and then only within the limits of human understanding; beyond that there are reasons which are not even known to the honourable scribes (i.e., the recording angels). The Prophet said: “If the slave woman of any one of you commits adultery, let him carry out the punishment on her and not criticize.” And Yoosuf (peace be upon him) said: “No reproach on you this day” [Yoosuf 12:92 – interpretation of the meaning]. For the scale is in the hand of Allah, and the ruling is His. The point is to carry out the punishment (prescribed by Allah) and not to shame and criticize. No one feels safe from what has been decreed for them and from the power of His decree except those who are ignorant of Allah. Allah said to the one who had more knowledge of Him than anyone else and was closer to Him: “And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little”[al-Israa’ 17:74 – interpretation of the meaning]. And Yoosuf said: “Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of the ignorant”[Yoosuf 12:33 – interpretation of the meaning]. One of the ways in which the Messenger of Allah used to swear was “No, by the One who turns hearts.” And he said, “There is no heart which is not between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful. If He wills He guides it aright and if He wills He sends it astray.” Then he said, “O Allah, the one Who turns hearts over, make our hearts steadfast in adhering to Your religion. O Allah, musrif al-Quloob, sirf our hearts to obey You.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/177, 178)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is my destiny, to paradise or hell if I was a daughter of adultery and I was just written in the name of the man I live with as father? What shall I do? Shall I expose this reality and go to detention? Or just stay silent and conceal my family’s secret? How shall I live with a brother who is not from the same father? May Allah forgive my mother, she destroyed me. I am a religious girl, Alhamdulillah. Do not suppose this is untrue and ask for a proof that I am not his daughter, because there is strong resemblance between me and the man whom my mother committed adultery with. Help me, what shall I do?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The child of adultery is not responsible for the crime     committed by his mother, and he is not to be taken to task for it, rather he     is responsible for his own actions. If he is righteous and obedient then he     will be one of the people of Paradise, and if he is a disobedient evildoer     then he will deserve to enter Hell. So in this regard he is like all other     people, and there is no difference between him and them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a woman has a husband and she bears a child who could be     from that husband (in that he is born after six months of marriage), then     this child should be attributed to her husband according to sharee’ah, and     it is not permissible to deny that he belongs to him, unless the husband     himself denies it and engages in li’aan with his wife to that effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari     (2053) and Muslim (1457) which says that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas and ‘Abd ibn     Zam’ah disputed concerning a slave belonging to Zam’ah.&nbsp; Sa’d said: O     Messenger of Allaah, this is the son of my brother, ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas,     who asked me to take care of him because he is his son. ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah     said: This is my brother, O Messenger of Allaah, the son of my father’s     slave woman who was born in my father’s bed. The Messenger of Allaah (S) saw     a clear resemblance to ‘Utbah. But he said: “He is yours, O ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah.     The child is for the (owner of the) bed.” Then he said to Sawdah bint     Zam’ah, who was one of the Mothers of the Believers (may Allaah be pleased     with them): “Observe hijab from him, O Sawdah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the child was born in the marital bed, he is to be     attributed to the husband, and he cannot be regarded as not being his child     except by means of li’aan, where the husband engages in li’aan with his wife     and denies that the child is his, in which case physical resemblance is of     no significance. It is clear from the hadeeth quoted above that the child     concerning whom there was a dispute bore a clear resemblance to the zaani,     ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas. This case of zina had taken place during the     Jaahiliyyah (i.e., before Islam), and Sa’d wanted to attribute the slave to     his brother who had left instructions to that effect (before he died), but     the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ruled that the     child belonged to the marital bed and attributed him to Zam’ah, who was the     master of the slave woman. But in order to be on the safe side, he told     Sawdah bint Zam’ah to observe hijab before this brother of hers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So in this case there was both an admission of zina and a     clear resemblance (to the zaani), but despite that the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) affirmed that the child was to be     attributed to the owner of the marital bed. This is because sharee’ah takes     a cautious view in order to protect lineages and is keen to conceal sins,     for the lineage is the child’s right.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh     Muslim: With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Observe hijab from him, O Sawdah”, he     told her to do that so as to be on the safe side, because he appeared to be     her brother in shar’i terms, because he was attributed to her father, but     when he saw that he clearly resembled ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas, he was afraid     that he may have been his child, in which case he would be a stranger     (non-mahram) to her, so he told her to observe hijab before him in order to     be on the safe side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The     custom during the Jaahiliyyah was to name children after the zaani. They     used to hire slave woman for zina, and whoever the mother said that the     child belonged to, they would name him after him. Then Islam came and     abolished that, and ruled that the child belonged to the legitimate marriage     bed. When ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah and Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas disputed, Sa’d did what     his brother ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas had asked him to do, in accordance with     the custom of Jaahiliyyah, and Sa’d was not aware that this had been     abolished in Islam. The child’s paternity had not been stated during the     Jaahiliyyah, either because there was no claim or because the mother did not     acknowledge that he was ‘Utbah’s child. ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah claimed that he had     been born on his father’s bed, so the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) ruled in his favour. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: They were     unanimously agreed that if a child is born on one man’s bed and another man     claims him, he should not be named after him. End quote from al-Mughni     (6/228).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if you were born six months or more after your     father married your mother, then you should be named after your father, and     your lineage cannot be denied except by means of li’aan. You have no need to     have doubts about your mother or think badly of her because you resemble     someone else, because people may resemble one another without there being     any zina.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Whatever the case, resemblance to the zaani or the woman’s     admission of zina does not mean that the child cannot be attributed to the     husband, unless the husband engages in li’aan. See the answer to question     no. <a href=\"/en/answers/33615\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">33615</a> for information on li’aan and its consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What you should do is ignore this matter and stop thinking     about it, and pay attention to doing righteous deeds and adhering to this     religion properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to guide you and help you to do that which He     has permitted and that which pleases Him. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Obligation of treating co-wives fairly and some of the rules on travel for men with more than one wife",
      "question": "<p>I would like to know if it is allowed for a man, when he is married to two wives to take the second wife every time if he will travel, even if the first wife cannot go because of her children. What can she do if she feels that he do not want to divide his time equally between them. Please advice a good website with answers on polygamy.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has enjoined justice and fairness in all things. He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Allah commands justice [and] the doing of good”&nbsp;[al-Nahl 16:90]</p>\n<p>Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this Book that He revealed to you, O Muhammad, Allah enjoins justice, which is fairness.\"(Tafseer al-Tabari&nbsp; 17/279).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has forbidden injustice and wrongdoing (zulm) to His slaves, and He warns those who are unjust or do wrong of punishment in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, narrating from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted: “ ‘O My slaves, I have forbidden zulm to Myself and I have made it haraam among you, so do not wrong one another.” Narrated by Muslim (2577).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has enjoined justice and fairness between co-wives, and there is a warning against wronging one of them at the expense of another. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:3]</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., the one who wants to take two or three or four wives may do so, but no more than that, because the context of the verse reminds people of the blessings of Allah, so it is not permissible to add anything to the number that Allah has defined, according to scholarly consensus. That is because a man’s desire may not be fulfilled by one wife, so it is permitted for him to take more, up to four, because four is sufficient for anyone, except in rare cases. However, that is only permitted to him if he is confident that he will not be unfair and unjust, and that he will be able to give them their rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is afraid that any of this applies to him, then he should limit himself to one, or to slaves that his right hand possesses, because he is not obliged to divide his time equally when it comes to slave women.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“That”, i.e., limiting yourself to one or to what your right hand possesses (slave women)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice” i.e., being unfair or unjust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Limiting it to one applies in the case where a person fears he may be unjust or unfair, and may fail to do what is required, so he should err on the side of caution and not put himself in that position.\"(Tafseer al-Sa’di&nbsp; p. 163).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives and favours one of them over the other, will come on the Day of Resurrection with one of his sides leaning.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1141), Abu Dawood (2133), al-Nasaa’i (3942) and Ibn Majaah (1969). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb (no. 1949).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Teebi said in his commentary on the words “with one of his sides leaning”, i.e., tilting. And it was said that this will be in such a way that all the people on the Day of Resurrection will see him, so this will increase his punishment.\"(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi&nbsp; 4/248).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a wife sees that her husband is favouring her co-wife at her expense, or is being unjust to her with regard to her rights, she should hasten to advise her husband in the way that is best, and remind him of what Allah has enjoined of justice, and what Allah has forbidden of injustice. She should also hasten to advise her co-wife not to accept this injustice, and not to take anything that is not rightfully hers. Perhaps Allah will guide him to be just and to give each one her due rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One aspect of justice between co-wives is for the husband to draw lots if he wants to travel with one wife and not the other(s). This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with his wives. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to go out on a journey, he would cast lots between his wives and the one whose name was drawn, he would take her with him.</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhari (2454) and Muslim (2770).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This shows that if a man wants to travel with one of his wives, he should cast lots between them. In our view this casting lots is obligatory.\"(Sharh Muslim&nbsp; 15/210).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for him to choose one of his wives to travel with him except by drawing lots.\"(Al-Muhalla 9/212).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Something similar was said by al-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in al-Sayl al-Jiraar (2/304).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he comes back from his trip, he should not count the period of his trip for the wife who travelled with him as the result of drawing lots. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he comes back from his journey, he should resume the division of his time among them, and he should not count the days of the one with whom he travelled. The hardship that the wife who accompanied him went through as the result of travelling is in return for the time she got to spend with him.\"(Al-Tamheed&nbsp; 19/266).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is assumed that one of his wives was not able to travel with him, it is pointless to include her in drawing lots, when she is unable to travel with him. In that case, lots should be drawn among those whose circumstances allow them to travel, and lots should not be drawn between those who are able and those who are not. But this is based on the assumption that this is the truth and not just an illusion or based on mistreatment of her, such as if she is sick or she has children and cannot leave them without someone to look after them, or she is not allowed to travel, and other such reasons, and it is not because he wants the other wife to travel with him and not the first one. Otherwise he is being unjust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this case he has to try to please both wives, even if it means making it up to the one who is not travelling by spending extra time with her when he comes back from his trip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi said: That varies according to women’s situations, and the prescription of drawing lots applies only if their situations are the same, lest one of them go out with him without a reason to make him take her and not the other(s).\"(Fath al-Bari&nbsp; 9/311).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Ahmad al-Rayyaan said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the wives’ situations are the same in all aspects, then drawing lots is a must. But if his wives differ in that, there is nothing wrong with choosing, so long as he pays attention to the principles of not favouring one of them and not aiming to cause harm.\"(Ta’addud al-Zawjaat&nbsp; p. 71).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We do not know of any site that deals specifically with issues of plural marriage.

      "title": "Weakness of a hadith about the virtues of Ramadan",
      "question": "<p>How sound is the hadith narrated from Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him) in which he is reported to have said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha’baan and said: ‘O People, there has come to you a great and blessed month, a month in which there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Allah has made fasting (this month) an obligation and spending its nights in prayer an act of voluntary worship. Whoever draws near to Allah during this month by doing some good deeds is like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and the one who does an obligatory action during this month is like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other times. It is a month whose beginning is mercy, its middle is forgiveness and its end is ransom from the Fire…’”??</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh, 3/191, no. 1887. He said, “If the report is saheeh …” but the word ‘if’ was omitted in some references such as al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb by al-Mundhiri (2/95), so they thought that Ibn Khuzaymah said, “The report is saheeh,” although he did not state that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by al-Mahaamili in al-Amaali (293); by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan (7/216); Fadaa’il al-Awqaat, p. 146, no. 37; by Abu’l-Shaykh Ibn Hibbaan in Kitaab al-Thawaab; it was attributed to him by al-Saa’aati in al-Fath al-Rabbaani (9/233); it was mentioned by al-Suyooti in al-Durr al-Manthoor, and he said, it was narrated by al-‘Aqeeli and he classed it as da’eef (weak); it was mentioned by al-Isbahaani in al-Targheeb, and by al-Munaqqi in Kanz al-‘Ummaal (8/477). All of them narrated it via Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib from Salmaan al-Faarisi. The isnaad of the hadith is da’eef (weak) for two reasons, which are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – There is a break in the chain of narrators, because Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib did not hear it from Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>2 – Its isnaad includes ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’aan, of whom Ibn Sa’d said: “There is some weakness in him and he cannot be quoted as evidence. He was classed as da’eef (weak) by Ahmad, Ibn Ma’een, al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Khuzaymah, al-Jawzjaani and others, as it says in Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 5/207.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Haatim al-Raazi judged the hadith to be munkar (a kind of weak hadith). Al-‘Ayni said likewise in ‘Umdat al-Qaari’, 9/20, as did Shaykh al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah, vol. 2/262. no. 871. So it becomes clear that the isnaad of this hadith and similar reports are all da’eef (weak), and that the muhadditheen (scholars of hadith) judged it to be munkar, in addition to the fact that it contains some phrases whose authenticity is subject to further examination, such as its dividing the month into three parts, saying that the first ten days are mercy, then forgiveness, then ransom from the Fire. There is no evidence for this, rather the bounty of Allah is immense, all of Ramadan is mercy and forgiveness, and there are those whom Allah ransoms from the Fire every night and at the time of breaking the fast, as is proven by the ahaadeeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, in this hadith it says, “Whoever draws near to Allah during this month by doing some good deeds is like one who does an obligatory action.” There is no evidence for this, rather naafil actions are naafil and obligatory actions are obligatory in Ramadan and at other times. This hadith also says, “and the one who does an obligatory action during this month is like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other times.” This number is subject to further examination, because a good deed earns a reward between ten and seven hundred times in Ramadan and at other times, and nothing is exempted from that apart from fasting, for its reward is immense and unlimited, because of the hadith qudsi: “Every deed of the son of Adam is for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I shall reward for it.” (Agreed upon; narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We must beware of da’eef (weak) hadith and make sure of their status before we speak of them. We must strive to find out the saheeh ahaadeeth about the virtues of Ramadan. May Allah grant us all strength and accept our fasting, night prayers and all our good deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n",

This invalidates wudu according to scholarly consensus…</p>\n<p>The second type is that which is rare, such as blood, worms, stones and hair. This also invalidates wudu. That is the view of ath-Thawri, ash-Shafa`i, Is-haq and as-hab ar-ra’y. ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, Abu Majlaz, al-Hakam, Hammadi, al-Awza`i, and Ibn al-Mubarak narrated that wudu is required if worms come out of the back passage, whereas Malik did not think that wudu was required for this type, because it is rare…</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Mughni</em>, 1/230.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em>, 17/112:</p>\n<p>That which comes out of the front and back passages rarely, such as worms, stones, hair, pieces of flesh and the like, is regarded as minor impurity which invalidates wudu according to the majority of jurists (the Hanafis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis). This is also the view of Ibn `Abd al-Hakam among the Malikis.</p>\n<p>This was also the view of ath-Thawri, Is-haq, ‘Ata’ and al-Hasan, because it comes out of the front or back passage, so it is akin to madhiy. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said in his <em>Ta`liqat `ala al-Kafi li Ibn Qudamah</em> (1/128):</p>\n<p>The correct view is that there is no difference between that which ordinarily occurs and that which rarely occurs. So if stones, worms, hair and the like come out of the back passage, it invalidates wudu. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “… unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.” If wind, which has no substance, invalidates wudu, then it is more appropriate to say that that which has substance also invalidates wudu. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Dubyan ad-Dubyan said: It seems that what matters is where it comes from, not whether it is impure or not, because wind is pure, but if it comes out of the back passage, it invalidates wudu, but if it comes out of the mouth (that is, burping), it does not invalidate wudu; what matters is not whether it is something that ordinarily happens or not, because wadiy is something that happens rarely and is not common, and it may be indicative of a health issue, yet despite that it invalidates wudu even according to the view of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him).</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Ahkam at-Taharah</em>, 10/631.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_it_obligatory_to_clean_oneself_istinja_if_worms_come_out_of_the_back_passage\"><strong>Is it obligatory to clean oneself (istinja’) if worms come out of the back passage? </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Although it is proven that if worms come out of the back passage, that invalidates wudu, it does not make it obligatory to clean oneself, because the reason for cleaning oneself (istinja’) is the presence of impurity, and the purpose behind cleaning oneself with water or pebbles is to remove substance of the impurity from the surface of the body.</p>\n<p>Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that cleaning oneself is not required if worms come out, except in the case where they contaminate the anus and the surrounding area with impurity. But if they do not contaminate the anus, then there is no requirement to clean oneself if they come out.</p>\n<p>It says in Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi (1/113), which is a book of Maliki jurisprudence:</p>\n<p>Similar to wind in the sense that there is no requirement to clean oneself are: stones and worms, if they come out free of moisture, or the amount of moisture is small.</p>\n<p>But if they come out with a great deal of moisture, then it is obligatory to clean oneself with water or pebbles, even if they do not invalidate wudu, as we shall see below. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ar-Rafi`i ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If something comes out of the passage, it should be examined: if it is not contaminated [with impurity], such as worms or stones on which there is no moisture, then there are two scholarly views as to whether it is required to clean oneself. The more sound of the two views is that it is not required to clean oneself with either water or pebbles, because the purpose of cleaning oneself is to remove the impurity from that place or reduce it. So if the place is not contaminated and did not become impure, then there is no sense in trying to remove or reduce the impurity…</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fat-h al-`Aziz</em>, 1/477.</p>\n<p>Al-Mardawi al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to impurity that does not cause contamination, there is no difference of scholarly opinion regarding the fact that it is obligatory to clean oneself of it. As for impurity that does not cause contamination and that which is pure, the correct view in our madhhab, which is also the view of the majority of our companions, is that it is obligatory to clean oneself of it.</p>\n<p>And it was said that there is no requirement to clean oneself of something pure that comes out, or something that is impure but it did not contaminate the place…</p>\n<p>By analogy, there is no obligation to clean oneself from that which comes out dry and does not contaminate the area. The same applies if what comes out is pure, such as maniy (semen), if we deem it to be pure, because cleaning oneself (istinja’) is only prescribed in order to remove impurity, and there is no impurity in this case. It says in <em>Al-Furu`</em>: This is more likely to be the correct view. It says in <em>Ar-Ri`ayah al-Kubra</em>: This is more correct based on analogy. I say: it is the correct view. How can someone clean himself with water or pebbles from something that is pure? Or how can he clean himself with pebbles from something that came out and did not cause any contamination? Does that make any sense?</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Insaf</em>, 1/232-234.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>… There is no requirement to clean oneself of what is pure. Also exempted is that which does not cause contamination because it is dry. So if something comes out that does not cause contamination because it is dry, there is no requirement to clean oneself of it, because the purpose of cleaning oneself (istinja’) is to purify oneself, but in this case there is no need for that. But if something rare, such as a stone, comes out, is it obligatory to clean oneself?</p>\n<p>The answer to that is: if it causes contamination, then it is obligatory to clean oneself, because it comes under the general meaning of the author’s words. But if it does not cause contamination, there is no obligation to clean oneself because there is no need for that.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Ash-Sharh al-Mumti`</em>, 1/140-141.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em>, 4/116:</p>\n<p>If what comes out is something unusual, such as stones, worms or hair, there is no requirement to clean oneself of it if it comes out dry, whether it is regarded as pure or impure.</p>\n<p>But if it has some moisture and contaminates the place, then you must clean yourself of it, but if it does not contaminate the area, there is no need to clean oneself of it according to the Hanafis and Malikis; this is also the earlier view of both the Shafa`is and Hanbalis. End quote.</p>\n<p>Based on the above, what you mention about your feeling the worms come out even though you were not able to see them means that there is no requirement to clean yourself, because in this case only two scenarios may apply:</p>\n<p>Either your feeling that was not correct; rather it was only an itch or some sensation in that place, and no attention is to be paid to such things.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/89888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">89888</a>.</p>\n<p>Or you were not able to see them because they are very small. In that case it cannot be imagined that it would contaminate the place where it came out, and it would not leave behind any contamination that could be seen, so there is no requirement to clean oneself of it because there is no proof that any impurity is present.</p>\n<p>But we should point out that what matters is not looking at the worms that come out; rather you should look at the place and see whether there is any contamination from the worms in the first place. This is something that you can find out and determine, even if it is by wiping the area with a tissue and the like, if you are not sure whether there is any contamination.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My period was one week late, after which I fell whilst walking, and I started to bleed. It seems that there was a pregnancy which had not yet taken human shape, because it was approximately one month. I waited, on the basis that it was a period, but it lasted for ten days, and my period is usually five days only, and I am still bleeding. Should I do ghusl, wear a pad and pray and complete the rituals of my Hajj, and regard it as istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a woman has a miscarriage before eighty-one days of pregnancy, the bleeding that happens is not regarded as nifaas; rather it is istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), unless it coincides with the usual time of her period, in which case it is menstrual bleeding.</p>\n<p>Istihaadah does not prevent a woman from praying, fasting and doing tawaaf, but she has to do wudoo’ at the time of each prayer.</p>\n<p>As this time is close to the time of your period, and the menses may come late or come early, and the basic principle is that what comes out of a woman is menses, then it seems that you should regard the bleeding you have as menstrual, and whatever lasts longer than the five days of your normal period should also be regarded as menses, so long as it does not go beyond the longest time for menses, which is fifteen days according to the majority, or last longer than a month according to those scholars who do not think that there is any maximum length of menses, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and those who agreed with him.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/65903\">65903</a>.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the bleeding that you are experiencing is menses, and is not to be regarded as istihaadah unless the bleeding lasts for more than fifteen days, at which point you should do ghusl and pray.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Listening attentively to the khateeb on Friday is an obligation, and it is not permissible for the Muslims to be careless about that and fidget, talk or ignore the khutbah. The following ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning the virtues of listening attentively to the khutbah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Expiation for sins committed between this Friday and the previous Friday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whoever does ghusl, then comes to Jumu’ah, and prays what is decreed for him, then listens attentively until the khutbah is over, then prays with him (the imam), will be forgiven (his sins) between that and the next Jumu’ah, and three days more.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (857); a similar report was narrated from Salmaan al-Faarisi by al-Bukhaari (883).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – For every step he takes to the mosque, the reward of fasting and praying qiyaam for one year will be recorded for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Aws ibn Aws said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whoever washes his head and his body (ghusl) on Friday, then sets out early, is present at the beginning of the khutbah and is close (to the imam), then listens attentively, for every step he takes he will have the reward of fasting and praying qiyaam for one year.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (496) who said: it is a hasan hadeeth. It was classed as saheeh by al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan al-Kubra (3/227) and by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – The reward for praying Jumu’ah depends on listening attentively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you say to your companion, ‘Listen attentively’ on a Friday, when the imam is delivering the khutbah, then you have engaged in idle speech.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (934) and Muslim (851).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – The one who listens attentively will have two kafl of reward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib delivered a khutbah in Kufah and said in his khutbah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a man sits in a place where he can hear and see (the imam) and listens attentively and does not engage in idle speech or fidgeting, he will have two shares of reward. If he stays far away and sits in a place where he cannot hear but he listens attentively and does not engage in idle speech or fidgeting, he will have one share of reward. If he sits in a place where he can hear and see but he engages in idle speech or fidgets and does not listen attentively, then he will have one share of sin.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And at the end of that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood (1051) and classed as da’eef (weak) by al-Albaani.

In the airport, by mistake someone took his suitcase, and after communicating with the brother, the suitcase was returned to my friend, but the watch was not in the bag, as it had been stolen. We were not able to make contact again with the brother who had taken the suitcase by mistake, and the airline company will not compensate us for the price of the watch, because when my friend filled out the form to report missing items, he forgot to list the watch among the things that were missing.</p>\n<p>My question is:</p>\n<p>Should I pay my friend for the price of the watch?

      "question": "<p>My husband died a short while ago, and I am now in the `Iddah period, adhering to what is required during this time. A few days ago I spoke to the mother of one of my friends, and she said that for them in Turkey, the matter is somewhat different with regard to the woman in `Iddah, and that the only thing she must refrain from is getting married, and nothing else; as for other matters, such as putting on perfume, adorning herself, or going out for necessary purposes, they do not see anything wrong with that. She attributed this to the Hanafi Madhhab that the people in that country follow. Is what she said correct? Is there a difference of opinion among the jurists of the four Madhhabs concerning the `Iddah of a recently-widowed woman? I would like to know these details, not only for myself, but so that I can offer advice to that woman.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What this woman has told you, and attributed it to the Hanafi Madhhab (school of jurisprudence) – that the<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10670\" target=\"_blank\"> recently-widowed woman</a> only has to refrain from remarrying, and that anything other than that, such as adorning herself, is permissible for her and there is no blame on her if she does it – is not correct. The Hanafi jurists have stated that the recently-widowed woman must refrain from adorning herself.</p>\n<p>As-Samarqandi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Fuqaha’ (2/251): “Explanation of mourning: it means avoiding everything that women adorn themselves with, such as putting on perfume, wearing clothing that has been dyed with safflower or saffron, putting kohl on their eyes, using skin creams, combing their hair, wearing jewellery, dyeing their hair, and so on.”</p>\n<p>In Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq (3/34) by Az-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him), it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The recently-widowed woman observes mourning by refraining from adornment, perfume, kohl, skin cream (unless she has a legitimate excuse to use it), henna, and clothes dyed with safflower and saffron, if she is an adult and Muslim. That is because of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for someone who has died, except in the case of a husband, in which case <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/81139\" target=\"_blank\">she should observe mourning for him for four months and ten days</a> ; she should not wear kohl, or wear any dyed garment except `Asb (an unattractive Yemeni garment), or use perfume except when she purifies herself [following menses], a little Qust or Azfar [types of perfume].” &nbsp;(Al-Bukhari and Muslim).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: “The woman whose husband has died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower, or jewellery, or dye her hair, or use kohl.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i)</p>\n<p>The Hanafi jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) regard it as permissible <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/101546\" target=\"_blank\">for the recently-widowed woman to go out during the day if there is a need for her to go out</a> , such as earning a living, seeking medical treatment, and the like, on condition that she go home at night and spend the night at home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Ad-Daqa’iq wa Minhat Al-Khaliq (4/166):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/127974\" target=\"_blank\">The recently-widowed woman may go out</a> during the day and part of the night in order to earn a living… But it is not permissible for her to go out to visit other people or for any other purpose, whether by night or by day.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the only reason for which she is allowed to go out is if she has a need to in order to attend to her business or errands; once she does what she needs to, it is not permissible for her after that to spend time outside her house.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Kasaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the recently-widowed woman, she should not go out at night, but there is nothing wrong with her going out during the day to attend to her errands, such as if she needs to go out during the day to earn enough to cover her expenses, because she has no maintenance from her deceased husband; rather she is responsible for her own maintenance, so she needs to go out in order to earn that money. However, she should not go out at night, because there is no need for her to go out at night. This is in contrast to the recently-divorced woman, whose ex-husband is responsible for her maintenance, and thus she has no need to go out.\" (Bada’i` As-Sana’i` fi Tartib Ash-Shara’i`, 3/205)</p>\n<p>With regard to staying in the house and avoiding adornment during the `Iddah period, there is virtual consensus among the four Madhhabs.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Maalikis, Ibn `Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Kafi fi Fiqh Ahl Al-Madinah (2/622): “Mourning is obligatory for the one whose husband has died, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/31\" target=\"_blank\">until her `Iddah is complete</a> , either in terms of the requisite number of months or when her pregnancy ends.</p>\n<p>Mourning means <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/286707\" target=\"_blank\">avoiding everything with which women adorn themselves</a> , such as jewellery, cosmetics, kohl, dyeing the hair, or coloured or white garments worn for the purpose of adornment. ... As for jewellery, rings and so on, it is not permissible for the woman who is in mourning to wear them. The same applies to all kinds of perfume. If she has no choice but to use kohl, she should apply it at night and remove it during the day. She should not use any kind of perfumed oils. As for things that are not used for the purpose of beautification, there is nothing wrong with the woman who is in mourning using them.”</p>\n<p>In the case of the Shafa`is, Abu Ishaq Ash-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Tanbih fil Fiqh Ash-Shafa`i (1/201): “Mourning means avoiding adornment. So she (the woman who is in mourning) should not wear jewellery, put on perfume, dye her hair, style her hair, or use kohl made of antimony. If she needs to use kohl, she should apply it at night and wash it off during the day. She should not wear red or bright blue clothes. She should not go out of her house unnecessarily, and if there is a need for her to go out, it is not permissible to do that at night. It is permissible for the recently-widowed woman to go out to meet her needs during the day.”</p>\n<p>In the case of the Hanbalis, Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in `Umdat Al-Fiqh (1/107): Chapter on Mourning: “It (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13966\" target=\"_blank\">mourning</a> ) is obligatory for the woman whose husband has died, and it means avoiding adornment, perfume, kohl made of antimony, and the wearing of dyed clothes for the purpose of beautification .… She should stay at night in her house in which she is obliged to observe `Iddah and where she is living, if possible.”</p>\n<p>For more details, please see this category: <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/53/\" target=\"_blank\">Waiting Period of Widow or Divorcee</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Is_there_a_minimum_length_of_nifas_in_Islam\">Is there a minimum length of nifas in Islam?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Can_women_pray_and_fast_if_blood_stops_before_40_days_of_nifas\">Can women pray and fast if blood stops before 40 days of nifas?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_there_a_minimum_length_of_nifas_in_Islam\">Is there a minimum length of nifas in Islam?</span></h3>\n<p>The majority of scholars, including the four imams, are of the view that there is no minimum limit for nifas. Whenever a woman becomes pure from nifas, she has to do ghusl and pray and fast, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/140621\" target=\"_blank\">even if that is before forty days have passed since the birth</a> . Because no precise definition has been narrated in the Shari`ah with regard to the minimum length of nifas, so the matter should be based on experience, which shows that nifas may be very short or it may be long. (Ibn Qudamah in al-Mughni, 1/428)</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars narrated that there was consensus on this point. Al-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Successors and those who came after them are agreed that a woman in nifas should stop praying for forty days, unless she sees that she has become pure before that, in which case she should do ghusl and pray.” (Al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 2/541)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_women_pray_and_fast_if_blood_stops_before_40_days_of_nifas\"><strong>Can women pray and fast if blood stops before 40 days of nifas?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/195) was asked: is it permissible for a woman in nifas to pray, fast and do Hajj before forty days if she becomes pure (i.e., if the bleeding stops)?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Yes, it is permissible for her to fast, pray and do Hajj and ‘umrah, and it is permissible for her husband <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/43028\" target=\"_blank\">to have intercourse with her within forty days</a> , if she becomes pure. If she becomes pure after twenty days, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82868\" target=\"_blank\">she should do ghusl and pray and fast</a> , and she is permissible for her husband. The report from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-As which says that he regarded that as makruh is to be understood as meaning disliked but not forbidden; this is his ijtihad, but there is no evidence for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The correct view is that there is nothing wrong with that if the woman becomes pure before forty days. If the bleeding resumes within forty days, then the correct view is that she should regard it as nifas within the 40-day period, but her fasts, prayers and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21618\" target=\"_blank\">Hajj</a> at the time when she was pure are still valid and she does not have to repeat any of them, so long as they were done when she was pure.”</p>\n<p>It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (5/458):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If a woman in nifas sees that she has become pure before 40 days are over, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82344\" target=\"_blank\">then she should do ghusl</a> and pray and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/157006\" target=\"_blank\">fast</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36722\" target=\"_blank\">her husband may have intercourse with her</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee (10/155) was asked about a woman who gave birth seven days before Ramadan, then she became pure and fasted Ramadan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If the matter is as described and she fasted Ramadan at a time when she was pure, then her fast is valid and she does not have to make it up.”</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best</p>\n",

What we have found out about it is the following:</p>\n<p>Black Friday, which in the Arab world is sometimes called White Friday, is the day that comes immediately after Thanksgiving in the United States, and it is usually at the end of November every year. This day is regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.</p>\n<p>On this day, most stores offer sales and discounts, and open their doors as early as 4 AM, because of the huge discounts, and because most Christmas gifts are bought on that day. Large numbers of consumers gather outside major stores early on Friday, waiting for them to open, and when they open the crowds start pushing and shoving and running, each of them eager to acquire the biggest share of cut-price goods.</p>\n<p>The name of Black Friday dates back to the nineteenth century, as it was connected to the financial crisis of 1869 in the United States, which dealt a heavy blow to the American economy, to the extent that goods could not be sold and the buying and selling of goods ceased, which caused an economic catastrophe in America, from which it recovered by taking numerous measures, such as huge discounts in prices of products and goods, so that they could be sold instead of vendors being stuck with them, and so as to reduce losses as much as possible.</p>\n<p>From that day, it became a tradition in America for major stores, businesses and agencies to offer large discounts on their goods, that could be as high as 90% of their value, so that they could go back to their original price at the end of Black Friday or the month in which it occurs.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Why_is_it_called_Black_Friday\"><strong>Why is it called Black Friday?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>As for describing this day as ‘black’, that does not stem from dislike or superstition. Rather it was given this name for the first time in 1960 by the police in the city of Philadelphia, who gave it this name because of huge traffic jams, crowds and long lines in front of stores on this day, which was known for shopping. So the police department in Philadelphia dubbed this day Black Friday to describe the crowded chaos and traffic, both pedestrians and cars.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the word black is widely used with a specific meaning in the fields of business and accounting, as it is an indicator of profit and getting rid of stock in warehouses, whilst the colour red is indicative of loss and expenditure that exceeds earnings, or the piling up of trade goods and slowdown of business. The most likely reason [why it is called Black Friday] is that black ink was used to record profits and red ink was used to record losses in American ledgers and daily records of profits and losses. As a result of making large profits on that day, the ledgers were filled with black ink, then that Friday became known as Black Friday.” (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia-Black Friday</a>)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ruling_on_taking_advantage_of_reduced_prices_on_Black_Friday\"><strong>Ruling on taking advantage of reduced prices on Black Friday</strong></span></h3>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with buying items on Black Friday and taking advantage of the discounts and deals that are offered, even if this is connected to Thanksgiving or follows it, or these discounts are offered for people to buy Christmas gifts, so long as the purchaser buys permissible things and does not buy things for the purpose of celebrating Christmas, such as gifts and other things.</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/145676\" target=\"_blank\">145676</a> &nbsp;we explained that it is permissible to buy goods during the Christmas season, to take advantage of reductions in prices.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_Muslim_shopkeepers_single_out_Black_Friday_for_lowering_prices\"><strong>Can Muslim shopkeepers single out Black Friday for lowering prices?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>There is no such thing as Black Friday or White Friday for us. The Muslim should avoid <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45200\" target=\"_blank\">imitating and resembling the disbelievers</a> , and he should beware of extravagance and squandering. Sales and deals should not prompt him to waste his money on things that he does not need.</p>\n<p>Owners of shops should not single out Black Friday for reducing prices, because of what it involves <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/121554\" target=\"_blank\">imitating and resembling the disbelievers</a> . Rather he should treat this day like any other day, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud.)</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade resembling the disbelievers in customary matters, as Muslim (2077) narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw me wearing two garments that had been dyed with safflower and he said: “These are garments of the disbelievers; do not wear them.”</p>\n<p>And it was narrated from Hudhayfah ibn Al-Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him): I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Do not wear silk or brocade, do not drink from vessels of gold or silver, and do not eat from plates made with the same, for they are for them in this world and for us in the hereafter.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5426 and Muslim, 2967)</p>\n<p>Ahmad (22283) narrated that Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to some old men of the Ansar whose beards were white, and said: “O Ansar, dye your beards red and yellow; be different from the People of the Book.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, the People of the Book wear trousers and they do not wear the Izar (waist wrapper, lower garment). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Wear trousers and Izars, and be different from the People of the Book.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, the People of the Book wear Khuffs and do not wear sandals. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Wear Khuffs and sandals, and be different from the People of the Book.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, the People of the Book cut short their beards and let their moustaches grow. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Trim your moustaches and let your beards grow, and be different from the People of the Book.”</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (2659) narrated from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb (may Allah be pleased with him), from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who imitates people other than us. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21694\" target=\"_blank\">Do not imitate the Jews or the Christians</a> , for the greeting of the Jews is to gesture with the fingers and the greeting of the Christians is to gesture with the palm of the hand.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>If the disbelievers look forward to Black Friday every year, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7842\" target=\"_blank\">they single it out for discounts</a> and adverts and call it by a special name, we have no right to imitate them in that when we are buying and selling, or to single out this day for reducing prices on goods in our stores. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22862\" target=\"_blank\">However, if a shopper comes across these discounts</a> , he may buy whatever he needs, as explained above.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>What the Muslim must do is be a good example of trustworthiness, fulfilling covwnants and good attitude. The fact that Muslims had these qualities was a cause of many kuffaar entering Islam when they saw the beauties of Islam and the good attitude and conduct of its people.</p>\n<p>Treachery and betrayal are forbidden in Islam, whether that is with a Muslim or a kaafir.

Abu Dawud (2278) narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/93845\" target=\"_blank\">maternal aunt</a> is of the same status as the mother.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was said that what is meant is that she is of the same status as the mother with regard to being entitled to custody, because the hadith was narrated concerning that.&nbsp;(Fath al-Bari, 7 /506)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also said that her status is equivalent to that of the mother with regard to custody and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi said in al-Kabair: “That is, with regard to showing kindness, honouring, and upholding ties of kinship with her.” (Sharh Bulugh al-Maram by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 5/203)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rights_of_maternal_aunt_in_Islam\">Rights of maternal aunt in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>The second meaning is supported by the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1904) from Ibn ‘Umar, according to which a man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I have committed a grave sin; can I repent? He said: “Do you have a mother?” He said: No. He said: “Do you have a maternal aunt?” He said: Yes. He said: “Then treat her kindly.”&nbsp;(Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Targhib, 2504) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates that honouring one’s maternal aunt and treating her kindly come under the heading of virtuous deeds and acts that expiate sins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (4970) narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: O Messenger of Allah, all my friends have a kunyah. He said: “Call yourself by the name of your son ‘Abdullah” – meaning the son of her sister. Musaddad said: ‘Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr. He said: So she was known by the kunyah of Umm ‘Abdullah. He was ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, the son of her sister Asma (may Allah be pleased with them all).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith confirms what is mentioned above, that the maternal aunt is of the same status as the mother.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the Muslim should treat his maternal aunt in a kind manner, just as he treats his mother.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_your_maternal_aunt_the_maternal_aunt_of_your_descendants\">Is your maternal aunt the maternal aunt of your descendants?</span></h3>\n<p>A <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/34791\" target=\"_blank\">person’s maternal aunt</a> – or his paternal aunt – is a maternal aunt to him and to all of his descendants, or a paternal aunt to him and all of his descendants.

If you are not travelling, then when you have done the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’, join the imam in Tarawih. It does not matter if the intentions of the imam and of the person praying behind him are different; in other words, it is permissible for the imam to intend to offer an optional prayer and for the person praying behind him to intend to offer the obligatory prayer. This is what was stated by Imam Ahmad, that it is permissible for a person to pray `Isha’ behind someone who is praying Tarawih. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 4/66).</p>\n<p>But what he prays – in both cases – is not regarded as coming under the heading of praying Qiyam [voluntary prayers at night], because Tarawih prayer is separate in and of itself, and cannot be put together with the Sunnah of `Isha’ with one intention – and this applies even more so to the obligatory prayer – rather he should intend to pray the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’ on its own, and his Qiyam will be lacking those two Rak`ahs.</p>\n<p>Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Sunnah prayer of `Isha’ is a confirmed Sunnah, and is two Rak`ahs. The Sunnah is to offer this prayer before Tarawih, because it is a separate Sunnah, and Tarawih is a separate Sunnah.

This is not included in the advice that some scholars give that it is not allowed to offer optional prayer in the break in Tarawih, because this prayer is a regular Sunnah and is not optional in an absolute, unqualified sense.</li>\n<li>Or he may pray the first two Rak`ahs of Tarawih with the intention of praying the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See these answers for more information: (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/128164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">128164</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/37829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">37829</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/189426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">189426</a>)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us the eight categories of people to whom zakah may be given in His holy Book. Are the following activities regarded as coming under the categories of zakah: distributing food hampers, distributing blankets in the winter, hooking up water supply to the houses of poor people, building wooden roofs for them, providing trousseaux for brides who are orphans or poor, and providing medical aid for the sick – on condition that the zakah funds are given to a trustworthy charity, and the charity takes charge of these activities? Please note that the charity checks up on cases before offering the help to them. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good, as to whether the things mentioned above come under the categories of zakah or not. If I give zakah in this manner, will I have given it in the form of wealth as is required of me? Or is giving the zakah on one’s wealth in the form of money not obligatory at all?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is required in the case of zakah on one’s wealth is that it should be given in the form of money, and it is not permissible to give it in the form of items or food. It is obligatory for the one who is giving zakah to hand over the zakah money to those who are entitled to it, but after that he does not have any say in how the poor person is to dispose of this money or to tell him how to spend it in the was that will bring him most benefit according to his view; rather he should give the money to a poor person who is deserving of it and who knows better what he needs and what is in his best interests than anyone else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well-known that the person can get what he wants by means of money, unlike specific items that he may or may not need, and he may be compelled to sell it for a cheap price in order to make use of its price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>Is it permissible to turn the zakah money into specific items, such as food or other things, and distribute it to the poor?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That is not permissible; zakah must be given in cash.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri (41/12)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>zakah on money must be given in cash; it cannot be given in the form of other items, unless the poor person made a request of you and said: If you receive money for me, then buy me such and such with it. In that case there is nothing wrong with it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo‘ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/303)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If there is a specific poor person who needs either medicine or food, or similar needs, and it is known that if zakah is given to him in the form of cash it will clearly be detrimental, or if his interests dictate that that poor person should not be given cash, then in this case some of the scholars regard it as permissible to give him zakah in the form of specific items instead of cash. For example, if the poor person is insane or feebleminded, and does not handle money well, or he is foolish and will waste money, or he is an evildoer who will spend the money on that which is of no benefit, then he and his dependents will remain in need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam said:</p>\n<p>Giving items of equivalent value when there is no need and no obvious interest to be served is not allowed… Because if it were made permissible to give items of equivalent value, then the giver may give bad quality items or the evaluation may not be correct. zakah is intended to help the poor, and the zakah is connected to the amount of wealth one owns and its type. However, with regard to giving items of equivalent value when there is a need for that or an interest to be served thereby, or to achieve fairness, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (25/82)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz said in al-Fatawa (14/253):</p>\n<p>It is permissible to give, instead of cash, goods such as fabric, food and the like, if it is thought that the interests of the recipients of zakah may be best served in that manner, so long as what is given is evaluated correctly. For example, if the poor person is insane, feebleminded, foolish or immature, and there is the fear that he may mess about with the cash, and his interests are best served by giving him food or clothing equal in value to the amount of money due to him, bought with zakah funds, that he can benefit from. All of this is according to the most correct scholarly opinion. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Better than that is to buy on behalf of the poor (with their consent) the things that they need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad as-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If the people of this household are poor, but if we give them cash they will mishandle it by buying luxuries and things that are of no benefit, then if we buy necessities for them and give them to them, is that permissible?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The well-known view among the scholars is that this is not permissible, i.e. it is not permissible for the individual to buy items with his zakah and give them instead of cash. They said: That is because this cash is more beneficial to the poor, because they can spend the cash however they wish, unlike specific items for which they may have no need, in which case they would sell them for a lower price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there is an alternative: if you are afraid that if you give zakah to this household they will spend it on things that are not necessary, then you may say to the head of the household – whether that is the father or the mother or the brother or the paternal uncle – you can say to him: I have zakah to give; what items do you need so that I can buy them for you and send them to you?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you do it in this way, then it is permissible, and the zakah will be given appropriately.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/question no. 643)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conclusion: giving zakah in the form of items and goods instead of cash is not permissible, unless there is a need for that and an interest to be served thereby.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The limits on a man’s lying to his wife and vice versa",
      "question": "<p>I know that lying is permissible in three situations: lying to one’s wife, lying for the purpose of bringing about reconciliation, and lying to the enemy (in war). Isn’t that so? But what are the limits on a man’s lying to his wife?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is a concession allowing one to tell lies in three situations, as is mentioned in the hadith narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1939) and Abu Dawud (4921) from Asma’ bint Yazid (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Lying is not permitted except in three cases: a man’s speaking to his wife to make her happy; lying at times of war; and lying in order to reconcile between people.” Al-Albani classed the hadith as authentic in <em>Sahih at-Tirmidhi</em>.</p>\n<p>Muslim (2065) narrated from Umm Kulthum bint `Uqbah ibn Abu Mu`ayt (may Allah be pleased with her) that she heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saying: “He is not a liar who reconciles between people and conveys something good or says something good.” Ibn Shihab said: I did not hear of any concession being granted concerning anything that people call lies except in three cases: War, reconciling among people, and what a man says to his wife or a woman says to her husband.</p>\n<p>What is meant by telling lies between spouses is lying when expressing affection and love for the purpose of maintaining harmony and keeping the family together, such as the husband saying to his wife: You are dear to me, or: No one is dearer to me than you, or: You are the most beautiful of women in my eyes, and so on. It does not mean the kind of lying that leads to undermining rights or evasion of duties and so on.</p>\n<p>Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Sharh as-Sunnah</em> (13/119): Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi said: These are issues in which a man may have to exaggerate in his words and go beyond what is strictly true, for the purpose of maintaining peace and warding off harm. A similar concession is granted in some situations, allowing something that is wrong for the sake of some hoped-for benefit. So lying when seeking to reconcile between two people means telling one of them that the other said something good about him, even if he did not hear him say that, intending thereby to bring about reconciliation. And lying in the case of war means pretending to be strong, and saying things that will encourage and inspire one’s companions and cause trouble to the enemy. It is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “War is deceit.”</p>\n<p>What is meant by a man’s lying to his wife is making promises to her and raising her hopes, and showing more love to her than he really feels, in order to maintain a good relationship with her and make her behave well with him. And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah said: If a man apologizes to another man, saying nice things that are not accurate in order to please him, he is not a liar who is distorting the facts: “He is not a liar who reconciles between people.” He said: His reconciling between himself and another man is more important than his reconciling between people.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that at the time of `Umar, a man said to his wife: I adjure you by Allah, do you love me? She said: As you have adjured me by Allah, then no. He went to `Umar, who sent for her and said: Are you the one who said to your husband: I do not love you? She said: O Amir al-Mu’minin, he adjured me by Allah; should I lie to him? He said: Yes, you should lie to him; not all marriages are built on love, but people get along by virtue of Islam and ties of kinship. End quote.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Sharh Muslim</em>: As for a man’s lying to his wife and her lying to him, what is meant is showing affection, making promises that are not binding, and so on. As for tricking one another in order to withhold their dues, or take that to which they have no right, that is prohibited according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. And Allah knows best. End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Al-Fat-h</em>: [The scholars] are unanimously agreed that what is meant by lying with regard to a wife and husband is lying in matters that do not lead to waiving of duties or acquiring that to which he or she has no right. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin</em> (1/1790): Serving an interest also includes a man’s talking to his wife and a woman’s talking to her husband in ways that increase harmony and strengthen the bond between them, such as if he says to her: You are dear to me, you are dearer to me than all women, and the like, even if he is lying, but it is for the sake of creating affection, and it serves an interest. End quote.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Will the Sunnah of the `aqiqah be fulfilled by slaughtering one sheep for a boy?",
      "question": "<p>Allah has blessed me with a boy, who is now two years old, but I did not offer `aqiqah for him. Now Allah has blessed me with another boy, and I want to offer `aqiqah for both boys. If I slaughter one sheep for each boy, will I have fulfilled the Sunnah, or must I offer teo sheep for each boy in order to fulfil the Sunnah? If I slaughter one sheep for each boy now, can I slaughter one sheep for each boy later on, so that two sheep will have been slaughtered for each boy? I hope to do that when my situation becomes easier, by Allah’s grace. Or is the best and correct thing to slaughter two sheep on behalf of one of them now, and not offer `aqiqah for the other until things become easier, by Allah’s grace? What is the difference between what is good enough and fulfilling the Sunnah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Offering the `aqiqah is a confirmed Sunnah, but there is no sin one the one who does not do it, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (2842) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: &nbsp;“If anyone has a child born to him and wishes to offer a sacrifice on its behalf, he may offer two sheep of similar type for a boy and one for a girl.” Shaykh al-Albani classed it as authentic (hasan) in <em>Sahih Abi Dawud</em>.</p>\n<p>Thus the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) connected the matter to what the individual wanted to do; this indicates that it is recommended (mustahabb), but not obligatory. See: <em>Tuhfat al-Mawdud</em>, p. 157.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The Sunnah is to offer two sheep on behalf of a male child and one sheep on behalf of a female, because of the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1516) and an-Nasa’i (4217) from Umm Karaz, according to which she asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about the `aqiqah, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On behalf of a boy two sheep and on behalf of a girl one sheep.” Classed as authentic by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Irwa’ al-Ghalil</em>, 4/391.</p>\n<p>Ash-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Sunnah is to sacrifice two sheep on behalf of a boy and one sheep on behalf of a girl, because of the report narrated by Umm Karaz… and because and because the purpose is to express joy at the birth of the child, and the joy at the birth of a boy is greater, so the sacrifice offered on his behalf is greater. But if one sheep is slaughtered on behalf of each of them, that is permissible, because of the report narrated by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sacrificed one ram each on behalf of al-Hasan and al-Husayn (peace be upon them)… End quote.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: The Sunnah is to sacrifice two sheep on behalf of a boy and one sheep on behalf of a girl, but if a person slaughters one sheep on behalf of a boy, then he has fulfilled the basic requirement of the Sunnah, because of what the author mentioned.(<em>Sharh al-Muhadhdhab</em>, 8/409).</p>\n<p>In <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em> (30/280), it says: The Shafa`is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is recommended to offer as `aqiqah for a male two sheep of similar type, and for a female one sheep, because of the hadith of `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in which she said that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed them to offer two sheep of similar type for a boy and one sheep for a girl.</p>\n<p>It is permissible to offer one sheep as `aqiqah for a boy, because of the hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>The Hanafis and Malikis are of the view that one sheep each may be offered as `aqiqah for a boy and a girl. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to do that… End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person can only afford one sheep, that is sufficient and fulfils the purpose. But if Allah has made him well off, then two sheep is better.(<em>Ash-Sharh al-Mumti`</em>, 7/492).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Once it has become clear that the basic requirement of Sunnah may be fulfilled by slaughtering one sheep on behalf of a boy, then if someone has two boys, for example, and he only has two sheep, then what is more appropriate to suggest is that he should slaughter one sheep on behalf of each boy, and thus he will have fulfilled the basic requirement of the Sunnah, and done as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did. Missing out on what is best for each of them is less serious than missing out on the basic requirement of the Sunnah for one of them, especially as some of the scholars say that offering the `aqiqah is obligatory. So discharging one’s duty with regard to the `aqiqah for two boys is more appropriate than discharging it for one of them, and leaving the other unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that: he offered one sheep each as `aqiqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn.</p>\n<p>Then if a person becomes better off after that, and he wants to offer another sheep in addition to the one that he had already slaughtered, then we hope that that will benefit him, in sha Allah, and that this will perfect the `aqiqah that he had previously offered.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: If he slaughters one sheep today, and he slaughters the second a few days later, there is nothing wrong with that, and it is not essential that the two sheep should both be slaughtered at the same time.(<em>Al-Muntawa min Fatawa al-Fawzan)</em>.</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The difference between doing what is sufficient and doing something as prescribed in the Sunnah is that there is more goodness in doing it as prescribed in the Sunnah than in doing what is merely sufficient. An example is if a person does wudu’ and washes each part once; his wudu’ is valid and he does not have to repeat it, but if he washes each part three times, then he will have done what is sufficient and will also have a great reward for doing what is in accordance with the&nbsp; Sunnah. Another example is someone who fasts on the tenth day of Muharram but does not fast a day before or a day after. His deed is acceptable and he will be rewarded for it, but he is not like one who fasts one day before or after, for the latter will have done what is sufficient and more, by acting in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who encouraged us to fast a day before or a day after.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the minimum period of purity (Tuhr)? My menstrual cycle is not regular. Sometimes I do not have a period for months, sometimes it comes on time. I did ghusl following my period ten days ago, and during this time there was some light yellow spotting from time to time, but after ten days it increased and became a new period, with cramps (period pains) and the usual colour of menstrual blood.

      "title": "The myth that visiting the grave of ‘Ali equals seventy Hajj",
      "question": "<p>Does visiting the graves of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), al-Husayn, al-‘Abbaas and others equal seventy pilgrimages to the Sacred House of Allaah? Did the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “Whoever visits the members of my household (ahl bayti) after I die will have seventy Hajj recorded for him”? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Visiting graves is a Sunnah which provides a lesson and a reminder. If the graves are those of Muslims, one should make du’aa’ for them… The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves and make du’aa’ for the deceased, as did his companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter.” He used to teach his companions, when they visited graves, to say, “Al-salaamu ‘alayum ahl al-diyaar min al-mu’mineen wa’l-muslimeen, wa innaa in sha Allaah bikum laahiqoon. Nas’al Allaaha lana wa lakum al-‘aafiyah (Peace be upon you O inhabitants of the dwellings, believers and Muslims. If Allaah wills, we shall join you soon. We ask Allaah to keep us and you safe and sound.).” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah: “Yarham Allaah al-mustaqdimeena minna wa’l-musta’khireen (may Allaah have mercy on those of us who went first and those who will join them afterward).” According to the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas “yaghfir Allaah lana wa lakum, antum salafuna wa nahnu fi’l-athr (May Allaah forgive us and you. You are our predecessors and we are following in your footsteps).” Making du’aa’ for them in these or similar words is all good. Visiting them brings a reminder and a lesson to the believer to prepare for what has befallen them, i.e., death, for what happened to them will happen to him too. So let him make preparations and strive to obey Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and keep away from that which Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden. Let him repent from his previous shortcomings. This is how the believer is to benefit from visiting graves. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what is mentioned (in the question) about visiting the graves of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), al-Hasan, al-Husayn and others being equivalent to seventy Hajj – this is a lie and is falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it has no basis. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the best of all, is not equivalent to one Hajj; this visit has its status and virtues, but it is not equivalent to Hajj, so how about visits to anyone else’s grave? This is a lie, as is the phrase “Whoever visits the members of my household (ahl bayti) after I die will have seventy Hajj recorded for him.” All of this has no basis at all and all of it is false. All of it is lies made up by the liars. The believer has to beware of these fabricated things that have been falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is Sunnah to visit the graves whether they are graves of the members of his household (Ahl al-Bayt) or other Muslims; (it is Sunnah) to visit them, make du’aa’ for them, pray for mercy for them and then leave. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If they are the graves of kaafirs, they may be visited for the purpose of learning a lesson and being reminded, without making du’aa’ for them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) visited his mother’s grave, but his Lord forbade him to pray for forgiveness for her. He visited her grave for the purpose of the lesson and reminder, but he did not pray for forgiveness for her. This applies to all other graves – graves of kaafirs – if a believer visits them for the purpose of the lesson and reminder, there is nothing wrong with that, but he should not greet them with salaams or pray for forgiveness for them, because they do not deserve that.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I would like to know whether “skin sewing” comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah, which is haraam and with which Iblees threatened the slaves of Allah. In brief, this refers to a form of adornment in which a needle with thread is passed beneath the transparent outer layers of dead skin on the hands and feet only. And we do not pass a needle any deeper than that, into the layers of the skin. This method means that the needle does not cause any sensation of pain or leave any marks in the skin at all after sewing with the needle. It is possible to remove the needle from the skin on the same day, and it is not permanent at all, hence I do not regard it as being like tattoos or plucking the eyebrows in any way  like the haraam things mentioned above. I hope that you can clarify this matter.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We have not come across this type of adornment except in the following clip:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ3p490mHog\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ3p490mHog</a></p>\n<p>If the matter is as it appears to us to be, and as you mentioned in your question, that it involves inserting the needle into the dead layer of skin and using a thread that is not permanent, rather it is removed within one or two days, then what appears to be the case is that this does not come under the heading of tattooing and there does not seem to be any reason to disallow it, if there is no risk of harm.</p>\n<p>We have previously stated that it is permissible to use temporary tattoos, subject to certain guidelines, as in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/99629\" target=\"_blank\">99629</a>. This is no different to that in terms of ruling.</p>\n<p>But we should pay attention to an important matter having to do with this sewing, which is that it is done in parts of the body that are washed when doing wudoo’ and purifying oneself. Therefore what appears to be the case, from what we have seen, is that this prevents the water from reaching the skin and makes it not possible to wash the part of the body that must be washed when doing wudoo’ or ghusl.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, then it is not permissible to do this in the places that must be washed in wudoo’, because it makes no sense to do this and then remove it the time of each prayer.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

She replied that she had. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: \"By the Lord of the Ka'bah! Go back to Ali and tell him that you are prepared to rub your nose in dust in order to keep him happy.

In some cases it is permissible, in order for the woman to ward off harm from herself or her faith.</p>\n<p>An example of that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (5364) and Muslim (1714) from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which Hind bint ‘Utbah said: O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a stingy man and he does not give me enough maintenance for myself and my children, except what I take from him without his knowledge. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children, on a reasonable basis.”</p>\n<p>In the case of Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) feared that she would be put to trial, he listened to her complaint.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (3729) and Muslim (2449) narrated that al-Miswar ibn Makhramah said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib proposed to the daughter of Abu Jahl, and he was already married to Faatimah the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When Faatimah heard of that she came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Your people are saying that you do not get angry for the sake of your daughters, and ‘Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl.</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and I heard him when he recited the shahadah, then he said: “I gave a daughter of mine in marriage to Abu’l-‘As ibn ar-Rabi‘, and when he spoke he told me the truth. Fatimah bint Muhammad is a part of me, and I do not like to see her upset. By Allah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah and the daughter of the enemy of Allah will not be joined together as wives of one man.” So ‘Ali abandoned that proposal.</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by al-Bukhari (3110) and Muslim (2449) from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, he said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib proposed marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl (to be a co-wife) to Fatimah, and I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressing the people concerning that, on this minbar of his, and I was an adolescent at that time. He said: “Fatimah is part of me, and I fear lest she be put to trial with regard to her religious commitment.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“and I fear lest she be put to trial with regard to her religious commitment” means: she will not be able to put up with jealousy, so if she became angry, she would treat her husband in a way that is not befitting to her commitment to Islam [because it would be contrary to Islamic teachings].\"(<em>Fath al-Bari</em>&nbsp; 9/329).</p>\n<p>With regard to problems that the Muslim woman is able to resolve through dialogue with her husband and with patience, it is more appropriate in this case for her not to complain.</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>The questioner is saying: I have a sister who is married, and she has problems with her husband and his family. When she comes to visit us, she tells us what is happening to her and her children, and she cries a great deal, because she is being mistreated a great deal. We advise her to be patient, but I wonder: does she have the right to do that when she is with us? May Allah reward you with good, what do you advise us to do?</p>\n<p>Answer: we advise her to be patient, if her husband is a good man; we advise her to be patient and not complain to you and not tell you anything. Rather that should be between her and her husband. If she is able to ask his father, older brother or maternal or paternal uncle, if they are good, to advise him, if there is a need to do that, then there is nothing wrong with it. But whenever it is possible for her to solve her problems between her and him by herself, that is more appropriate. She should use good manners and good words, and show kindness, until he calms down, so that he can respond to her request, and she should not be harsh and tough, and should not forsake him and the like. Rather she should handle matters wisely, with good words and a kind approach.</p>\n<p>The husband should fear Allah and treat his wife kindly, using good words and a gentle approach. Each of them should strive to show kindness and goodness, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And live with them in kindness}&nbsp;[An-Nisa’ 4:19]</p>\n<p>{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable}&nbsp;[Al-Baqarah 2:228].\"(<em>Nur ‘ala ad-Darb&nbsp;</em>21/234).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

But she must hasten to make up the fasts that she missed because when a woman reaches the age of puberty, she becomes accountable and she must make up the fasts that she missed during the time when she was accountable. She must strive to work out how many days she missed after she reached puberty, and hasten to make them up so there will no longer be any sin on her.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>The scholars have said that it is permissible to buy shares that are basically halaal and are put in the riba-based banks, on the condition that 15% of the profit is paid in the public interest. <br />\n<br />\nMy question is: <br />\n<br />\nIs it permissible to give that to relatives to benefit from it, such as one’s mother or siblings?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Buying shares in companies and organizations is permissible     on the condition that they are trading in permissible goods and are not     engaging in haraam transactions. One of the greatest of haraam actions is     consuming riba. If one of these two conditions is broken, and the company is     dealing in haraam things or is manufacturing haraam things, or it is dealing     in riba, then buying shares is haraam and one should avoid that and find     something permissible. The fact that a certain percentage of the profits is     paid (in charity) does not make it permissible to buy those shares or make     that profit halaal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have     mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying shares in companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Buying shares in companies is subject to further discussion,     because we have heard that they put their money in foreign banks, or     quasi-foreign banks, and take interest on it, which is a kind of riba. If     this is true then buying shares in them is haraam and is a major sin,     because riba is one of the worst of major sins. But if it is free of this     then buying shares is halaal, so long as there is nothing else involved that     is haraam according to sharee’ah. End quote.</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen     (18/question no. 119).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is it permissible to buy shares in companies and     organizations that offer their shares to the public at a time when we are     uncertain as to whether these companies and organizations engage in riba in     their dealings and we are not sure about that. Please note that we cannot be     sure about that, but it is what we have heard from other people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to companies and organizations that do not engage     in riba or deal in haraam things, it is permissible to buy shares in them,     but as for those that engage in riba or any haraam things, it is haraam to     buy shares in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If there is uncertainty about any company, then it is safer     not to buy shares in them, based on the words of the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Leave that which makes you doubt for that     which does not make you doubt.” And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever avoids doubtful things has discharged his     duty and protected his religious commitment and honour.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd     al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn     Qa’ood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’ (14/310-311)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/21127\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">21127</a> we quoted the fatwa of     the Standing Committee which states the ruling on buying shares in     charitable organizations, agriculture companies, banks, insurance companies     and petroleum companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/8590\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">8590</a> you will find the ruling     on dealing in permissible shares and a warning against haraam shares.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the share holder gets haraam profits from his shares, he     must – after taking out his share and keeping it – get rid of the money that     is surplus to his capital. He can spend it on charitable causes so long as     he does not benefit from that in any way or relieve himself of some     obligation or ward off some harm or wrongdoing from himself.

The matter may be discussed further, as follows:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Understanding_Pregnancy_in_Islam_A_Time_of_Hardship\">Understanding Pregnancy in Islam: A Time of Hardship</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/161204\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pregnancy is a time of exhaustion and weakness</a> . That is described in the Quran, where Allah, may He be Glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship.} [Luqman 31:14]</p>\n<p>Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Exhaustion upon exhaustion. `Ata’ (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Weakness upon weakness. (End quote from Tafsir Al-Quran Al-`Athim. 6/336)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Islamic_Duty_to_Ease_Hardship_during_Pregnancy\">The Islamic Duty to Ease Hardship during Pregnancy</span></h3>\n<p>It is well known that all duties prescribed in Islam are to be within the limits of what one is able to do. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.} [Al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Husbands_Role_Kindness_and_Support_for_a_Pregnant_Wife\">Husband's Role: Kindness and Support for a Pregnant Wife</span></h3>\n<p>Although serving the husband is a duty enjoined by Islam, it is also limited to that which the woman is able to do. So it is not permissible for the husband to burden his wife with that which she is unable to bear, by combining the burdens of life, working outside the home and bearing children.</p>\n<p>As pregnancy is a reason for which some duties are waived, such as fasting, then it is more appropriate that it should be a reason for it being obligatory for the husband to take care of his wife and show compassion towards her with regard to her serving him and taking care of the house.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Balance_of_Responsibilities_in_Pregnancy\">The Balance of Responsibilities in Pregnancy</span></h3>\n<p>Although the basic Islamic principle on which the scholars unanimously agreed is that “hardship dictates that things should be made easier”, and there is corroborating evidence that confirms that, it is also essential that the wife’s serving of her husband should not lead to extraordinary hardship or a great deal of hardship. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, does not want duties to cause undue hardship to people as He, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says: (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.} [Al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>{Allah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you; and man was created weak} [An-Nisa 4:28]</p>\n<p>{Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour on you that you may be thankful.” [Al-Maidah 5:6]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Islamic_Encouragement_for_a_Peaceful_Home_Environment\">Islamic Encouragement for a Peaceful Home Environment</span></h3>\n<p>If the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined kindness to slaves and servants, and he forbade their masters to burden them with anything that would be too difficult for them, unless they help them with it — “(They are) your brothers and servants whom Allah has placed under your control, so whoever has his brother under his control, let him feed him what he eats and clothe him with what he wears, and do not burden him with more than he can bear. And do not burden them with more than they can bear, and if you do that, then help them” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2545 and Muslim, 1661) — then how about a man’s wife and life companion?!</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (my Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, I emphasize the rights of the two weak ones: orphans and women.” (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (15/416); Muassasat Ar-Risalah edn., The editors said: Its chain of narration is strong.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Practical_Advice_for_couples_during_Pregnancy\">Practical Advice for couples during Pregnancy</span></h3>\n<p>At the end of that answer, we advise the wife to look after her house as much as possible and to provide comfort for everyone in it, and to do her utmost to create an atmosphere of peace and tranquillity, and everything that is needed.</p>\n<p>And she should ask Allah, may He be Exalted, to help her with that. We hope that Allah, may He be Exalted, will honour her with kind treatment from her husband and his help if she tries sincerely for the sake of Allah and does not fall short or neglect anything.</p>\n<p>We do not think that you should go to your mother’s house to eat there and leave your husband; rather you should stay with your husband. If you feel energetic and strong, then serve him and meet his needs. All women get pregnant as you are pregnant; do you see women leaving their houses and forsaking their husbands?</p>\n<p>Although we excuse you because of your situation and we would remind your husband of your rights, it is not appropriate for you to take that as an excuse to omit to do whatever you can of serving him and taking care of him.</p>\n<p>We understand that you are working outside the home during your pregnancy; there is no doubt that serving your husband and taking care of your health takes precedence over that. If you are not able to combine work and taking care of your house, then take leave from your work and focus on your house and husband during this period.</p>\n<p>If that is not possible because of your circumstances, then hire someone to help you with the housework and use some of your salary to help you with that.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to set your affairs straight and to help you to treat your husband kindly and to reconcile between you.</p>\n<p>To learn more, review these answers:&nbsp;(<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">69960</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/88353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">88353</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9602</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10680</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1704</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/191975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">191975</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">111964</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/214222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">214222</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/119767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">119767</a>)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The meaning of enslavement in Islam",
      "question": "<p>Can you please clarify the subject of Slaves in Islam. In The Koran, there are many mentions of this term in particular the instance where man is the slave to his Master Allah, which I fully understand and agree. But in many instances the Koran cites where one man/woman is the slave of another man/woman. In what context has Allah made this permissible, if it is permissible. Your clarification on this subject would be most grateful.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The enslavement of the Muslim to Allaah, may He be glorified, is what He had commanded in His Book and is the Message with which He sent the Messengers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah)” [al-Nahl 16:36].</p>\n<p>The word ‘Uboodiyyah (enslavement) in Arabic comes from the word Ta’beed (enthrallment, subjugation). The phrase ‘abbadtu’l-tareeq means “I made the way smooth and easy to walk on.” The enslavement of the slave to Allaah has two meanings, one general and one specific. If by “slave” I mean al-mu’abbad, i.e., one who is subjugated, this is the general meaning which includes every created thing in the both the higher and the lower realms, sentient and otherwise, animate and inanimate, moving and stationary, kaafir and mu’min, righteous and immoral, for every creature is subjugated by Allaah and is subject to His control, and for each of them there is a limit at which it stops.</p>\n<p>If by “slave” I mean al-‘aabid, one who worships Allaah and obeys His commands, this meaning applies specifically to the believers to the exclusion of the kaafireen, because the believers are the true slaves of Allaah who attribute Lordship and Divinity to Him Alone and recognize Him by His Names and Attributes, and do not associate anything with Him. As Allaah says in the story of Iblees (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“[Iblees (Satan)] said: ‘O my Lord! Because You misled me, I shall indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I shall mislead them all. Except Your chosen, (guided) slaves among them.’&nbsp;(Allaah) said: ‘This is the Way which will lead straight to Me. Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the Ghaawoon (Mushrikoon and those who go astray, criminals, polytheists, and evildoers).’” [al-Hijr 15:39-42]</p>\n<p>With regard to the ‘ibaadah (worship) which Allaah enjoins upon us, this is a word which includes everything that Allaah loves and is pleased with of words and deeds, both open and hidden, and excludes anything that may cancel that out. This definition includes the Shahaadatayn, Salaah, Hajj, fasting, jihaad for the sake of Allaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and believing in Allaah, the angels, the Messengers and the Last Day. The basis for this worship is purity of intention, so that the aim of the worshipper is to seek the Face of Allaah, may He be glorified, and the Home of the Hereafter. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And Al-Muttaqûn (the pious) will be far removed from it (Hell). He who spends his wealth for increase in self-purification, And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back, Except to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High. He surely, will be pleased (when he will enter Paradise).” [al-Layl 92:17-21]</p>\n<p>So purity of intention is essential, as is sincerity, so that the believer strives to follow what Allaah has commanded and to avoid what He has forbidden, prepares himself for the Meeting with Allaah (may He be exalted), gives up feeling helpless and lazy, and refrains from following his own desires, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).” [al-Tawbah 9:119]</p>\n<p>It is also essential to follow the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so the worshipper should worship Allaah in accordance with what He has prescribed and not in accordance with what created beings desire or innovate. This is the aim of following the Prophet who was sent from Allaah, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Purity of intention, sincerity and following the Messenger are all essential. Once these matters are understood, then it will be clear to us that everything that goes against these essentials is in fact enslavement to people. So showing off is a form of enslavement to people; Shirk is a form of enslavement to people; neglecting Allaah’s commands and angering the Lord in order to earn people’s approval is a form of enslavement to people. Everyone who puts following his own desires before obeying his Lord has gone beyond the bounds of ‘Uboodiyyah (enslavement to Allaah) and has deviated from the Straight Path. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Doomed is the slave of the dinar, doomed is the slave of the dirham, doomed is the slave of fine cloth and doomed is the slave of velvet. If he is given something he is pleased and if he is denied, he is angry. Doomed is he!

      "title": "Is it permissible to curse those who commit sin?",
      "question": "<p>Among us, if one man curses another and the curse receives no response because he does not deserve that, does it come back on the first man or not? Is it permissible to curse a woman on the grounds that she is not wearing hijab?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Cursing is not one of the attributes of the believer who has     attained perfect faith. It was narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad     and Imam al-Tirmidhi in his Jaami’ from ‘Alqamah that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn     Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer is not a     slanderer, one who curses a great deal, one who indulges in obscenity or who     in engages in foul talk.” Al-Tirmidhi said: It is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth.     And it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from Thaabit ibn al-Dahhaak that     the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursing     a believer is like killing him.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on this, it is not permissible for a believer to curse     anyone among his Muslim brothers except those whom Allaah cursed in His Book     or whom the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     cursed. It is not permissible to curse one who commits a sin because of his     or her sin, such as a woman who is not wearing hijab and the like. Rather     the Muslim should advise her and encourage her to wear hijab using kind and     gentle methods. If anyone curses someone who does not deserve to be cursed,     there is a stern warning that the curse will come back on the one who utters     it if it is not justified. This is indicated by the report narrated by     Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of     Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a person     curses something, the curse ascends to heaven, and the gates of heaven are     closed to it. Then it comes back down to earth and the gates of earth are     closed to it. Then it looks right and left, and if it does not find anywhere     to go, it goes to the one who was cursed, and if he deserves it (it befalls     him), otherwise it goes back to the one who uttered it.” Narrated by Abu     Dawood in his Sunan. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send     blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.     End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>    It is permissible for a person to wear two layers of khufoof     or socks. If he wipes over one – in cases where it is permissible to do so,     as we shall see below – then he takes one off, and breaks his wudoo’, it is     permissible for him to wipe over the other, according to the opinion of some     of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) a number     of scenarios in which a person wears two layers of khufoof or socks, as     follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1 – If a person put on socks or khufoof then broke his     wudoo’, then put on another pair before doing wudoo’, the ruling applies to     the first layer, i.e., if he wants to wipe over them after that, he has to     wipe over the first layer, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over     the second layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2 – If he puts on socks or khufoof, then he breaks his wudoo’     and wipes over them, then he puts on a second layer, then he may wipe over     the second layer according to the sound view. It says in al-Furoo’:     That is permissible according to Maalik. End quote. Al-Nawawi said: This is     the best view, because he put them on in a state of purity (tahaarah), and     their view that it is a lesser kind of purity is not acceptable. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If we accept that, then the period of wiping starts from the     first time he wiped over the first layer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In this case he may also wipe over the first layer, without a     doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3 – If he puts khufoof on over khufoof or socks, and he wipes     the outer layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the     remainder of the period? I did not see any clear statement on this, but     al-Nawawi stated that Abu’l-‘Abbaas ibn Surayj said that if he puts     overshoes over the khufoof then one of three scenarios must apply: one of     which is that they become like a single khuff, with the upper layer visible     and the second layer like a lining, therefore he may wipe over the lower     layer until the period for wiping ends from the time he wiped over the upper     layer, which is like the case when the outer surface of the khuff becomes     worn or scratched – it is permissible to wipe over the lining.” End quote     from Fataawa al-Tahaarah, p. 192&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The “overshoe” (jurmooq) is something that is worn over the     regular khufoof, especially in cold countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 1/130&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/211&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on installing an awning that bothers the neighbours",
      "question": "<p>Is installing an awning regarded as annoying one’s neighbours? We set up an awning over our windows so as to protect ourselves from the water that drips from our upstairs neighbours’ laundry, and because of what the children throw of food onto our air-conditioner. But the upstairs neighbours complained about two things: firstly, that they cannot see the street that is directly below the awning, and secondly, that they cannot lower what is called “as-sabt” [a bucket that is lowered to buy something from street vendors].</p>\n<p>Please note: 1. There is no complaint about any difficulty in hanging out laundry, because the distance between balconies is good for them to hang laundry. 2. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the awning is always open and cannot be closed. 3. It is very difficult for me to remove the awning, especially in the place where I hang my laundry, because their children often stand on the balcony and at the window and throw many things down. I also feel very upset if any water drips onto my laundry. I hope that you can advise me as soon as possible, because I am worried that this may come under the heading of bothering neighbours, but my Lord knows that it is not deliberate.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The ruling on putting up an awning is similar to what the jurists have discussed about putting up a balcony. They stated that it is not permissible to put up a balcony if it will harm or bother passers-by or neighbours.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Fatawa wa Rasa’il Samahat ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Shaykh</em>, 7/245: It is not allowed to build a balcony that protrudes from the building on wooden beams, whether it is small or large.</p>\n<p>The three imams [Malik, Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafa`i] favoured the view that it is permissible to do that, so long as it will not cause any harm to passers-by or neighbours, and this is more appropriate. Similar to wood are the long metal beams on which wood is placed. In fact this refers to a balcony and other similar things that could block the air of the street. End quote.</p>\n<p>In <em>al-Bayan fi Madhhab al-Imam ash-Shafa`i</em>, 6/252, it says: If a balcony protrudes into an open ended street (that is, not a cul-de-sac), we think that if it does not bother the Muslims, it is permissible and should not be prevented. This was stated by Malik, al-Awza`i, Ahmad, Is-haq, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on them). End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his ruling: The correct view is that there is nothing wrong with attaching something ordinary to a building that does not bother people, with the permission of the authorities. But if it is something that does bother people, then it is not permissible, even if the authorities in the city, such as the mayor, gave permission for that.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>ash-Sharh al-Mumti` ‘ala Zad al-Mustaqni`</em>, 9/254.</p>\n<p>People usually install awnings for protection from the sun and rain, to conceal the occupants of the house, and to ward off annoyance that can come from upper floors – as mentioned in the question. So what appears to be the case is that it is permissible to install this awning, but you should adjust it when installing it so that there will be room for the neighbours to lower their buckets, because they are clearly bothered by that. But at the same time, they should put a stop to the harm that is coming from their side. If they do not do that, there is nothing wrong with you leaving the awning, because you did not install it for the purpose of annoying and harming your neighbours; rather you did it so as to ward off the annoyance caused by them.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If a man agrees to grant his wife a divorce by khula’, on the basis that she will return the mahr to him, then before she gives him the mahr the husband wants to change his mind, does he have the right to do that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If he has indeed divorced her by khula’, in the sense that     the marriage has been annulled and there is nothing left to be done except     handing over the compensation (i.e., the mahr), then he has no choice in the     matter, even if he has not yet taken back the mahr. But if they have agreed     to khula’ without yet having the marriage annulled, rather they have agreed     that he will let her go when she hands over the mahr, then this does not     mean that the marriage has been annulled, rather it is promise to annul it.     So if it has not yet been annulled, then he has the right to change his mind     and not do that which he had intended. If he had said, “If you give me the     mahr you will be free (I will give you khula’),” then according to the     Hanbali madhhab he does not have the right to change his mind. But according     to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, if he has not yet taken back the mahr then     he has the right to change his mind. In order to be on the safe side, if the     latter scenario has taken place and they want to get back together, they     should make a new marriage contract so as to put themselves beyond any area     of scholarly dispute.</p>\n",

      "title": "How to Remember Allah’s Blessings and Give Thanks for Them",
      "question": "<p>Our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted, enjoins us in the Holy Quran to remember the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us, numerous blessings, such as when He, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning]:</p>\n<p>“O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when armies came to [attack] you and We sent upon them a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see. And ever is Allah , of what you do, Seeing.” [Al-Ahzab 33:9]</p>\n<p>My question is: how can we remember blessings as enjoined by our Lord? Is it what is meant by mentioning them before people and speaking of them, or is what is meant simply calling them to mind, or what? May Allah reward you with all good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The command mentioned in the verse quoted by the questioner is a command to the Companions and the believers to remember the blessings of Allah and His grace towards them, and His kindness to them in causing the defeat of their enemies and frustrating their enemies’ plots.</p>\n<p>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“Here Allah, may He be Exalted, is speaking of His blessings, grace and kindness to His believing slaves when He averted their enemies and inflicted defeat upon them in the year when they came together and formed an alliance against them, which was the year of Al-Khandaq [the Trench].\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir,&nbsp; 6/383)</p>\n<p>When there is a command in the Quran to remember Allah’s blessing, what is meant is to remember it in one’s heart, by calling to mind Allah’s grace and favour in bestowing it upon His slaves; remembering it in one’s words, by speaking of it; and remembering it in one’s physical actions, by not using that blessing in ways that incur the wrath of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.</p>\n<p>Remembering the blessing is <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/125984\" target=\"_blank\">giving thanks for it</a> , and may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words or in one’s actions; each of them confirms the others, unless the gratitude is false.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And remember the favour of Allah upon you.” [Al-Baqarah 2:231]:</p>\n<p>“Remembering may be done in one’s heart, in one’s words and in one’s actions. Remembering it in one’s words means saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it]” [Ad-Duha 93:11]. So you should praise Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, for it by saying: O Allah, to You be praise for what you have blessed me with of wealth, or a wife, or children, and so on.</p>\n<p>Remembering it in one’s heart is by calling it to mind and acknowledging that it is a blessing from Allah.</p>\n<p>Remembering it in one’s actions is by striving to obey Allah, and by showing the effects of His blessing on you.\" (Tafsir Surat Al-Baqarah&nbsp; 3/132)</p>\n<p>Al-Harawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96807\" target=\"_blank\">What is meant by gratitude</a> is three things: acknowledging the blessing, then appreciating the blessing, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/263376\" target=\"_blank\">then giving praise for it</a> .”</p>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the words of Al-Harawi:</p>\n<p>“As for acknowledging it, that means calling it to mind, realising its significance and recognising it as a blessing in and of itself.</p>\n<p>So acknowledging it is done in the mind.</p>\n<p>Appreciating it means showing humility when receiving it from the Bestower, by expressing one’s need for it and acknowledging that it came to him without him deserving it and without him paying any price; rather he sees himself as being completely dependent upon Allah. This attitude shows true appreciation.</p>\n<p>“then giving praise for it”: praise for the Bestower in connection with the blessing is of two types: general and specific.</p>\n<p>The general type is ascribing to Him the attributes of generosity, kindness, munificence and so on.</p>\n<p>The specific type is speaking of His blessing, and stating that it came to him from Him, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But as for the favour of your Lord, report [it].” [Ad-Duha 93:11]</p>\n<p>Regarding this reporting or speaking of the blessing that is enjoined, there are two views:</p>\n<p><strong>The first</strong> is that it means mentioning the blessing and speaking of it, by saying: Allah has blessed me with such and such. Muqatil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Give thanks for what Allah has mentioned of blessings to you in this surah, such as helping orphans, granting guidance after misguidance, and granting self-sufficiency after poverty.</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/217369\" target=\"_blank\">Speaking of the blessings of Allah is gratitude</a> , as in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whoever has a favour done for him, let him reciprocate, and if he cannot reciprocate, then let him praise [the person who did him the favour], for if he praises him, then he has thanked him, but if he conceals it, then he has been ungrateful towards him. And whoever pretends to have what he has not been given is like one who wears two garments of falsehood.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 215; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>This Hadith mentions three types of people: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/146025\" target=\"_blank\">one who is grateful for the blessing</a> and gives praise for it; one who denies it and conceals it; and one who pretends to be one of those who were given it when that is not the case, so he pretends to have something that he was not given. In another report it says: “Whoever does not give thanks for a little will not give thanks for a great deal, and whoever does not show gratitude to people has not shown gratitude to Allah. Speaking of the blessing of Allah is gratitude, and not speaking of it is ingratitude. Unity is a mercy and division is a punishment.” [Narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad in Zawa’id Al-Musnad, 18449; classed as sound by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>The second view is that speaking of the blessing that is enjoined in this verse [at the end of Surah Ad-Duha, quoted above] means calling people to Allah, conveying His message and teaching the Ummah. Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to Prophethood. Az-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It means: Convey that with which you [O Prophet] have been sent, and speak of the Prophethood that Allah has bestowed upon you. Al-Kalbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It refers to the Quran, which Allah commanded him to recite.</p>\n<p>The correct view is that it includes both types, because each of them is a blessing for which it is enjoined to give thanks and speak of it. Manifesting it is part of being grateful for it.\" (Madarij As-Salikin 2/237)</p>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding gratitude:</p>\n<p>“It is based on three pillars: acknowledging it inwardly, speaking of it outwardly, and using it to earn the pleasure of the One Who granted it and bestowed it.\" (Al-Wabil As-Sayyib, p. 5)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The Eids of the Muslims have not been prescribed only for the purpose of joy, fun and visiting one another; rather they are among the symbols and acts of worship of the religion, so the Sunnah on these occasions is for the Muslims to celebrate them openly and proclaim them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Eids are among the most specific distinguishing features of different religions, and among the most obvious of their rituals.</p>\n<p>End quote from Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem (1/528)</p>\n<p>Hence you will find that every religion has its own festivals that its followers care about and celebrate openly, because they are an important part of their religion.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Expressing joy on the occasion of the Eids is one of the symbols of the religion.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fath al-Baari (2/443)</p>\n<p>So expressing joy on Eid is one of the acts of worship by which the Muslim draws closer to Allah.</p>\n<p>Ahmad (24334) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said on that day – i.e., the day on which the Ethiopians played in the mosque: “Let the Jews know that in our religion there is lenience. Verily I have been sent with an easygoing religion.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (3219).</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is no contradiction between expressing joy on Eid and feeling sorrow for what has befallen the Muslims and grieving for their situation. The Muslim expresses his joy on Eid in order to show his religious commitment openly and to show his support for his religion and at the same time he shares the sorrows of the Muslims.</p>\n<p>So the Muslim should combine both matters: he should practice the rituals and acts of worship of Islam openly, such as the Eid prayer, and he should express some measure of joy and happiness. And at the same time he should feel sorrow for what has befallen his brethren, and he should feel their pain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the more the Muslim feels the pain and anguish of his Muslim brothers, the less he will indulge in permissible kinds of entertainment and play, even if he allows himself expressions of joy on Eid and gratitude for the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21284\">21284</a> for more information on what we must do with regard to the slaughter of Muslims around the world.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7837\">7837</a> for information on how to console our brethren who are stricken by calamity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112151\" target=\"_blank\">my affairs</a> ), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it.</p>\n<p>(Reported by al-Bukhari, 6841; similar reports are also recorded by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Ahmad)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Commentary_on_the_hadith_of_istikharah\">Commentary on the hadith of <em>istikharah</em></span></h3>\n<p>Ibn Hajr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadith:</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112094\" target=\"_blank\">Istikharah</a> is a word which means asking Allah to help one make a choice, meaning choosing the best of two things where one needs to choose one of them.</p>\n<p>Concerning the phrase The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to make istikharah in all things, Ibn Abi Jamrah said: It is a general phrase which refers to something specific. With regard to matters that are wajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (liked or encouraged), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to do them, and with regard to matters that are haram (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to avoid them. The issue of istikharah is confined to matters that are mubah (allowed), or in mustahabb matters when there is a decision to be made as to which one should be given priority. I say: it refers to both great and small matters, and probably an insignificant issue could form the groundwork for a big issue.</p>\n<p>The phrase If any one of you is concerned appears in the version narrated by Ibn Mas’ud as: if any one of you wants to do something</p>\n<p>Let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer. This is mentioned to make it clear that it does not mean Fajr prayer, for example. Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar: He can pray istikarah after two rak’ahs of regular sunnah prayer done at zhuhr for example, or after two rak’ahs of any nafl prayers whether they are regularly performed or not It seems to be the case that if he made the intention to pray istikharah at the same time as intending to pray that particular prayer, this is fine, but not if he did not have this intention.</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The wisdom behind putting the salat before the du’a is that istikharah is intended to combine the goodness of this world with the goodness of the next. A person needs to knock at the door of the King (Allah), and there is nothing more effective for this than prayer, because it contains glorification and praise of Allah, and expresses one's need for Him at all times.</p>\n<p>The phrase then let him say would seem to imply that the du’a should be said after finishing the prayer, and the word thumma (then) probably means after reciting all the words of the salat and before saying salam.</p>\n<p>The phrase O Allah, I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your knowledge is explaining because You know best. Similarly, by virtue of Your power most likely means seeking Your help. I seek ability (astaqdiruka) means I ask You to give me the power or ability (qudrah) to do whatever is being asked for, or it probably means I ask You to decree (tuqaddir) this for me. So it may mean making it easy.</p>\n<p>I ask You of Your great bounty refers to the fact that Allah gives out of His great generosity, but no one has the right to His blessings. This is the opinion of Ahl al-Sunnah.</p>\n<p>You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not refers to the fact that power and knowledge belong to Allah alone, and the slave has no share of them except what Allah decrees for him.</p>\n<p>O Allah, if in Your knowledge this matter, according to one report, he should mention it by name. It is apparent from the context that he should state it, but it is probably sufficient to be thinking of the matter whilst making this du’a.</p>\n<p>Then ordain it for me means make it happen for me or it may mean make it easy for me.</p>\n<p>Then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it means so that my heart will no longer feel attached to it after it has been turned away.</p>\n<p>Make me pleased with it means make me content with it, so that I will never regret asking for it or be sorry that it happened, because I do not know how it will turn out, even if at the time of asking I am pleased with it.</p>\n<p>The secret is that one’s heart should not be attached to the matter in question, because that will result in a person becoming restless. Being pleased with something means that one’s heart is content with the decree of Allah.” (Summarized from the commentary of al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) on the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Da’wat and Kitab al-Tawheed.)</p>\n<p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>\n",

      "question": "<p>IS it proper to hang Quranic verses from the wall to<br />\n1. protect one from evil things<br />\n2. beautify the room with divine words<br />\n3. with the intention that it will gain me rewards<br />\nMay allah rewad u.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.</p>\n<p>(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?</p>\n<p>His Eminence replied as follows:</p>\n<p>If the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah is the Source of strength.</p>\n",
