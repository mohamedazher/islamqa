      "title": "Why did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his two companions flee from the battlefield and hide in the cave?",
      "question": "<p>According to Sahih Muslim, Book of Jihad &amp; Expeditions,</p>\n<div>4413.</div>\n<div>It has been reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that (when the enemy got the upper hand) on the day of the Battle of Uhud, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was left with only seven men from the ansar and two men from the Quraish. When the enemy advanced towards him and overwhelmed him, he said: Whoso turns them away from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Ansar came forward and fought (the enemy) until he was killed. The enemy advanced and overwhelmed him again and he repeated the words: Whoso turns them away, from us will attain Paradise or will be my Companion in Paradise. A man from the Arsar came forward and fought until he was killed. This state continued until the seven Ansar were killed (one after the other). Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to his two Companions: We have not done justice to our Companions.</div>\n<div>Did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) endanger the lives of those 7 Ansar to protect his own? That seems unfair. Why couldnt they all just hide or leave, since its OK to leave the battlefield if the enemy outnumbers tremendously. What is the wisdom behind this decision? And, why did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his 2 companions leave the battle field &amp; seek refuge in the cave?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The worst thing that a reader or researcher can do is give himself the right to pass judgement upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or upon one of his companions, on the basis of an incident that he reads about in some report, without bearing in mind what happened before and after that, and without examining or understanding the context, even if the whole story is not narrated in that particular report. What the critic must do is try to think about it and find out about it, and put together the pieces of the story that is assumed to have taken place. Only then will he be able to form an objective and fair-minded picture of what happened.</p>\n<p>When you read the hadith of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that on the day of Uhud the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was left with only seven men of the Ansaar and two men of Quraysh.</p>\n<p>When they were surrounded, he said: “Who will repel them from us and Paradise will be his, or he will be my companion in Paradise?” One of the Ansaari men went forward and fought until he was killed… and that continued until all seven had been killed. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to his two companions: “We have not been fair to our companions”,</p>\n<p>the first thing you should bear in mind is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not to be accused by any of his companions or any of the Muslims. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the Messenger of light, guidance, and mercy to all of mankind, and the future of all of humanity is connected to his call; the fate of all religions is connected to his religion. Therefore Allah ended all divine messages with him, and raised him in status and renown throughout the world, and He protected him from people, by the means that He, may He be glorified and exalted, decreed.</p>\n<p>Therefore his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would love to sacrifice their lives and their wealth for him, with no hesitation or resentment whatsoever, because by protecting the Prophet of Allah, they would be protecting the light of Tawheed, justice, righteousness and goodness throughout the world. By means of such sacrifices the message of Islam continued, and the Muslim ummah was shaped and formed, and attained the highest possible level of glory, justice, knowledge and peace. All of that was due to the immense sacrifices made by the noble Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them).</p>\n<p>Therefore it is not possible for any Muslim – let alone any Sahaabi who was defending al-Madinah al-Munawwarah alongside the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – to think of his Prophet in anything but the most perfect terms, or to think of his own life as being more deserving of protection and being given precedence than the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the best example and the best model, for he took up arms and joined his companions in defending the sanctity of the Muslims, warding off the efforts of the haters and wrongdoers, and protecting Muslim lives, honour and wealth against the ignorant tyranny of Quraysh and their arrogance in the land. Because of his courage, his companions felt more secure by being near him when the fighting grew intense.</p>\n<p>Ahmad (1346) narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When fighting grew intense and the two groups met in battle, we sought protection by drawing close to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace, you), and none of us was closer to the enemy than him.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir said in his commentary on al-Musnad: Its isnaad is saheeh.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (2627) and Muslim (2307) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the best of people, and he was the most generous of people and the most courageous of people. One night the people of Madinah were in a state of panic, and some people went out towards the sound. They were met by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who was coming back, as he had gone towards the sound before them. He was riding the horse of Abu Talhah bareback, with his sword around his neck, and he said: “Do not be afraid, do not be afraid.”</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>From this hadith we learn several things, one of which is that it highlights the courage of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he hastened to go out towards the enemy before all the people, and because he went out and found out what was going on, and came back before the people got there. End quote.</p>\n<p>What is meant by riding a horse bareback is that it had no saddle on it. This is reflective of his perfect courage (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>During the battle of Hunayn, when most of the Sahaabah fled from the battlefield, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) started urging his mule on towards the enemy, saying: “I am the Prophet and no lie; I am the son of ‘Abd al-Muttalib.” Al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: No one among the people was seen to be more courageous on that day than him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3042) and Muslim (1776).</p>\n<p>But the calamities suffered by the Muslims at Uhud were great indeed. The cheek of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was injured, he was bleeding and his tooth had been broken. He himself fought and defended his companions in the most difficult circumstances. He – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him, blessings and peace of Allah be upon him – was at the head, protecting their lives, standing between them and the aggressors of Quraysh; he did not stay safe and sound in his house or his tent at that critical moment.</p>\n<p>What the questioner is confused about is the final moments of that incident, which were very painful and difficult for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his noble Companions. He was exhausted from fighting and bearing arms, and his wound was bleeding with no treatment or anything that could stop the bleeding. He fell in a hole, and a link of chain mail got embedded in his cheek and could not be removed. His iron helmet was broken on his head, and large rocks were being hurled at him, until rumours spread that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had been killed, because of what he went through of hardships. He – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him – was approaching the age of sixty, and undoubtedly could not have the physical strength and endurance that a young man would have.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hishaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Ibn Ishaaq said: The Muslims were put to flight and the enemy slew many of them. It was a day of trial and testing in which Allah honoured several with martyrdom, until the enemy reached the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He was hit with a stone so that he fell on his side and one of his teeth was smashed, his face scored, and his lip injured. The man who wounded him was ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ishaaq said: Humayd at-Taweel told me, from Anas ibn Maalik: The incisor of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was broken on the Day of Uhud, and his face was scored. The blood began to run down his face and he began to wipe it away, saying the while: “How can people prosper who have stained their Prophet’s face with blood while he was calling them to their Lord?” So Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, revealed concerning that the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Not for you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but for Allâh) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the Zâlimûn (polytheists, disobedients, and wrong-doers)”</p>\n<p>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:128].</p>\n<p>Ibn Hishaam said: Rabeeh ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Sa‘eed al-Khudri narrated from his father, from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri that ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas hit the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with a stone on that day, and broke his lower right incisor and wounded him in his lower lip, and that ‘Abdullah ibn Shihaab az-Zuhri struck him on the forehead, and Ibn Qam’ah wounded his cheek, so two links of chain mail became embedded in his cheek. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fell in a hole that had been made by Abu ‘Aamir so that the Muslims would fall into it without realising. ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) took the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by the hand and Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullah lifted him up until he was standing upright.</p>\n<p>End quote from Seerat Ibn Hishaam (2/79).</p>\n<p>When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had suffered so much hardship and a group of the mushrikeen gathered around him, wanting to kill him, in addition to what he had already gone through, a group of his noble companions rallied around him to defend him with their lives, as Ibn Hazm said: The mushrikeen caught up with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and a group of the Muslims (may Allah be pleased with them) charged to his defence, of whom there were seven – and it was said that there were more – until they were all killed. The last of them was ‘Amaarah ibn Yazeed ibn as-Sakan.</p>\n<p>End quote from Jawaami‘ as-Seerah (p. 127)</p>\n<p>In that situation, what is wrong with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) seeking help and support from his companions?</p>\n<p>What is wrong with it if those who were fighting for the sake of Allah cooperated to ward off aggression and defend one another, as all fighters do, the strong helping the injured, and protecting one another?</p>\n<p>Over and above all of that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was holding firm to the rope of Allah and trusting that He would protect him; he was taking all possible measures to achieve that, which included asking his companions to help him in that, so that the call of truth would not die in its infancy and the wrongdoers and aggressors would not prevail, after having crossed desert and wilderness from Makkah to Madinah, seeking to commit aggression and wreak havoc upon the believers in their safe and secure city, and so that the disbelievers would not divert them from their religion and impose upon them the fetters of shirk and jaahiliyyah in which there is no goodness, no ethics, no truth and no true religion.</p>\n<p>This is a brief glimpse into that painful scene, and it is sufficient to explain the reason that prompted the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to honour his companions by urging them to come and defend him, by saying: “Who will repel them from us and Paradise will be his?” The impact of what had befallen him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – as it says in as-Seerah al-Halabiyyah (2/322, 324) – meant that he could not climb upon a rock in order to protect himself, until Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) helped him, and on that day he led his companions in prayer whilst seated.</p>\n<p>What we think is that what was not mentioned in any of the reports was even more serious and grievous, because war at that time would inflict serious and painful physical injuries for which there would be no treatment. If the questioner had imagined the pain that could be caused by swords and wounds and borne in mind the well-known military principle which says that fighters and their commanders are more aware of the circumstances of their battle than others, he would not have dared to blame or criticise the way in which the defence plan was drawn up on the basis of a single report taken out of context. Rather, even if he read all of history, he would never be able to truly understand what happened as the people involved themselves understood it, except only approximately. In that case he will understand that his doubt and questioning were not appropriate.</p>\n<p>With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “We have not been fair to our companions (ma ansafna as-haabana)”, that does not mean that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) endangered their lives to protect his own. Rather what is meant is a rebuke to the two men of Quraysh who did not go forward to defend him too. They should all have participated in defending and protecting him, and should not have fallen short in that important duty that should not have been carried out only by the Ansaar who went forth one after another until all seven were martyred.</p>\n<p>One of the scholars said that the more correct vowelling of this phrase is ma ansafana as-haabuna (meaning: our companions have not been fair to us), referring to those of the Sahaabah who fled and left him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to face this wounding and attempt to kill him by himself.</p>\n<p>Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said:</p>\n<p>With regard to the battle of Uhud, if we read the phrase as “ma ansafna as-haabana (we have not been fair to our companions)”, as we have vowelled it, then it refers to the Ansaar who fought in his defence and were all killed, whilst others were not. Some of the narrators of the book of Muslim vowelled it so that it reads “ma ansafana as-haabuna (our companions have not been fair to us),” which refers to those who fled and left him with only a few people. And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>End quote from Mashaariq al-Anwaar ‘ala Sihaah al-Athaar (2/16)</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This may be difficult for some people to understand, so they ask: how could he instruct them to fight and then say, We have not been fair to our companions? Was he ever anything but fair?</p>\n<p>The response to that is: people were obliged to protect the Messenger of Allah with their lives, so when he said: “Who will repel them from us?” all of them should have hastened to respond, so for some of them to lag behind was not fair.</p>\n<p>It may be that he was referring to the two Qurashi men, because they left the Ansaar to do that on their own.</p>\n<p>End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Saheehayn (3/305)</p>\n<p>Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What this means is: Quraysh have not been fair to the Ansaar, because the two Qurashis did not go out and fight; rather the Ansaar went out, one after another.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Muslim (12/147)</p>\n<p>Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If the word is read as ansafna (so what is meant is “we have not been fair”), then what is meant is when the Ansaar went out to fight one after another until they were all killed, but the two Qurashi men did not go out, he said that – meaning: Quraysh have not been fair to the Ansaar.</p>\n<p>If the word is read as ansafana (so that what is meant is “[they] have not been fair to us”), then what is meant is the companions who fled and deserted the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) so that he was left alone with a few men, and they were killed one after another. They were not fair to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and those who stood firm with him.</p>\n<p>End quote from Zaad al-Ma‘aad (3/183).</p>\n<p>There is no dispute among all people that the commander in a battle is in a unique position, unlike anyone else, and he is to be surrounded by protective measures to defend him, such as are not available to other soldiers, and that if the commander is captured or killed, it is one of the greatest blows to the army and may well be the cause of its defeat, both psychologically and militarily, so how can he be compared to others?</p>\n<p>So how about if the commander is the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), may my father and mother be sacrificed for him?</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I am divorced and I have two daughters. I take some of my daughters’ maintenance money every month for my medical treatment, because I am sick. With regard to my daughters’ food and drink, it is my father who is sponsoring that. What is the ruling on my taking some of my daughters’ money every month? Please note that I have no other option except to do that.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that the mother who has custody of her children does not have the right to take anything from her children’s maintenance money in return for taking care of them; rather she is entrusted with the money that is sent for her children’s maintenance and is expected to dispose of it according to what is in their best interests.</p>\n<p>Ad-Dardir al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She does not have the right to spend any of her child’s maintenance money on herself in return for taking care of the child. End quote from <em>Bulghat as-Salik li Aqrab al-Masalik</em> (2/765).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is permissible for the father and mother to take from their children’s wealth for their needs, so long as it does not harm the children.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘A’ishah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “A man’s son is part of his earnings, among the best of his earnings, so you may take from their wealth.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3529); classed as sahih by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Amir as-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated from Abu’z-Zubayr that he heard Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah say: The father and mother may take from their child’s wealth without his permission.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Risalah Latifah fi Sharh Hadith Anta wa Maluka li Abik</em> (p. 24). The report was narrated by Ibn Hazm in <em>al-Muhalla</em> with his isnad (6/385).</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your children are a gift from Allah to you, {He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males} [al-Shoora 42:49]. They and their wealth are yours if you need it.” Narrated by al-Hakim in <em>al-Mustadrak</em> (3123), who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in <em>al-Kubra</em> (15745). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in <em>as-Silsilah as-Sahihah</em> (2564). See the commentary of Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut et al. on <em>Sunan Ibn Majah</em>, hadith no. 2137.</p>\n<p>As-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child’s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:</p>\n<p>She does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.</p>\n<p>But if it is for another reason – meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child – and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child’s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Hashiyat as-Sawi ‘ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir</em> (2/765).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child’s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.” And he said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” This undoubtedly refers to the father’s rights, but it also includes the mother’s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child’s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan</em>.</p>\n<p>Based on the above:</p>\n<p>It is permissible for you to take from your children’s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

If no, would not it hurt her feelings? Please, answer me on this issue.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. At the same time he should direct them towards what will benefit them, even if that affects his relationship with his wife. The aims of sharee’ah and protecting one’s religion – which is one of the most important aims of sharee’ah – take priority over everything else.</p>\n<p>Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about a man who had a Christian wife – could he let her go out to join in the Christian festivals or to go to the church?

We do not differentiate between the Messengers of Allah, and we do not differentiate between the revealed Books; all of them are the words of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion in spite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (Torah), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?”&nbsp;[Al-Baqarah 2:75]</p>\n<p>What they used to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2001\" target=\"_blank\">distort is the Torah</a> , but here Allah, may He be Exalted, calls it the “Word of Allah”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (2652) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Adam and Musa debated. Musa said: O Adam, you are our father but you caused our doom and caused us to be expelled from Paradise. Adam said to him: You are Musa, Allah chose you to speak to and wrote (the Torah) for you with His own hand. Are you blaming me for something that Allah decreed for me forty years before He created me?” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Adam got the better of Musa, Adam got the better of Musa.”</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The view of the early generations, the Companions and those who followed them in truth, and all the leading scholars of the Muslims, such as the four Imams and others, is that which is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, which is what is in accordance with the clear rational evidence: that the Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed and not created; it comes from Him and will return to Him. He is the One Who spoke the Quran, the Torah and the Gospel, and other words; they are not created and separate from Him. He, may He be Glorified, speaks by His will and power, and His word is within His Essence, and is not a creation separate from Him […] The words of Allah have no end, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to mankind): ‘If the sea were ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if we brought (another sea) like it for its aid’” [Al-Kahf 18:109].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified, spoke the Quran in Arabic and the Torah in Hebrew […]&nbsp;Whoever regards His words as created must say: Is that which is created the One Who spoke to Musa: “Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship Me, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat As-Salat) for My Remembrance” [Ta-Ha 20:14]. This is impossible; these cannot be anything other than the words of the Lord of the Worlds. As Allah spoke the Quran, the Torah, and other Scriptures, with their meanings and words which consist of letters, none of that is created; rather that is the words of the Lord of the Worlds.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/37-41) (See also: Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 12/355-356)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Mustafa Ar-Ruhaybani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Swearing by the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, or the Quran, or a surah or verse thereof, is a (valid) oath, because it is one of His attributes. So whoever swears by it or by any part of it has sworn an oath by one of the attributes of Allah, may He be Exalted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The same applies to swearing by the Torah or any of the other Books of Allah, may He be exalted, such as the Gospel and the Zabur. This is an oath for which expiation is required (if it is broken), because an oath sworn by the Torah or Gospel in general terms is swearing by that which was sent down from Allah, may He be Exalted, not that which has been changed or altered, and the sanctity thereof is not waived by the fact that it has been abrogated by the rulings of the Quran, as is similar to the case of some verses in the Quran the rulings of which were abrogated. That does not alter the fact that it is the words of Allah, may He be Exalted, and as it is His words, it is one of His attributes, as is the Quran.\" (Matalib Uli An-Nuha,&nbsp;6/361)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is well-known that Allah sent down Books to the Prophets. He sent down the Torah to Musa, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/43148\" target=\"_blank\">He sent down the Gospel to `Isa</a> , He sent down the Zabur to Dawud, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/259935\" target=\"_blank\">He sent down Scripture (Suhuf) to Ibrahim</a> , as&nbsp; He said (interpretation of the meaning): “The Scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses)” [Al-A`la 87:19]. Undoubtedly all of that is the words of Allah that He spoke, and these words include His laws and His commands and prohibitions.\" (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Jibrin, 63/117)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My question deals with a friend of mine who was ignorantly joking. When my friend was teased by another friend he ignorantly picked up his phone out of joking and said I have to tell Allah. Then he said on the phone \"Hello, Allah\" as to tell Allah. I know this is incorrect but is this shirk?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Belief in Allah is based on respect and veneration of Him and submission to Him. Hence Allah criticized the kaafirs and stated that they associated others with Him because they did not make a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!”&nbsp;[Al-Zumar 39:67]</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Almighty, by Whose might the heavens might almost be rent asunder, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Nearly the heavens might be rent asunder from above them (by His Majesty), and the angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and ask for forgiveness for those on the earth. Verily, Allah is the Oft‑Forgiving, the Most Merciful”&nbsp;[Al-Shoora 42:5]</p>\n<p>Anyone who studies the creation of Allah will see some of the signs of His greatness. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Kursiy (Footstool) and Throne: “The seven heavens, in comparison to the Footstool, are like a ring lying in the wilderness, and the superiority of the Throne to the Footstool is like the superiority of that wilderness to that ring.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (1/223).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Veneration of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, cannot co-exist in one heart with mockery of Him. Hence mocking Allah, may He be exalted, or His verses or Messengers is kufr, no matter what form it takes, whether it is in earnest or in jest. Allah says in Soorat al-Tawbah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The hypocrites fear lest a Soorah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ‘(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’</p>\n<p>65.&nbsp;If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah&nbsp;, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger&nbsp; that you were mocking?’</p>\n<p>66.&nbsp;Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals)”&nbsp;[Al-Tawbah 9:64-66]</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: This shows that mocking Allah and His verses and signs is kufr and this verse indicates that the one who belittles the Messenger of Allah in earnest or in jest is a kaafir.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Saarim al-Maslool (2/70).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said in Ahkaam al-Quran commenting on this verse: What they – the hypocrites – said must have been either in earnest or in jest, but no matter what it was, it is kufr, because joking about kufr is also kufr, and there is no difference of opinion concerning this among the ummah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-Sa’di said: Mocking Allah and His Messenger is kufr which puts one beyond the pale of Islam, because the religion is based on veneration of Allah and of His religion and His Messengers, and mocking any of that is contrary to this principle and is diametrically opposed to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What this man said, in which he showed disrespect towards Allah – exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say – and spoke as if he regarded Allah as equal in status to a human being and thought that he could address Him as such, is kufr, as anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the religion of Allah would realize, and no one would do that but one who is extremely ignorant or a man whose heart has no knowledge of Allah and no respect for Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then he added to his mockery and said “I must tell Allah.” Does Allah, may He be exalted, need to be told anything by an ignorant wrongdoer?!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven”&nbsp;[Aal ‘Imraan 3:5]</p>\n<p>This wretch has to renew his faith and enter Islam again, and repent to Allah from this blatant kufr. For the rest of his life he must do a lot of good and righteous deeds, as much as he can, in the hope that Allah may pardon him and forgive him for his ignorance and transgression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>What is the ruling on the following:</div>\n<div>1. Pieces of jewellery on which the Name of Allah or names such as ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, ‘Abd-Allah etc., are written?</div>\n<div>2. Pieces of jewellery on which signs of the zodiac (such as Aries, Scorpio, Libra, etc.) appear, whether they are imprinted or appear as a three-dimensional image that has a shadow? What is the ruling on praying wearing such items?</div>\n<div>3. Pieces of jewellery on which the picture of a head appears – without the body?</div>\n<div>4. Some pieces of gold which may be added to jewellery on which there is a picture of a man's profile, such as sovereigns bearing a profile of King George, etc.</div>\n<div>5. Stars of David (Jewish stars) or crosses, or any other symbols that are connected to the Jews and Christians?</div>\n<div>6. Gold rings that are designed specifically for men, which the shopkeepers say that they will not sell to Muslims?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly: it is not permissible to engrave aayaat from the Qur’aan or the Name of Allah on metals or stone, because this is not the purpose for which these aayaat were revealed, and because there is the fear that this would expose these aayaat and the Name of Allah to disrespect. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: using these signs of the zodiac is an idea that comes from jaahiliyyah and the Muslim is obliged to steer clear of this and of everything that could lead to a revival of these jaahili ideas. This is in addition to the fact that they involve pictures of animate beings. On this basis it is not permissible to make or collect jewellery that bears these images, or to pray wearing such items.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly and fourthly: the ahaadeeth which forbid images of animate beings are general in meaning and include all images which are called images of living beings. This also includes images of the head, so on this basis it is not permissible to make these pieces.</p>\n<p>Selling and buying pictures of animate beings is not permitted, because it was reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“Allah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and idols.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 3/43; Muslim, 3/1207).</p>\n<p>This prohibition exists also because it may lead to exaggerated ideas about those who are represented in the pictures, as happened in the case of the people of Nooh. In Saheeh al-Imaam al-Bukhaari, it is reported that concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwaa‘, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya‘ooq nor Nasr’” [Nooh 71:23], Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “These were the names of righteous people among the people of Nooh. When they died, the Shaytaan inspired their people to set up stone altars in the places where they used to sit, and these were named after them. So they did this, but they did not worship them. But when that generation died and knowledge was lost, the worship of these people began.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6/73). And there are many other texts which also forbid making and using images of living beings.</p>\n<p>This applies to anything that is in the form of an animate creature. With regard to items on which there are pictures of animate beings, whether those items are made of gold, silver, paper, fabric or are tools, if they are circulated among people in order to be hung on walls etc. in a manner which is not considered disrespectful, then it is haraam to deal in them, because of the comprehensive nature of the evidence which states that making images is haraam. But if the item on which there is an image is to be used in a manner that implies disrespect, such as a tool used for cutting, a carpet that will be stepped on, a pillow that will be slept on, etc., then this is permissible, because of the report narrated in al-Saheehayn from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which she said that she hung up a curtain on which there were images, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tore it down. She said: I cut it up and made two pillows out of it, and he used to recline upon them. According to a version narrated by Ahmad: I cut it up and made two cushions out of it, and I saw him reclining on one of them and there was an image on it. (al-Bukhaari,6/103, 214, 247; Muslim,3/1168-1169, no. 2107). We should note that making images of animate beings is haraam and such images should not be used in crafts, on clothing or in anything else, because of the evidence referred to above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifthly: it is not permissible to make jewellery that bears the symbols of kufr, such as crosses and stars of David. It is not permissible to buy or sell such items.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sixthly: it is not permissible to sell gold rings which are made specifically for men if they are going to wear them. The shopkeepers’ comments that they will not sell them to Muslims is no excuse, because they are in a Muslim country, and whoever lives in a Muslim country should not deal in anything except that which has been permitted by the pure sharee’ah of Islam. This argument is like the argument of the one who sells alcohol and says that he will only sell it to the kuffaar, because gold rings are haraam for men.</p>\n",

Undoubtedly the one who suffers sickness and bears it with patience, Allah will expiate his sins thereby and raise him in status. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will record for him thereby one hasanah (good deed) or will remove from him one sin.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2572)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_pray_at_home_if_you_are_sick\">Can you pray at home if you are sick?</span></h3>\n<p>The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/115117\" target=\"_blank\">sick person is excused from Jumu`ah prayer</a> and from <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/40113\" target=\"_blank\">praying in congregation</a> . What is meant by that is the kind of sickness which means that it is too difficult for the person to go and pray in the mosque. This is based on the following evidence:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]</li>\n<li>And He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp; “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]</li>\n<li>And He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;“No blame or sin is there upon the blind, nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick.” [Al-Fath 48:17]</li>\n<li>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.” (Agreed upon)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell sick, he did not attend prayers in congregation, even though his house was beside the mosque.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Ibn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick…” (Narrated by Muslim, 654)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this evidence indicates that the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50075\" target=\"_blank\">sick person is spared the obligation to pray Jumu`ah and prayers in congregation</a> .&nbsp;(See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/438)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is obligatory for Muslim men to pray in the mosque and increase the numbers of the Muslims, and to go out to the mosques (to pray), otherwise they will be resembling the hypocrites. Ibn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) thought of burning down the houses of those who stayed away from the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you and every Muslim who is able to must pray in the mosque; the Muslim is not allowed to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98739\" target=\"_blank\">pray at home</a> unless he has a valid shar’i excuse such as <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/97844\" target=\"_blank\">sickness or fear</a> .

I draw close to him and he said: “Speak.”</p>\n<p>I said: What should I say?</p>\n<p>He said: “Speak.”</p>\n<p>I said: What should I say?</p>\n<p>He said: “Say: {Qul a‘udhu bi rabbi l falaq (Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak)} until you complete the surah, then say {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb in-nas (Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind)} until you complete the surah.” Then he said: “The people will not seek refuge with Allah with anything better than these two.”</p>\n<p>A sahih hadith, narrated by an-Nasa’i (5429) and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>You should be careful lest the Shaytan prevent you from doing acts of worship or praying in congregation by scaring you and making you afraid. For all that he wants is to prevent you from praying in congregation, then Allah knows best what else he could lead you to of evil or prevent you from doing of good after that.</p>\n<p>May Allah make you steadfast, give you courage, reassure you and avert from you the schemes, temptations and whispers of the Shaytan.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
