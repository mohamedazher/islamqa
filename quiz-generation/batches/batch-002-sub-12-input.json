      "title": "Should she go ahead with this marriage or not?",
      "question": "<p>I am a young Muslim woman with a good heart and I am righteous in all my actions. Fate decreed that I should become engaged to my cousin, whom I did not know before because he lives in America. I got to know him a little when he visited our country, and after that he left. We have gotten engaged and we agreed to get married in eight months' time, so that I can finish my studies, but after he left and we got in touch with one another, we began to disagree about many matters. Every time we phone one another it only ends in feeling upset, and he is not the person that I knew before; he has changed completely. We have thought about separating, but our relatives have interfered and prevented a divorce. But the relationship did go back to what it was at first. I am confused about what to do – should I go ahead or cancel it?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If your cousin is righteous and adheres to his religion,     prays regularly and is of good character, then do not hasten to seek a     separation. Many minor differences can be dealt with and an understanding     can be reached. It may need some time in order to get used to one another     and become comfortable with one another. But the most important matter is     his relationship with his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and his     adherence to his religion. The one who is religious will help his family to     obey Allaah and will being them closer to pleasing Allaah. Such a person is     usually trustworthy, for his religious commitment will prevent him from     mistreating his family or being unjust, especially if you travel with him     and go to live far from your family. But if he is careless with regard to     his religious commitment and does not pray regularly, and is not known to be     righteous and upright, then undoubtedly marriage to him is a dangerous     matter, because the one who is negligent towards his religious commitment     will be more negligent in other matters; if a person neglects the rights of     his Lord and Creator, it will come as no surprise that he neglects the     rights of others. Leaving one who is like this now is better than leaving     him later, before the marriage is consummated and any children are born.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to pray istikhaarah, for the one who seeks guidance     from his Lord and prays istikhaarah cannot lose. And consult righteous     people among your family who know about your husband and his character and     nature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information on praying istikhaarah, please see     questions no. <a href=\"/en/answers/11981\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">11981</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/2217\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">2217</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You should strive to equip yourself with the best of     characteristics and attitudes, for both spouses are enjoined to do that. The     problem may also be due to you as well. Perhaps your husband has complaints     about your attitude and behaviour just as you have about his. We ask Allaah     to set your affairs straight and to make good easy for you wherever it is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In your question you say \"fate decreed\". This is a grave     error, for fate has no will. What you should say is \"Allaah willed\" or     \"Allaah decreed\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was     asked about saying, \"circumstances dictated that such and such should     happen\" or \"fate decreed that such and such should happen.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Saying \"fate willed\" or \"circumstances willed\" are     reprehensible phrases, because circumstances or time have no will, and fate     has no will. Rather the One who wills and decrees is Allaah, may He be     exalted and glorified. It would be better for a person to say: \"The decree     of Allaah dictated that such and such should happen.\" There is nothing wrong     with that. But it is not permissible to attribute will to fate. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo' Fataawa Ibn 'Uthaymeen,     3/113&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is the person who was entrusted with something liable if he leaves it in the airport because of excess weight?",
      "question": "<p>My friend asked me for a favour to carry her luggage abroad, and I agreed. At the airport, I realized the weight limit has exceeded (due to misreading my ticket) and had to leave some items behind. In rush and illness, I forgot 3 items at the airport while sending back excess baggage. Unaware of this loss, I travelled and delivered the rest of her belongings, approximately 11-12 kgs of goods, to her.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, she informed me that some or all goods (not sure) belonged to a 3rd party, not her (She didn't inform me before), and the missing items were theirs. My friend demanded $105 as compensation for the lost items of 3rd party, holding me fully responsible for the accidental loss and denied to take any burden of loss on herself. I paid the amount but suggested that it's fair for me to then seek remuneration for my service of transporting goods from abroad as I compensated for the loss of 3rd party. However, my friend took the money and refused, saying no conditions were set before I agreed to carry her belongings so my claim for service is baseless.</p>\n<p>• In a scenario with no prior terms and conditions, is the person carrying someone's goods responsible to compensate for accidental damages or losses during the journey?</p>\n<p>• The money I paid, was it their lawful right and permissible for them to keep it in this matter?</p>\n<p>• What would be the solution for this issue?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If someone is asked to transport some luggage and the like, this luggage is regarded as a trust under his care, and he is not liable for loss or damage unless he transgressed or was negligent, whether he is transporting it voluntarily or in return for payment. That is because in the case of one who is hired or appointed as a proxy, whatever is given to him to take care of is a trust (amanah).</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat</em> (2/202): The proxy is in a position of trust. He is not liable if something is lost or damaged whilst in his care if he has not been negligent, because he is the proxy of the owner in possessing and disposing of it. So if it is destroyed when it is under his care, it is as if it was destroyed when under the care of its owner. This is like one who is given something for safekeeping, or the guardian of an orphan, and so on. It makes no difference whether he does that voluntarily or for payment; if he is negligent or transgresses, then he is liable. End quote.</p>\n<p>Leaving the excess baggage in the airport is regarded as negligence, and you should have contacted the owner of the items and worked out an arrangement to transfer those goods and pay excess baggage fees, or left them with someone honest, or told her to come and get them, and the like.</p>\n<p>Based on that, you are liable for these goods. If you can find a replacement for them, you must replace them, otherwise you are liable for their value on the day on which they were lost.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If there was no agreement between you regarding payment for transporting the luggage, this means that you were doing it voluntarily, and you have no right now to demand payment.</p>\n<p>Anyone who carries luggage for someone else, or does work for him without a prior agreement on payment is doing it voluntarily, so he has no right to demand payment, unless that is his work which he does for a living, such as porters in the airport and the like. They are to be paid, even if there was no prior agreement.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Kashshaf al-Qina‘</em> (4/206):</p>\n<p>Whoever does work for someone else without prior agreement on fees is not entitled to anything. That is because he offered his help without stipulating anything, so he is not entitled to any payment. That is so that no one will be obliged to pay anything that he did not commit to pay. This applies if the one who offered his help was not offering to do something that he does for a living. If he does do that for a living – such as sailors, porters, cuppers, fullers, tailors, real estate agents and so on, and such as those who measure and weigh things, and the like, who earn their living by doing these things – and the owner gives him permission to do that work, then he is entitled to the same wage as his peers, because that is what is customary.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>Based on that, you are not entitled to payment, because there was no prior agreement to that effect.</p>\n<p>You should seek reward with Allah for what happened to you, for the reward with Allah for righteous deeds will not be lost.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is the knowledge that will benefit a person after death?",
      "question": "<p>What is the knowledge that will benefit a person, that is referred to in the hadith “When the son of Adam dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three…”? Does that refer only to Islamic knowledge, or can it be extended to beneficial worldly knowledge? I have a doctorate, and by His grace, Allah has granted me considerable knowledge in various fields, in physics, astronomy, mathematics and other subjects. I want to set up a website to make a series of video lectures on these subjects, so that high school and university students can benefit from them, for free, and to help them in pass their exams in school on the one hand, and on the other hand so that they may learn about the wonders of Allah’s creation in the universe, through astronomy, and I want to do that for the sake of Allah. Does this work come under the heading of beneficial knowledge that will benefit me after I die, or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “When the son of Adam dies, his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge…” -- Does this refers to Islamic knowledge or worldly knowledge?</p>\n<p>He replied: What appears to be the case is that the hadith is general in meaning, and for any knowledge that is beneficial, he will attain reward. But first and foremost among that is Islamic knowledge. If we assume that a person dies having taught some people a permissible kind of craft or manufacturing, and what he taught was beneficial, then he will attain reward and will be rewarded for that.</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqaa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (117/16).</p>\n<p>Moreover, what you plan to do by setting up this website is something good and beneficial, in sha Allah, and undoubtedly learning these things is useful and beneficial for the ummah. In fact, they come under the heading of communal obligations, as there must be among the ummah those who meet its needs in various fields.</p>\n<p>If we add to that your desire to make difficult things easy for your brothers, and help them in their studies, then that will increase your reward with Allah, if you are sincere towards Allah, may He be exalted, in your intention when doing such things. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“So whoever does an atom’s weight of goodwill see it,</p>\n<p>And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it”</p>\n<p>[az-Zalzalah 99:6-7].</p>\n<p>And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever removes a worldly hardship from a believer, Allah will remove one of the hardships of the Day of Resurrection from him. Whoever grants respite to (a debtor) who is in difficulty, Allah will grant him relief in this world and in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals (the fault of) a Muslim in this world, Allah will conceal him (his faults) in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will help a person so long as he is helping his brother. Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make a path to Paradise easy for him…” Narrated by Muslim (2699).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on wiping the left ear before the right ear when doing wudu",
      "question": "<p>A long time ago, maybe several months ago, when I was doing wudu, I wiped my left ear before the right ear, and I did not realise until today. What is the ruling on my prayer? Please note that I wash my right hand before my left hand, and my right foot before my left foot, but I was not paying attention and forgot that when washing my ears.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The authentic hadiths indicate that the way to wipe the ears when doing wudu is to wipe both of them at the same time. Abu Dawud, 135, narrated that a man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, how should I purify myself? He called for water in a vessel, and washed his hands three times, then he washed his face three times, then he washed his forearms three times, then he wiped his head, and he put his index fingers into his ears and wiped the outside of his ears with his thumbs and wiped the inside of his ears with his index fingers, then he washed his feet three times each. Then he said: “This is how wudu is to be done, and whoever does more or less then this has done wrong.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud.</p>\n<p>Starting on the right when doing wudu applies to the hands and feet only; in the case of the ears, the Sunnah is to wipe them both at the same time.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Our companions said: He should wipe the ears at the same time, and not wipe the right ear first. However, if he is one-handed, he should wash the right ear first. Ar-Ruwayani narrated a different view, which is that it is recommended to start with the right, but this is an odd and wrong view.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Majmu`, 1/444.</p>\n<p>It says something similar in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah, 1/9.</p>\n<p>But if the person who is doing wudu wipes one of his ears before the other, whether he starts with the right or the left, he has gone against the Sunnah and gone against what is better, but his wudu is valid.</p>\n<p>Al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: However he wipes his ears is valid, like the head, but what is prescribed in the Sunnah is to wipe them both by putting the index fingers in the ear and wiping the outside of the ear with the thumbs.</p>\n<p>End quote from Kashshaf al-Qina`, 1/101.</p>\n<p>We stated previously in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/115246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">115246</a> that if someone omits to wipe his ears when doing wudu, his wudu is valid. So if someone wipes his ears but he goes against the Sunnah in the manner in which he wipes them, it is more appropriate to say that his wudu is valid.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The text of the hadeeth referred to in the question is as follows:</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Jubayr ibn Mut‘im said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me: “O Jubayr, when you set out on a journey, would you like to be the best of your companions in appearance and quantity of provisions?” I said: Yes, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you. He said: “Recite these five soorahs: ‘Qul ya ayyuhal kaafiroon’ [al-Kaafiroon 109], ‘Idha ja’a nasr Allahi wal fath’ [al-Nasr 110], Qul Huwa Allahu ahad [al-Ikhlaas 112], Qul a‘oodhi bi rabbi’l-falaq [al-Falaq 113] and Qul a‘oodhu bi raabi’n-naas [an-Naas 114]. Start your recitation by saying Bismillah ir-Rahmaan ir-Raheem and end your recitation by saying Bismillah ir-Rahmaan ir-Raheem.” Jubayr said: I was rich and had a great deal of wealth, and I used to set out with whomever Allah willed I should set out with on a journey, and I would be the worst of them in appearance and the least in terms of provisions. From the time the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) taught me it, I have never stopped reciting them, and I am one of the best of them in appearance and have the most provisions, until I come back from my journey.</p>\n<p>This was narrated by Abu Ya‘la in his Musnad, 13/339, hadeeth no 7419.</p>\n<p>This is a da‘eef (weak) hadeeth; its isnaad includes unknown narrators.</p>\n<p>Al-Haythami said concerning it in Majma‘ az-Zawaa’id (10/134): (Its isnaad) includes people who I do not know.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Albaani said concerning it in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah (6963): (it is) munkar.</p>\n<p>Based on that, it is not valid to quote this hadeeth as evidence to suggest that it is mustahabb to recite any soorahs of the Quran before travelling.

Hence women are commanded to cover their heads when praying, although they are allowed to uncover their heads in front of their mahrams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to adorning oneself for prayer, it is something that is additional to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/43\" target=\"_blank\">covering the ‘awrah</a> , and it is based on the Quran, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus. In the Quran, there is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31], which Allah revealed because the disbelievers used to circumambulate the Ka’bah naked. Every place of prostration is a mosque (masjid), and this indicates that covering oneself for prayer and tawaf is what is meant by adorning oneself to worship Allah. Hence the word adornment is used rather than the word covering, to demonstrate that what is meant is that a person should adorn himself and not limit it to simply covering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the Sunnah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept the prayer of any woman who menstruates except with a head covering.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to scholarly consensus, Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars unanimously agreed that a free, adult woman must cover her head when she prays, and that if she prays with her entire head uncovered, then she must repeat the prayer. Others also narrated that there was consensus that covering is an essential condition.” (Sharh al-‘Umdah, 4/258, 259)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_we_pray_in_half_sleeves_or_bare-headed\">Can we pray in half sleeves or bare-headed?</span></h3>\n<p>Once this is understood, although the worshipper must adorn himself for prayer, this adornment may vary from one country to another, according to their customs, including what is mentioned in the question, which is praying in a garment with half-sleeves or praying bare-headed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the custom of that land is that the best adornment is to cover the head or to pray in a garment with full sleeves, then praying when one is dressed as mentioned in the question is contrary to what Allah has enjoined, even if the prayer itself is valid. But if the custom of the people in that country is to dress as described in the question, then there is nothing wrong with praying dressed in this manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the ruling also varies according to variations in the dress itself. The garment may have short sleeves and that may be customarily worn in some countries where it may be worn as an adornment, or a man may go to work in it and so on. In that case there is nothing wrong with praying in it. Or it may be the custom that this is not a kind of adornment, and it is something that a man wears at home only, or when sleeping only, in which case it is not appropriate to pray in it.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Scholarly_views_on_praying_while_not_wearing_anything_on_his_head\">Scholarly views on praying while not wearing anything on his head</span></h3>\n<p>There follow the fatwas of the scholars, which include the principle mentioned above, which is that this ruling depends on the customs in each country.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: an imam leads the people in prayer and he is not wearing anything on his head. What is the ruling on that?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with that, because the head is not part of the `awrah, rather what is required is to pray in a lower and upper garment, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should pray in a single garment with no part of it over his shoulders.” But if he wears his adornment and dresses fully, that is preferable, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raaf 7:31]</p>\n<p>But if he is in a country where it is not customary to cover the head, then there is nothing wrong with leaving it bare.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/405, 406)&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He was also asked: Is it permissible to pray without a turban? Is it permissible for the imam who is leading the people in prayer to pray without a head cover? Is the taqiyyah (kufi, skull-cap) sufficient?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/155330\" target=\"_blank\">praying without a turban</a> because the head is not ‘awrah, and it is not obligatory to cover it whilst praying, whether one is praying as an imam, praying alone or following an imam. But if wearing a turban is customary then it is better to do it, especially when praying with other people, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31] and this is part of adornment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that men who are in ihram pray bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads whilst in ihram. Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with praying bareheaded.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/406)&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"Ibn ‘Umar said to his freed slave Nafi’: “Do you go and meet people bareheaded?” He said: “No.” He said: “Allah has more right that you should be modest before Him.” This indicates that it is better to cover the head, but if we apply the words of Allah - (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying” [al-A’raf 7:31] – to this issue, we will see that covering the head is better among people who regard covering the head as a kind of adornment. But if we are among people who do not regard that as a kind of adornment, we do not say that covering it is better or that leaving it bare is better. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray in a turban, and the turban is a head covering.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/166)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more, please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69855\" target=\"_blank\">69855</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/103431\" target=\"_blank\">103431</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Qiyam in Ramadan out of faith and in hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (37) and Muslim (759)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_Prophet_Muhammad_prayed_Qiyam_al-layl\">How Prophet Muhammad prayed Qiyam al-layl</span></h3>\n<p>The best of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/143240\" target=\"_blank\">Qiyam</a> is that which is in accordance with the way the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did it, which is praying eight rak`ahs, making them beautiful and long, then praying Witr with three rak`ahs. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet did not pray more, in Ramadan or at any other time, than eleven rak`ahs. He would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were. Then he would pray three. (Narrated by al-Bukhari (2013) and Muslim (738)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Minimum_number_of_rakahs_for_Tahhajud\">Minimum number of rak`ahs for Tahhajud</span></h3>\n<p>The minimum number of rak`ahs for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50070\" target=\"_blank\">Qiyam</a> is two; there is no maximum limit for it, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari (472) and Muslim (749) from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, who said: A man asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he was on the pulpit: What do you say about the night prayers [Qiyam]? He said: Two [rak`ahs] by two, then when you fear that dawn is about to break, pray one [rak`ah] and that will make what you have prayed odd-numbered.”</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (1451) and Ibn Majah (1335) narrated that Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wakes up at night and wakes his wife, and they pray two rak`ahs together, they will be recorded among the men and women who remember Allah much.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Sahih Abi Dawud</em>)</p>\n<p>This hadith indicates that Qiyam al-layl may be done with two rak`ahs.</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (1398) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Qiyam reciting ten verses will not be recorded as one of the heedless. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one hundred verses will be recorded as one of the devout. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one thousand verses will be recorded as one of the&nbsp;<em>muqantirin</em>.”</p>\n<p>Al-Mundhiri said in at-Targhib wa't-Tarhib: “The phrase “one of the muqantirin” means: one of those for whom will be decreed a qintar [huge amount] of reward, starting from the Surah&nbsp;<em>Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk</em>&nbsp;[i.e., Surat al-Mulk] until the end of the Quran, one thousand verses. And Allah knows best.”</p>\n<p>Some of the jurists said: “The minimum for Qiyam is eight rak`ahs.”</p>\n<p>And some of them said that it means spending [the entire] night or most of it in prayer.</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;<em>ad-Durr al-Mukhtar</em>: “The minimum for the night prayers, according to what it says in&nbsp;<em>al-Jawharah</em>, is eight [rak`ahs].”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abidin said in his commentary on&nbsp;<em>ad-Durr al-Mukhtar</em>&nbsp;(2/25): &nbsp;“With regard to the words “The minimum for the night prayers, according to what it says in&nbsp;<em>al-Jawharah</em>, is eight [rak`ahs]”, the reason why he said “according to what it says in&nbsp;<em>al-Jawharah</em>” is because in&nbsp;<em>al-Hawi al-Qudsi</em>&nbsp;he said: He may pray whatever he is able to, even if it is only two [rak`ahs], but the Sunnah in [Qiyam al-layl] is to pray eight rak`ahs with four taslims. End quote. … He also said in it: This is based on the fact that the minimum the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed in tahajjud was two rak`ahs, and the maximum he prayed was eight rak`ahs, quoting from what is mentioned in&nbsp;<em>al-Mabsut</em>&nbsp;by as-Sarkhasi. Then, to support his shaykh, al-Muhaqqiq ibn al-Humam, he quoted the hadiths which prove what his shaykh specified in&nbsp;<em>al-Mabsut</em>&nbsp;and the hadith of Abu Dawud which proves that the minimum that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed in tahajjud was four rak`ahs, apart from <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/46544\" target=\"_blank\">the three rak`ahs of Witr</a> .</p>\n<p>But towards the end, he narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wakes up at night and wakes his wife, and they pray two rak`ahs together, they will be recorded among the men and women who remember Allah much.” Narrated by an-Nasai, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban in his&nbsp;<em>Sahih</em>, and al-Hakim. Al-Mundhiri said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.”</p>\n<p>I say: we should say that the minimum for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/216236\" target=\"_blank\">tahajjud</a> is two rak`ahs, the medium is four, and the maximum is eight. And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah</em>&nbsp;(1/112) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Among them [the prayers] is Qiyam al-layl, as is mentioned in&nbsp;<em>al-Bahr ar-Raiq</em>. The maximum that [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] prayed in tahajjud was eight rak`ahs and&nbsp; the minimum was two rak`ahs. This is what it says in&nbsp;<em>Fath al-Qadir</em>, quoting from&nbsp;<em>al-Mabsut</em>.”</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>al-Fawakih al-Dawani</em>&nbsp;(1/201) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In the case of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), tahajjud was obligatory, because of the report narrated by al-Bayhaqi: “There are three things which are obligatory for me and voluntary for you: tahajjud, which is Qiyam al-layl, Witr, and Duha.” The minimum of what was obligatory for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of that was two rak`ahs.”</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>al-Mawsu‘ah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em>&nbsp;(14/88) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The jurists are unanimously agreed that the minimum is two brief rak`ahs, because of the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you gets up to pray at night, let him start his prayer with two brief rak`ahs.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-‘Ayni said in&nbsp;<em>‘Umdat al-Qari</em>&nbsp;(1/228):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Does the phrase “Whoever spends Laylat al-Qadr in prayer” mean that one is required to stay up all night, or could it be sufficient to do the minimum that may be called Qiyam (voluntary prayer at night)?</p>\n<p>I say: The minimum is sufficient, and this is the view of some leading scholars, to the extent that it was said that the obligatory prayer of ‘Isha is sufficient to include a person as having prayed Qiyam. But what appears to be the case according to custom is that it cannot be said that someone prayed Qiyam unless he stayed up for the entire night, or most of it.”</p>\n<p>The correct view is what we have noted above, which is that praying Qiyam may be achieved by praying&nbsp;two rak`ahs.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_pray_Qiyam_as_one_rakah\">Can you pray Qiyam as one rak`ah?</span></h3>\n<p>There is a report which indicates that the minimum of Qiyam is one rak`ah, but it is not sahih.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to pray at night, and he urged us to do that to the extent that he said: “You should offer voluntary prayer at night, even if it is only one rak`ah.” (Narrated by at-Tabarani in&nbsp;<em>al-Kabir</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>al-Awsat</em>)</p>\n<p>This report was classed as weak by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Da‘if at-Targhib</em>&nbsp;<em>wa’t-Tarhib</em>&nbsp;(365).</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I mentioned Qiyam al-layl, and some of them said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Half of it, or one third of it, or one quarter of it, the time between two milkings of a she-camel, or the time between two milkings of milking a ewe.” (Narrated by Abu Ya‘la, classed as weak by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Da‘if at-Targhib wa't-Tarhib</em>&nbsp;(364)</p>\n<p>“the time between two milkings of a she-camel” – that was because they would milk the she-camel, then leave her for a while to allow the calf to suckle, so she would begin to produce more milk.” (<em>Fayd al-Qadir</em>&nbsp;(6/173)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_Witr_part_of_Qiyam_al-layl\">Is Witr part of Qiyam al-layl?</span></h3>\n<p>It should be understood that Witr does not come under the heading of Qiyam al-layl, so it cannot be understood from the fact that it is valid to pray Witr with one rak`ah, that the minimum for Qiyam is one rak`ah too.</p>\n<p>It says in&nbsp;<em>Kashshaf al-Qina‘</em>&nbsp;(5/23): <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/52875\" target=\"_blank\">Is Witr part of Qiyam al-layl or something else?</a> There are two possibilities, the most likely which is the second, which is that Witr is not part of Qiyam al-layl, because of the hadith quoted by Ibn ‘Aqil: “Witr, tahajjud and two rak`ahs of Fajr.” Shaykh Taqiy ad-Din said: Here our companions differentiated between Witr and Qiyam al-layl.”</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Strive_hard_to_offer_Qiyam_al-laylnbsp\">Strive hard to offer Qiyam al-layl&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>It is no secret <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3749\" target=\"_blank\">Qiyam al-layl requires effort and preparation</a> , especially in Ramadan, and the more prayers a person does, the greater his reward will be, because for every prostration Allah will raise the person one degree in status.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (488) narrated that Ma‘dan ibn Abi Talhah al-Ya‘muri said: I met Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and said: Tell me of a deed that I may do, by which Allah may admit me to Paradise – or he said: Tell me of the most beloved of deeds to Allah. He remained silent. I asked him (again) and he remained silent. I asked him a third time and he said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that and he said: “You should prostrate to Allah a great deal, for you will not perform one prostration to Allah but Allah will raise you one degree in status thereby and erase one sin for you.” Ma’dan said: Then I met Abu’l-Darda and asked him (the same question), and he said the same as Thawban had said to me.</p>\n<p>It is most unfortunate for a person to limit himself to doing two rak`ahs, except for a serious reason that may happen on some nights, such as if he is too tired, or too busy doing work that prevents him from praying and he is unable to delay the work until another time when he is free. But when one is able to do it and is free, not praying more may be indicative of weak resolve, or it may be a sign of carelessness and weak faith.</p>\n<p>So strive hard and persist, make your intention sincerely for the sake of Allah Alone, and strive against your self which is inclined to be lazy; push yourself to do acts of worship until it becomes easy for you to do them.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide and help us and you.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It is not permissible for the Muslims to engage in any kind of gambling at all, whether the money collected from gambling is to spend on charitable projects or otherwise, because it is evil and forbidden, as indicated by the general meaning of the evidence, and because the earnings derived from gambling are among the kinds of earnings which we must avoid and beware of. And Allah is the Source of strength.” &nbsp; (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/442)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_take_part_in_lotteries\"><strong>Can you take part in lotteries?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin was asked:</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on taking part in <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98151\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lotteries</a> , which means that a person buys a ticket and if he is lucky he gets a lot of money, knowing that this person intends to use that money for Islamic projects and to help the mujahidin so that they will benefit from that?</p>\n<p>He answered:</p>\n<p>“What the questioner describes, where a person buys a ticket then if he is lucky – as he says – he gets a lot of money, comes under the heading of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gambling</a> , of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, etc.), and Al Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.</p>\n<p>Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So, will you not then abstain?</p>\n<p>And obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of even coming near to drinking or gambling or Al Ansab, or Al Azlam) and fear Allah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way” [al-Maidah 5:90-91]</p>\n<p>This gambling – which is any transaction in which a person may win or lose, and he does not know whether he will be a winner or a loser – is all haram. Indeed, it is one of the major sins, and its abhorrent nature is no secret when one realizes that Allah mentions it in conjunction with idol-worship, alcohol and azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision). Whatever benefits may be hoped for from gambling pale into insignificance beside the harm that it causes. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“They ask you (O Muhammad) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.’” [al-Baqarah 2:219]</p>\n<p>Think about this verse, where benefits are mentioned in the plural, and sin is mentioned in the singular. Allah did not say, “In it are many sins and (some) benefits for men”, rather He said (interpretation of the meaning): “a great sin”. This is an indication that the benefits, no matter how numerous they may be, are insignificant when compared with this great sin; the great sin far outweighs them. So its sin is greater than its benefits, no matter what they are. &nbsp;(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/441)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_gamble_occasionally\"><strong>Can you gamble occasionally?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>With regard to a person’s saying that he only gambles occasionally, this is like one who says that he only commits adultery occasionally, or he only steals occasionally, or he only lies occasionally. Does the fact that he commits that haram action only rarely mean that it is not a sin and that he is not exposed to the wrath of Allah? How does he know that this rare action will not develop into something that is done more frequently, until it becomes a habit? In fact this is what usually happens, especially in the case of those who are afflicted by gambling. He should fear Allah and abstain from that which Allah has forbidden to him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
