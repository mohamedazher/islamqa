      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on kissing the cover of the Ka’bah, the Black Stone and the Mus-haf?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Kissing any place on earth is bid’ah (an innovation), apart from the Black Stone. Were it not that this is following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), kissing the Black Stone would be bid’ah too. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say: “I know that you are only a stone and can neither cause harm nor bring benefit. Were it not for the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed you, I would not have kissed you.” Hence it is not permissible to kiss the covers of the Ka’bah or its stones, or the Yemeni Corner, or the Mus-haf, or to touch them with the intent of seeking blessing from them .&nbsp;</p>\n",

If he wants to ask the person who was originally           guaranteed, he has the right to do so, and if he wants to ask the guarantor,           he has the right to do that too.

      "title": "The Jews’ attempts to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)",
      "question": "<p>I have heard the following: that the Jews tried to kill the Messenger 3 times. And the last time was 6 years before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, with poisoned mutton, of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate two mouthfuls, then Allaah caused the sheep to speak and tell the Messenger that it was poisoned. When the Messenger died, he said that it was as if he could taste that mutton. Is this true? If it is true, then it means that we have a great score to settle with them.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Jews wanted to kill the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) on several occasions, including the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – When he was a child. Ibn Sa’d narrated in al-Tabaqaat, with an isnaad going     back to Ishaaq ibn ‘Abd-Allaah that when the mother of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him to the Sa’di woman     who breastfed him, she said to her, “Keep him safe,” and she told her what she had seen. Haleemah al-Sa’diyyah passed by some Jews and said, “Will     you not tell me about this son of mine? I conceived him in such and such a manner, and I gave birth to him in such and such a manner, and I saw     such and such,” and she repeated what his mother had told her. They said to one another, “Kill him!” They asked her, “Is he an orphan?” She said,     “No, this is his father and I am his mother.” They said, “If he had been an orphan we would have killed him.” Haleemah (his wet nurse) took him     and said, “I nearly lost that which had been entrusted to me.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This report is mursal, but the men of its isnaad are thiqaat (trustworthy).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – They tried to kill him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after     Badr. Banu al-Nadeer sent for him to come out to them with thirty of his companions, and said “We will send out thirty of our rabbis, to meet in     such and such a place, halfway between us and you, so that they can listen to you. If they believe in you then we will all believe in you.” Then     they said: “How can we reach an understanding when there are sixty of us? Send out three of your companions and we will send out three of our     scholars to listen to you. They were carrying concealed daggers and they wanted to kill the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him). A sincere woman from among Banu al-Nadeer sent word to her nephew (her brother’s son) who was a Muslim man from among the     Ansaar, and told him about that, and he told the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) went back, and the following day he brought his troops and besieged them, and the Jews of Banu al-Nadeer were expelled.     This story was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his Musannaf, and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (3004), via ‘Abd al-Razzaaq, but he does     not mention the details of the story, rather he says, “… ‘They will listen to you and if they believe in you, we shall believe in you.’ The     narrator then narrated the whole story. When the next day came, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out     in the morning with an army, and besieged them.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Ibn Ishaaq mentions another reason for the expulsion of Banu al-Nadeer, which is that the     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to Banu al-Nadeer to ask them for help in paying the diyah of two men of ahl     al-dhimmah who had been killed by mistake by ‘Amr ibn Umayyah al-Dumari. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat by a     wall belonging to Banu al-Nadeer, and they plotted to throw a rock on him and kill him. The Revelation informed him of that and he rushed back to     Madeenah, then he issued orders that they should be besieged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – Then came the poisoning incident, after the conquest of Khaybar. Al-Bukhaari     (2617) and Muslim (2190) narrated from Anas that a Jewish woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     with some poisoned mutton. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate from it, then he asked her about that. She     said, “I wanted to kill you.” He said, “Allaah would not let you do that.” They said, “Shall we kill her?” He said, “No.” He said, I can still see     the effect of that on the palate of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said: It is as if the poison still left some trace of blackness etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The name of this woman was Zaynab bint al-Haarith, the wife of Salaam ibn Mashkam,     one of the leaders of the Jews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reports differ as to whether or not she was killed. It seems that the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not kill her at first, but when Bishr ibn al-Bara’ ibn Ma’roor died as a result of the     effects of this food, then he executed her as a qisaas punishment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Al-Bukhaari (5777) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said:&nbsp; When Khaybar was conquered,     a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) said, “Let all the Jews who have been here, be assembled before me.” The Jews were gathered and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something?” They replied, “Yes.” He asked, “Have you     poisoned this sheep?” They said, “Yes.” He asked, “What made you do that?” They said, “We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would     have got rid of you, and if you are a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to feel ill     because of this food, and he would be treated with cupping for that. </p>\n<p>Ahmad (2784) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a Jewish woman sent a gift to the     Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of a poisoned roasted sheep. He sent for her and asked her, “What made you do     what you did?” She said, “I wanted to see if you were a Prophet, then Allaah would tell you about it, and if you were not a Prophet the people     would be rid of you.” Whenever the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) felt ill as a result of that he would have     himself treated by cupping. On one occasion he traveled and when he entered ihraam he felt ill as a result of that and he had himself treated by     cupping. The editor of al-Musnad classed it as saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That had an impact in causing his death, so he  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) died as a martyr (shaheed), as Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If I were to swear by Allaah nine times that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was killed, that is more beloved to me than swearing once, because Allaah made him a Prophet and made him a     martyr.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3617. The editors said, its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sindi said: The words “he was killed” mean by the poison in the meat of the     sheep’s foreleg that he ate, when the effects of that appeared when he was dying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Quoted from Haashiyat al-Musnad, 6/116.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh, in a mu’allaq report, and al-Haakim     narrated in his Mustadrak in a mawsool report, that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet  (peace and blessings     of Allaah be upon him) used to say, in the illness which would be his last, ‘O ‘Aa’ishah, I still feel the pain of the food that I ate in Khaybar,     and this time I feel that my aorta is being cut from that poison.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aorta is the vein that is towards the back and is connected to the heart; if     it is cut then the person will die.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The conquest of Khaybar took place in Muharram or Rabee’ al-Awwal of the year 7     AH. So this event took place four years before the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is in addition to the recorded crimes of the Jews which know no limit in     ancient or modern times. The enmity between us and them will last until we fight them and kill them at the end of time, as the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Yahood fi’l-Sunnah al-Mutahharah, by Dr. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Naasir     al-Shaqaari; Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/279&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Charity given during one's lifetime is better",
      "question": "<p>Is it better for a person to give charity when he is alive, or can he write in his will that it is to be given after he dies?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The virtue of giving in charity whilst one is in good health:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, which charity brings a greater reward?” He said, “If you give in charity when you are healthy and miserly, fearing poverty and hoping for richness. Do not delay until you are at the point of death and you say, ‘Give this to So and so, give this to So and so,’ …” (al-Bukhaari, 1330; Muslim, 1713).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Al-Khattaabi said: what this hadeeth means is that miserliness is more likely when one is in good health, so if a person is miserly but he still gives in charity, his intention is more sincere and his reward will be greater, unlike the one who is facing death and no longer has any hope of living. Then he starts to realize that someone else will take his wealth, so his charity in this case is lacking, when compared with charity given when one is in good health. Stinginess is based on the hope of remaining alive and fear of poverty… so a person does not have as much reward for his will, compared to the reward for charity given by one who is healthy and miserly.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The hadeeth indicates that paying off debts and giving in charity during one's lifetime when one is in good health is better than doing so after death or when one is sick. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to that when he said: ‘When you are in good health and being cautious, hoping to be rich…’ because when a person is in good health it is usually harder for him to give money, because the Shaytaan makes him fear for it and makes attractive to him the idea that he may live a long life and need that money, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty’[al-Baqarah 2:268]</p>\n<p>The Shaytaan may also make attractive the idea of being unfair in one's will or revoking it altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the Salaf said of some wealthy people: “They disobey Allah with regard to their wealth twice, by being stingy with it when it is in their hands – i.e., during their lifetime, and by being extravagant with it when it is no longer in their hands – i.e., after death.” Al-Tirmidhi narrated with a hasan isnaad, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, that Abu’l-Dardaa’ said in a marfoo’ report: “The likeness of the one who frees slaves and gives in charity when he is dying is that of a person who gives his food away after he has eaten his fill.” This is similar to the hadeeth quoted above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood narrated a marfoo’ hadeeth from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, which says: “If a man were to give one dirham in charity when he is alive and in good health, that is better for him than giving one hundred when he is dying.”.</p>\n",

Allah has prescribed two festivals or ‘Eids for us to celebrate, and it is not permissible for us to celebrate any others. (Please see question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/486\" target=\"_blank\">486</a> ).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_it_permissible_to_celebrate_Mawlid_al-Nabi_Prophet_Muhammadrsquos_birthdaynbsp\">Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday)?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to celebrating the day on which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born, it should be noted that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell us to celebrate this day, and he himself (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not celebrate it, nor did his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They loved the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) far more than we do, yet despite that they did not celebrate this day. Hence we do not celebrate this day, in obedience to the command of Allah Who has commanded us to follow the commands of His Prophet. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).”</b> [al-Hashr 59:7]</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: <b>“I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah [way] and the way of the Rightly-Guided khalifas. Adhere to it and cling tightly to it. And beware of newly-invented matters [in religion], for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray.”</b> (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Sunnah, 3991; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, no. 3851).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The extent to which a person loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to be seen in how he follows him with regard to all that he commanded or forbade. That includes following him in not celebrating the day on which he was born.

But the people of the     village should not oblige a poor person to give them gifts like those that they gave to him, rather what is prescribed in sharee’ah is for the     Muslim to give a gift and not expect something back in return, rather he should hope for the reward from Allaah.

      "answer": "<p>The majority of scholars assert that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36793\" target=\"_blank\">witr prayer is a confirmed sunnah</a> that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) practiced consistently, and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith regarding the Bedouin who once came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asking about Islam, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) answered, \"Five prayers within one day-and-night.\" The Bedouin asked, \"Am I obliged to other than those?\" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, \"(not) Unless you volunteer of your own.\" (Agreed upon)</p>\n<p>Some scholars have said that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/279251\" target=\"_blank\">qiyam al-layl</a> (prayer at the heart of night) and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/46544\" target=\"_blank\">witr prayer</a> are the best of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/33779\" target=\"_blank\">voluntary prayers</a> .

      "title": "Should he pay zakah on shares that were given to him by the company and over which he has no control?",
      "question": "<p>I live in UK. My husband works for a company, which provides raw materials to other companies for making soaps, shampoos, cosmetics etc. For 3 years, he buys some company shares every month. The number of shares is doubled by the company for its employees.<br />\nFew days ago, when I was browsing your website, I came to know that we’ve to pay zakah on shares. We didn’t know that before.<br />\nNow I’ve some questions:<br />\n1. My husband can sell only the shares he bought with his money. The company shares can be sold only after the completion of 5 years (maturity period). Even then only the shares of first month will be mature. More shares will get matured each month. If he sells his shares now, the company shares given with those shares will be taken back from him. So, he doesn’t want to sell them now. My question is, Does he still has to give zakah on these shares?<br />\n2. Second question is, What is the nisaab of shares?<br />\n3. Third, he also has to pay tax and national insurance on these shares when he sells them. Does he have to pay zakah only on profit?<br />\n4. If we don’t have money now, can we pay it next year?<br />\n5. Do we’ve to pay for all 3 years?<br />\n6. The shares are in our joint name but only my husband deals with them, Who has the responsibility to pay zakah?<br />\nI’ll be really grateful, if you can answer me in detail, I am really concerned about the issue. I don’t want any haraam money in my home</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is obligatory to pay zakah on shares if the owner intends to sell them and they reached the nisaab (minimum threshold). He should work out their value each year, i.e., find out their market value, and pay one quarter of one tenth (2.5%) of their value.</p>\n<p>The nisaab is the equivalent of 595 grams of silver or 85 grams of gold. As silver is of lesser value, the nisaab should be worked out on the basis of silver, so as to give the poor their fair share.</p>\n<p>So if a person owns shares the value of which is equal to the value of 595 grams of silver, then he owns the minimum amount.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If a person acquires shares with the intention of benefiting from their dividends and profits, and he does not intend to sell them, then he does not have to pay zakah on the share itself; rather he has to pay zakah on the dividends, if he has taken possession of them and one zakah year has passed; he should pay one quarter of one tenth, or 2.5%, (of the dividend).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If the person does not have complete ownership of the shares, or he is not allowed to dispose of them, like the shares which the company has given to your husband, then he should pay zakah once when selling them or taking back their value, or when obtaining full possession of them by completing five years of work in that company.</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>zakah is obligatory upon the owner; if you have shares then you must pay zakah on them, and you are responsible for that, but the husband may voluntarily pay zakah on behalf of his wife.</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that taxes cannot take the place of zakah; every time one full hijri year passes, you should work out the value of the shares and pay zakah of one quarter of one tenth.</p>\n<p>With regard to the double shares, if your husband will take possession of them after five years and we said that your husband should pay zakah for one year when selling them, then he should pay zakah on what remains of their price after paying taxes and National Insurance, because in fact he does not possess anything other than that.</p>\n<p>Sixthly:</p>\n<p>If a person owns shares and works out their value at the end of the year, but he does not have cash with which to pay, it is permissible for him to delay zakah until he acquires cash or sells the shares, but he has to keep a record of that and write down what he owes of zakah for the first year, the second year and so on. But it is better to hasten to pay zakah and to be quick in doing good, and to make it easy for oneself, because if the amount of zakah accumulates, he may feel reluctant to pay it.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to bless you and to protect you from all harm.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Waswaas and suicide",
      "question": "<p>Although I observe my five daily prayers and I am practising (AlhamduliLAH) I experience serious waswas. This waswas is not normal e.g. shaytan telling me not to pray. At times I am close to commiting suicide just because of this, even though I am content and happy with what ALLAH has given me in this life. Subhan ALLAH my body moves or I am ready to jump on train tracks even though I am aware of the punishment of ALLAH to the one who commits suicide. This becomes very frighting later on when I reflect. Once I was sat on an edge/cliff and I began moving further and further towards the ocean until half my body was on the other side. AlhamduliLAH my brother pulled me and said are you crazy! I do not know what I was doing. Somthing was telling go furhter , go further. How can I overcome this fitna o brother in islam.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    You should understand that man is the one who produces his     waswaas and negative thoughts, and he is the one who causes himself to hear     these voices inside his mind. In most cases it is an echo of what he is     thinking about and the details thereof that preoccupy his mind, or it is a     reflection of the reality he is living, or it is an accumulation of past bad     experiences the effect and traces of which he has not been able to erase and     overcome (and he is still dwelling on them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But persuading yourself that you are helpless in the face of     these insinuating thoughts and that it is something beyond your control is     the most significant part of the dilemma; in fact this is one of the deepest     pits that humans in general fall into with regard to thought, reason and     contemplation. This is the difference between our father Adam (peace be upon     him) and Iblees. Adam (peace be upon him) admitted his sin, declared his     repentance, turned to Allah and was confident that he could overcome this     situation, so he and his wife said: “Our Lord! We     have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your     Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers” [al-A‘raaf 7:23].     In contrast, Iblees, may Allah curse him, blamed his Lord for his disbelief     and stubbornness, and behaved as if he was weak and helpless, unable to save     himself from the situation in which he found himself. He said, addressing     Allah (may He be glorified): “Because You have sent     me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your     Straight Path” [al-A‘raaf 7:16].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The remedy to this problem begins with realising that you are     able to deal with it and that it will be easy once you arm yourself with     resolve, determination and willpower, and follow the example of millions who     have gone through all kinds of problems and troubles, but they remained     steadfast and overcame their troubles, and became a cause of happiness for     those around them and brought development and success to their countries and     communities. You are not less significant than them and your trials are not     greater than theirs; rather it is nothing but a voice echoing inside your     mind. So let your reason be the thing that leads you and energizes you to     turn a deaf ear to these whispers, no matter how loud they are; the passage     of time will help to reduce this voice bit by bit, until it has diminished     completely, by Allah’s leave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Remember the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased     with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be     upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills     himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever.     Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the Fire of     Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have     that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for     ever and ever.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5778; Muslim, 109.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If you ponder this hadeeth you will realise the seriousness     of the matter. There is nothing standing between you and this punishment     except the barrier of death, which could come at any moment. On the other     hand, there is nothing standing between you and the promise of paradise and     eternal happiness except the same barrier. So why choose for yourself     punishment and pain; why deprive yourself of eternal bliss? The Prophet     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is closer to one     of you than the strap of his sandal, and Hell is the same.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6488.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Whatever the case, the most beneficial and most powerful     remedy for all destructive psychological problems is the wisdom that Imam     ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) learned from his experience of     life. He used to say: Pay attention to your nafs, for if you do not     preoccupy yourself with the truth it will distract you with falsehood. The     truth with which you can preoccupy yourself requires a great deal of     sacrifice from us and from you. This world is full of different kinds of     good in which you can immerse yourself, so you will hardly have any thoughts     except thoughts about doing good things, and you will not pay attention to     anything but what those good deeds require. So this will be a means of     raising your status before Allah, may He be exalted, whilst also helping you     to overcome your psychological problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Finally, we also advise you to see a doctor or psychologist,     and do not take this matter lightly. Many doctors can reduce the impact of     (negative) ideas and thinking by means of medicines that correct hormonal     imbalances in the body. Many people have benefited from treatment by     trustworthy doctors, in addition to the spiritual and Islamic advice given     above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to grant you a speedy     recovery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If someone stole some money twenty years ago, should he return the same amount of money to the owner now, even though there has been severe devaluation in the value of the currency?<br />\nIs there a difference in the ruling between loans and other kinds of debt?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If it is proven that something must be repaid because of misappropriation, theft, or delay in paying off a debt, then it must be repaid according to its value on the day it was taken, because the one who misappropriated, stole or delayed repayment is a transgressor, so he is fully liable for any harm that resulted from his transgression.</p>\n<p>But if what was stolen was a specific item, then he is liable for any resulting loss in value.</p>\n<p>With regard to other debts, it makes a difference whether the change in the value of the currency is minor or major:</p>\n<p>If the change is minor and amounts to less than one-third of the debt, then the same amount must be returned, regardless of the current value.</p>\n<p>But if the change is major, and amounts to one third or more of the value, then the matter must be rectified by splitting the difference between both parties.</p>\n<p>If the value needs to be worked out, then it should be worked out on the basis of the price of gold at the time of the debt, or according to its purchasing value at that time, then it may be paid off in a currency other than that in which the loan was made.</p>\n<p>We have discussed this matter in detail, quoting the opinions of the scholars, in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/220839/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">220839</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/99642\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">99642</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible for one who is residing in a country where the days are very long to follow the timings of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his fasting and prayers?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for one who is residing in Sweden to fast and pray in Ramadan according to the timings of Saudi, or any Arab country that is close to him, or should he follow the timings of the country where he is living?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The one who is residing in Sweden or similar countries that are located     close to the North Pole comes under one of two headings:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -1-</p>\n<p>He     is residing in a city where night and day follow one another within a     24-hour period. In this case it is not permissible for him to fast or pray     according to the timings of another city; rather he must offer the five     daily prayers at the times stipulated according to Islamic teachings,     because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be     exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Perform As-Salat     (Iqamat-as-Salat) from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e. the Zuhr,     ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’an in the early dawn     (i.e. the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’an in the early     dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the     day and the night)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:78]</p>\n<p>    “When you     have finished As-Salat (the prayer - congregational), remember Allah     standing, sitting down, and lying down on your sides, but when you are free     from danger, perform As-Salat (Iqamatas Salat). Verily, the prayer is     enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”</p>\n<p>    [an-Nisa’ 4:103].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is nothing in the verses or hadiths to differentiate between cases     where the day is long or short, so long as the timings of the prayers can be     distinguished according to the signs defined by the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for the beginning and end of the     times of the prayer. By the same token, it is obligatory for him to fast     during the day in Ramadan in full, whether the day is long or short, and it     is permissible for him to eat, drink and have intercourse during the night     that follows that day, whether the night is long or short, because Allah,     may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “and eat and     drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from     the black thread (darkness of night)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:187]</p>\n<p>    “It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your     wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts)…”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:187].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    -2-</p>\n<p>If     a person is residing in a city where night does not follow day within a     24-hour period, such as a city where the day lasts for two days, or a week,     or a month, or more than that, such as the land where the sun does not set     in the summer, and does not rise in the winter, then such people have to     offer the five daily prayers within each 24-hour period, and they have to     work out the timings of them, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah     be upon him) instructed with regard to the day of the Dajjaal that will be     like a year, and his day that will be like a month, and his day that will be     like a week. So they should work out the timings for the prayers and the     fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We     have previously explained that working out those times should be based on     the nearest city in which the timings of the obligatory prayers can be     distinguished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information on the above, please see the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/106527\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">106527</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those who issued a     fatwa stating that those who are living in a city where the day is very long     may fast according to the length of the day in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia     made an obvious mistake and went against the Qur’an and Sunnah. We do not     know of any of the scholars who issued such a fatwa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Yes, with regard to those who live in a city where night and day do not     follow one another within a 24-hour period, such as a city in which the day     lasts for two days, or a week, or a month, or longer than that, the     contemporary scholars differed as to how the time of night and day are to be     worked out in a city in which night and day last longer than twenty-four     hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of them said that they should be regarded as equal, so the night should     be regarded as twelve hours and the day should be regarded as the same,     because this is the length of each in in average terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some said that the length of night and day in Makkah and Madinah should be     followed, because they are the two cities in which the revelation came down,     so the length of night and day should be based on what is known in those     cities, if it is not known how long night and day last in any given city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some said that the length of night and day in the nearest city in which     night and day follow one another within a 24-hour period should be followed.     This view is most likely to be correct, because connecting a city to that     which is geographically closest to it is more appropriate than connecting it     to one that is far away from it, because the closest one is more likely to     resemble it than any other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (19/309)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It     is well-known that the people in those cities experience difficulty in     fasting in the summer, because of the length of the day there, but Allah     will never cause the reward of their good deeds and their patience to be     lost. The reward for acts of worship is greater when there is more     difficulty in doing it, so long as the person does not deliberately make it     difficult for himself It is narrated in a hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be     pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) said to her, when she went out for ‘umrah: “Your reward will be     commensurate with your spending or your effort.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1787) and Muslim (1211).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     a person is unable to complete the fast because the day is too long, it is     permissible for him not to fast, and to make up the days on which he did not     fast on any day of the year in which he is able to make it up, even if that     day is two or three hours, as is the case in some cities.</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If fasting is too     difficult on very long days, and is unbearably difficult, and there is the     fear of physical harm or sickness as a result, then it is permissible to     break the fast in that case, and to make it up on shorter days, because     Allah, may He be exalted, says in the context of fasting (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make     things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number     (of days), and that you must magnify Allah (i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu-Akbar;     Allah is the Most Great) on seeing the crescent of the months of Ramadan and     Shawwal) for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>    “and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship,     it is the religion of your father Ibrahim (Abraham) (Islamic Monotheism). It     is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims both before and in this (the Quran),     that the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) may     be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind! So perform As-Salat     (Iqamat-as-Salat), give Zakat and hold fast to Allah (i.e. have confidence     in Allah, and depend upon Him in all your affairs) He is your Maula (Patron,     Lord, etc.), what an Excellent Maula (Patron, Lord, etc.) and what an     Excellent Helper!”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hajj 22:78]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward     for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil)     which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into     error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those     before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater     than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have     mercy on us. You are our Maula (Patron, Supporter and Protector, etc.) and     give us victory over the disbelieving people’”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:286].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (19/309)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     the times for some of the prayers can be determined and others cannot, then     it is obligatory to offer on time those prayers for which the time can be     determined, and whatever cannot be determined should be worked out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This can be seen in Sweden and neighbouring countries, in the case of ‘Isha’     prayer, as dawn breaks before the disappearance of the red afterglow which     signals the beginning of the time for ‘Isha’ prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The correct scholarly opinion is that they must pray ‘Isha’, and work out     the time for it, in contrast to some of the Hanafi scholars who said that it     is waived because the reason for it, namely the time, is not present. Please     see Maraaqi al-Falaah (p. 73)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In    Haashiyat ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ it says: If the sign for its onset is not     present and cannot be seen, as in Bulgaria, he is still obliged to offer     both of them. So he should work out the time for it, as it will be worked     out during the days of the Dajjaal, because it is proven in Saheeh Muslim     that (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) said: “Work it     out…” as-Sarkhasi and al-Balqaani issued fatwas stating that it will be     waived in their case, but others issued fatwas saying that it is still     obligatory, which is the correct view, by analogy with the days of the     Dajjaal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Haashiyat ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (1/468)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a city     in which the disappearance of the red afterglow, which signals the beginning     of the time for ‘Isha’, is very late, and it is difficult for them to wait     for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He     replied: If the red afterglow does not disappear until dawn breaks, or it     disappears for a length of time that is not enough to pray ‘Isha’ before     dawn breaks, then these people come under the same ruling as those who do     not have a time for ‘Isha’. They should work out a time for it based on the     nearest city to them which does have sufficient time for ‘Isha’. And it was     said that they should work it out according to the time of ‘Isha’ in Makkah,     because it is the Mother of Cities (Umm al-Qura).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If     the red afterglow disappears a long time before dawn, allowing enough time     to pray ‘Isha’, then they must wait until it disappears. But if it is too     difficult for them to wait, then in that case it is permissible for them to     put ‘Isha’ together with Maghrib at the time of the earlier prayer, so as to     ward off hardship and difficulty, because Allah, may He be exalted, says     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make     things difficult for you”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>    “and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hajj 22:78].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In    Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be     pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) put Zuhr and ‘Asr together, and he put Maghrib and ‘Isha’ together, in     Madinah, when there was no fear and no rain. They said: What did he intend     by that? He said: He wanted not to cause any hardship for his ummah. In     other words, he did not want to cause them hardship by not putting prayers     together.</p>\n<p>    End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (12/206)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The imam got up for a third [rak‘ah] in Taraweeh, then added another [rak‘ah] to it, but there was someone behind him who was praying ‘Isha’",
      "question": "<p>I entered the mosque and they were praying qiyaam (Taraweeh), and it was the first rak‘ah. I had missed ‘Isha’ prayer, and I joined them in the first rak‘ah of Taraweeh, with the intention that I would do the first and second rak‘ahs [of ‘Isha’], then make up the remainder of the prayer. But when he finished the second rak‘ah, the imam stood up and did two more rak‘ahs, making a total of 4 rak‘ahs with one tashahhud. After the final tashahhud, he did the two prostrations of forgetfulness. My question is: is my praying ‘Isha’ in this instance a valid prayer? If it is not valid, what should I do?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to offer an obligatory prayer behind an imam who is offering a naafil prayer, and vice versa, according to the more correct scholarly view. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/153386\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">153386</a>.</p>\n<p>If the worshipper is praying ‘Isha’ behind an imam who is praying Taraweeh, then he should stand up after his imam says the tasleem and complete what remains of his prayer.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If a person prays ‘Isha’ behind (an imam who is praying) Taraweeh, that is permissible, then when the imam says the tasleem, he should stand up and complete the remaining two rak‘ahs. End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Majmoo‘ (4/168).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>What is prescribed in qiyaam al-layl (voluntary prayers at night) is to offer the prayers two [rak‘ahs] by two, because the Prophet (blessings and prayers of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayer is two [rak‘ahs] by two.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (993) and Muslim (749).</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad interpreted this hadith as meaning that that is obligatory. Hence he said that the prayer is invalid if the worshipper deliberately gets up for a third rak‘ah when praying qiyaam al-layl. Imam Ahmad said: Whoever gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in qiyaam al-layl, it is like his getting up for a third [rak‘ah] in Fajr.</p>\n<p>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/480).</p>\n<p>The majority of scholars are of the view that it is permissible to pray qiyaam al-layl four [rak‘ahs] by four, and they interpreted this hadith as either referring to what is recommended (mustahabb) and stating that that is preferable, or as meaning that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that because it is easier and lighter for the worshipper, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar stated in Fath al-Baari.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>If the imam prays three [rak‘ahs] in Taraweeh, what should he do?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>If he gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in Taraweeh by mistake, then he should sit down again; even if he has recited al-Faatihah, he should sit back down, and recite the tashahhud and the tasleem, then prostrate twice. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that if a man gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in the night prayer [qiyaam al-layl], it is as if he got up for a third rak‘ah in Fajr prayer, and it is known that if a man gets up for a third rak‘ah in Fajr prayer, he must sit back down, because Fajr cannot be offered with three [rak‘ahs], and similarly the night prayer cannot be more than two [rak‘ahs], because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are two by two.” I have heard that some imams, if they get up to pray a third [rak‘ah] by mistake and are reminded of it, they carry on and pray four [rak‘ahs]. This in fact is ignorance on their part, and is contrary to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The night prayers are two by two.” What should be done is, if a person is reminded in the night prayer or in Taraweeh, even if that is after he has started to recite [Qur’an, in the third rak‘ah], he must sit back down and recite at-tahhiyyaat, and say the tasleem, then do the two prostrations of forgetfulness, and say the tasleem again.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>Jalasaat Ramadaaniyyah.</p>\n<p>Based on that, this imam – when he remembered that this was the third [rak‘ah] – should have sat down, then done the prostration of forgetfulness at the end of his prayer.</p>\n<p>But what this imam did of making the prayer four [rak‘ahs] after getting up for a third [rak‘ah] by mistake is permissible according to some of the scholars.</p>\n<p>The Shaafa‘i scholars stated that one who gets up for a third [rak‘ah] in a naafil prayer by mistake should sit down, then do the prostration of forgetfulness.</p>\n<p>So if he decides that he wants to add something to his prayer after getting up, then the correct view in their opinion is that he should sit down, then stand up for the third [rak‘ah], so that he will have intended to do more before starting to do it.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars regarded it as permissible to form the intention of adding something to the prayer after getting up for it, and said that the worshipper does not have to sit down in that case.</p>\n<p>See: Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (1/271).</p>\n<p>Based on that, what the imam did is permissible according to some of the scholars, and if the imam does something that is permissible according to some of the scholars, based on his own ijtihad or following a scholar or thinking that it is valid, then his prayer is valid, and the one who is praying behind him must follow him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If the imam does something that in the view of the one who is praying behind him is forbidden in prayer, and it is a matter concerning which there are different views, the prayer offered behind him is valid. This is the well-known view narrated from Ahmad. He said: The reports narrated from Ahmad indicate the same thing; however, they appear to suggest that in every situation where it is certain that the imam made a mistake, then the prayer must be repeated, and when that is not certain, it does not have to be repeated. This is what is indicated by the reports and by usool al-fiqh. However, there are other scholarly views concerning this issue.</p>\n<p>Al-Ikhtiyaaraat (p. 70).</p>\n<p>Based on that, the imam’s prayer was valid, and your praying ‘Isha’ behind him was also valid.</p>\n<p>According to the view that adding to the prayer is not right in this situation, if the person praying behind him thought that it was permissible for the imam to do that, or he was unaware of the prohibition on following the imam in the additional rak‘ah, or he did that by mistake, his prayer is still valid.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

We know that the matter may appear difficult, especially for a man who represents and studies another religion, but who knows, maybe this study will be followed by a proper study of Islam which will lead to a new conviction.

      "question": "<p>I have been looking for work on the Internet for a very long time. In fact there are a lot of moneymaking websites, but most of them are prohibited because of what they involve of deceit and riba. So I decided to earn money through YouTube, then I realized that I have to connect my channel to Google AdSense, but the ads on AdSense may not all be permissible. So I decided to work with the company called freedom.tm, which belongs to YouTube Partners. What is the ruling on working with it; in other words, is the money that is collected from freedom.tm, which belongs to YouTube Partners, halal or haram?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p style=\"text-align:left\">Firstly:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">There is nothing wrong with receiving money in return for putting ads on video clips that belong to you, subject to certain conditions:</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:left\">\n<li>That the subscription to the company should be free.</li>\n<li>That the financial return should be known.</li>\n<li>That the ads should be permissible, and should not include any promotion of things that are prohibited. If they do contain anything that is prohibited, it is not permissible to accept them and publish them, because that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [Al-Ma’idah 5:2], and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him in that, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him in it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4831).</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But if you cannot control these ads, and they contain prohibited things, it is not permissible for you to deal with this company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Secondly:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">It is clear from what we have read about this company that it is possible to increase your earnings by inviting people to subscribe, which is what is called referrals. If the new members do not have to pay any subscription fee, then there is nothing wrong with you receiving commission for inviting them and their joining the company, on condition that you make sure that the people whom you choose to invite will not accept unlawful ads.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">For more details, please see the answers to questions no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101806/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">101806</a> and <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/198784/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">198784</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>      The Sunnah is for the adhaan and iqaamah for prayer is to       be given standing. This is what the people have done from the time of the       Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until the present day.       The one who gives the adhaan sitting or gives the iqaamah sitting with no       excuse has done a bad action and has gone against the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a matter on which the scholars are unanimously agreed     that there is no difference of opinion among them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/11):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is mustahabb for     the one who is reciting the iqaamah for prayer to do so standing, and it is     makrooh to do so sitting without an excuse, but if there is an excuse, there     is nothing wrong with it. … It is also makrooh to give the iqaamah whilst     walking or riding when travelling or otherwise without an excuse. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It also says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (15/264):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Giving the adhaan or iqaamah whilst sitting:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is makrooh for the     muezzin to give the adhaan whilst sitting except with an excuse, or if he is     giving the adhaan for himself, as the Hanafis and Maalikis say, because the     Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed Bilaal to     stand when he said: “Get up and give the call to prayer.” The muezzins of     the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to     give the adhaan whilst standing. And because standing makes the voice carry     further, and giving the adhaan and iqaamah whilst sitting is contrary to the     practice that has been handed down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Among the Hanbalis, Ibn Haamid said: If he gives the adhaan     whilst sitting, it is invalid. This was the view of Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen,     who said that the adhaan given by one who is sitting down is not acceptable.     And Abu’l-Baqa’ narrated that it should be repeated if he gave the adhaan     whilst sitting down.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of one who has an excuse, there is nothing wrong     with him giving the adhaan whilst sitting. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-‘Abdi     said: I saw Abu Zayd, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him), whose legs had been injured (in jihad) for the     sake of Allah, giving the adhaan whilst sitting. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Sunnah is not to walk whilst giving the iqaamah, and to     give the iqaamah in the place where one is going to pray, so that there will     not be an interval between the iqaamah and starting the prayer, and because     the iqaamah is an announcement that the prayer is about to begin. So one     should start to pray immediately after reciting the iqaamah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad said in his Masaa’il     (61/220): I said to my father: Can a man walk whilst saying the iqaamah? He     said: I like him to stay where he is. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ishaaq ibn Raahaywayh said: As for the muezzin, once he     starts to say the iqaamah, if he is the imam, he should not walk during the     iqaamah until he finishes it.

Whatever of his gifts is still present should be returned and whatever has been used up or damaged should be replaced, or its value should be given.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-Jamal al-Shaafa’i said in his commentary on Sharh Manhaj al-Tullaab (4/129): It should be returned to him if it is still present and it should be replaced if it has been used up or damaged. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam (2/220): That which was given before the marriage contract is permissible and he may take it back if it is still present; this applies to items that are usually given to be used up. But with regard to items that are not usually used up, he may ask for their value if they are damaged, unless they refuse to go ahead with the marriage, in which case he has the right to ask for its value in both scenarios. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., if they refused to give her to him in marriage, he may take back the value if they have used up what they took from him, whether the items that he gave were consumable or not. This applies to items that the sister has consumed. But what he consumed himself he has no right to ask her for its value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the man is a stranger to his fiancée and it is not permissible for him to be alone with her or to shake hands with her or go out with her.</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Brother my question is fairly long and I hope inshallah you will be able to answer it to the best of your knowledge using hadith and Quranic proof to backup what you are saying and please use as much proof as you possible can.</div>\n<div> See the problem that I am facing is regarding the way in which my parents perform Ibadah and this way that they perform it they would like me to do the same but I personally did not feel that it went in accordance with the sunnah. My parents have a sufistic Qadriyanni belief in which they belief the Prophet Mohammed S.A.W was a Noor and a human. A Sufi Alim who is a Mufti gave my dad a type of Ibadah style book written in Urdu and Dua's in Arabic he told him to do this Ibadah in particular every single day and with Your children who are able to recite Quran and your wife loudly together.</div>\n<div>The form of Ibadah goes as following before starting he told us to recite the words</div>\n<div>\"Allahumma Salliallah Muhamadin Wa'lihi Wa Itratihi beadadikuli malumilaka he refers to it as Darud Qadri</div>\n<div> then he told us to recite these words 100 times \"Subhanallahi wabihamdihi Subhanallahhilazeem Astagfirullahalazimalazi La Illaha Illa huwalhayalqayoom wa atoobu alayhi\"</div>\n<div>then he told us to recite 7 times surah fatiha  </div>\n<div>then he told us to recite 100 times   \"Allahumma Salliallah Muhamadin Wa'lihi Wa Itratihi beadadikuli malumilaka he refers to it as Darud Qadri  </div>\n<div>the he told us to recite 79 times Surah allamnashra  </div>\n<div> then recite surah Ikhlas 100 times  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times these words   \"allahuma ya qadiyal hajate  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times these words   \"allahuma ya dafi al balayati\"  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"allahuma ya ah lal mushkalati  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"allahuma ya kafiyal muhimati  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Allahuma ya mujeebadawati  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"allahuma ya shafi mar da'\"  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Allahuma ya khayranaseereena\"  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Bihrahmatikaya ya arhamarahimeen  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Allahuma ameen\"  </div>\n<div>the 2nd part to this Ibadah is the same thing accept some things changed around such as starting off with the words \"hazbunallahu\" 500 times and following it through the same way acept without Surah Allahmnashra or Ikhlas.</div>\n<div>Now I know some of these words are in the Quran and the surahs are for sure but I would like to know the meanings for everything english translation i'm sorry i cannot find it in arabic but try to soundout the meaning please. I would like to know if this form of Ibadah is in accordance with the Sunnah. If the Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W) ever recited it. My parents want me to do the Ibadah with them and they get very angry even if i question it the slightest bit because they say what do you know your so young. The alim who came has been studying for more then 60 years who are you to question them. So brother please answer my question in as much depth as possible and as much proof you can possibly have if this Dua is sunnah or just an innovation. As well i forgot to mention there is this other thing my parents want me to do after i do this supplication   which is that i recite Surah 105 in the Quran and when it gets to a part where you say tarmihim to say tarmeem and take these rocks one by one bouncing them off of a metal bowl turned upside down covered with a red sheet to represent blood. My parents tell me this is to ask allah to strike down on the enemies of ours killing them off or something close to that. I would like to know of this is the sunnah of the Prophet MOhammed (S.A.W) or if its an innovation please provide lots of proof and be as clear as possible so my parents will understand. I know I am asking for a lot but I would really appreciate if you could answer me as soon as possible.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The purpose for which we were created is to worship Allah alone with no partner or associate, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)”</p>\n<p>[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has not left us each to choose his own way of worship, rather He has sent His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and revealed His holy Book, to show people the way and guide them. So there is nothing that is worship and goodness and guidance that Allah loves, but it has been explained by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No two Muslims dispute that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best and most pious of mankind, the one who worshipped Allah and turned to Him the most. Hence the one who is truly guided is the one who follows his path and walks in his footsteps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adhering to the path of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not something that is optional, rather it is an obligation that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). And fear Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”</p>\n<p>[al-Hashr 59:7]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:36]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:21]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that every innovated kind of worship would be rejected and thrown back at the one who does it, no matter what it is. He said: “Every action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] will be rejected.” Narrated by Muslim, 1718, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No deed will be accepted unless it is done sincerely for the sake of Allah and in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“that He may test you which of you is best in deed”</p>\n<p>[al-Mulk 67:2]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: (This means) that which is most sincere and most correct. They said, O Abu ‘Ali, what most sincere and most correct? He said: If a deed is not sincere and not correct, it will not be accepted. If it is correct but is not sincere, it will not be accepted unless it is both sincere and correct. Sincere means that it is done for the sake of Allah and correct means that it is in accordance with the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever wants to attain the pleasure of Allah, he has to adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). All paths to Allah are blocked, except this path, the path of His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was compassionate towards his ummah and cared deeply for them, he did not leave anything good without explaining it to them. So whoever today invents an act of worship, dhikr or wird and claims that it is good, is accusing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – whether he realizes it or not – of not conveying the religion as Allah commanded him to do. Hence Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever introduces any innovation into Islam claiming that it is good is implying that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) betrayed the message entrusted to him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa'idah 5:3]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So whatever was not part of the religion of Islam at that point should never be part of the religion of Islam today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and imams issued many warnings against innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan said: Every act of worship which the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do, do not do it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Mas’ood said: Follow and do not innovate, for the religion is complete. Adhere to the old way (i.e., the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sahaabah)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The question which should be put to the one who invented this dhikr is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do this? Did the Sahaabah do this?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The obvious answer is that reciting these soorahs these number of times – 100 times or 7 or 79 – is something that was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or from any of his companions. The same is true of the du’aa’s recited in this manner for the number of times mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be said to this innovator: do you think that you have discovered something good that was not known to the Prophet or his companions?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Or do you think that you or your shaykh have the right to introduce new laws and to define news dhikrs and when they should be said and how often they should be repeated, just as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had that right?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly both of these are manifest misguidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let us think about the report narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood by al-Daarimi in his Sunan, according to which Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said to ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood: “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, I have just seen in the mosque something new that I was not sure about, but I think I have not seen anything but something good, praise be to Allah.” He said, “What was it?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “You will see it tomorrow.” He said, “I saw some people in the mosque sitting in circles waiting for the prayer. In every circle there was a man and in their hands were pebbles. He would say, ‘Say Allahu akbar one hundred times,’ so they would say Allahu akbar (takbeer) one hundred times. Then he would say, ‘Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (tahleel) one hundred times, so they would say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah one hundred times. Then he would say, ‘Say Subhaan Allah (tasbeeh) one hundred times,’ and they would say Subhaan Allah one hundred times.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “What did you say to them?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “I did not say anything to them. I was waiting for your opinion.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “Why did you not tell them to count their bad deeds and promise them that none of their good deeds would be lost?’ Then he went away and we went with him, until he came to one of those circles. He stood over them and said, “What is this that I see you doing?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They said, “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, these are pebbles with which we count the takbeer, tahleel and tasbeeh.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “Count your bad deeds, for I promise you that nothing of your good deeds will be lost. Woe to you, O ummah of Muhammad, how soon you have drifted into the way of doom even though the companions of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are still alive amongst you, and his garments and the vessels he used are still not worn out or broken. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, either you are following a way that is more guided than the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or you are starting a way that is the way of misguidance.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>They said, “By Allah, O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “How many of those who intend good never attain it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not everyone who seeks or intends good attains it and is guided to it. Not every act of worship is accepted, unless it is in accordance with the Sunnah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This denunciation by Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) puts an end to the argument presented by innovators, because they always say, “What reason can there be not to recite dhikr, prayers and Qur’aan? We only intend good and to draw closer to Allah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be said to them: Worship must be something that is prescribed in sharee’ah in essence and in its form and the manner in which it is done. If a specific number is prescribed in sharee’ah then no one has the right to go beyond that, and if no number or way is specified then no one has the right to invent a limit for it, because that implies that one is assuming the role of a lawgiver. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is further supported by the report narrated from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib (may Allah have mercy on him). He saw a man praying more than two rak’ahs after dawn had come (i.e., Fajr), and he told him not to do that. The man said, “O Abu Muhammad, will Allah punish me for praying?!”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “No, but He will punish you for going against the Sunnah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Look at the understanding of this great Taabi’i, may Allah have mercy on him. That is because the regular Sunnah is to pray only two rak’ahs after the dawn has come, not more than that, then to pray the obligatory prayer of Fajr.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A similar report was narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him). A man came to him and said: “O Abu ‘Abd-Allah, from where should I enter ihraam?”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;He said, “From Dhu’l-Hulayfah, from where the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered ihraam.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “I want to enter ihraam from the Mosque, from near the grave (meaning the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “Do not do that, for I fear fitnah (trial, affliction) for you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “What fitnah is that? It is just a few miles I am adding.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “What fitnah is greater than your thinking that you have found something good that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) failed to do?! I heard that Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad’s) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them’</p>\n<p>[al-Noor 24:63].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the understanding of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Imams. As for the people of bid’ah, they say, “What fitnah? It is only dhikr and prayer and a few miles by which we seek to draw closer to Allah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No wise person should be deceived by the words of these people, for the Shaytaan has made their deeds appear attractive to them, and they hate to go against their shaykhs and the leaders of their tareeqahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Bid’ah (innovation) is dearer to Iblees (Satan) than sin, because a person may repent from sin, but not from innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that no one ever invents a bid’ah but he forsakes thereby a Sunnah that is equal to it or greater than it. Hence those who favour innovated dhikrs are the most ignorant of people about the Prophet’s dhikr which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) persisted in reciting. You will rarely find any of them who says in the morning and evening, Subhaan-Allah wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to Allah) one hundred times; or Asbahna ‘ala fitrat il-Islam wa kalimat il-ikhlaas wa deeni nabiyyina Muhammad sall-Allahu ‘alay wa sallim wa millati abeena Ibraaheema haneefan wa maa kaana min al-mushrikeen (We have awoken on the fitrah of Islam and the word of sincerity and the religion of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the religion of our father Ibraaheem, pure monotheism, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah); or Asbahna wa asbah al-mulk Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen. Allahumma inni as’aluka khayra hadha’l-yawm fa-thahu wa nasrahu wa noorahu wa barakatahu wa hudaahu, wa a’oodhu bika min sharri ma fihi wa sharri ma ba’dahu (We have awoken and dominion belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah I ask You for the good of this day and its goodness, support, help, light, blessing and guidance. And I seek refuge with You from the evil of what is in it and the evil of what comes after it): or Subhaan Allah ‘adada khalqihi, Subhaan Allah ridaa nafsihi, Subhaan Allah zinata ‘arshihi, Subhaan Allah midaada kalimaatihi (Glory be to Allah the number of His creation, Glory be to Allah as much as He is pleased with, Glory be to Allah the weight of His Throne, Glory be to Allah the extent of His words).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And there are other dhikrs with which you may be content, from the books that contain the dhikrs for the morning and the evening, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The point is that it is not permissible to join your parents in these innovated dhikrs and say them the number of times you mention.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what you mentioned about Soorat al-Feel and throwing stones when saying tarmeehim (striking them), this is a myth and is nonsense. It is not permissible to do this or to seek to draw closer to Allah by doing it. How many enemies did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confront, and he did not pray against them in this manner. There is the fear that this is a way of drawing closer to the devils and seeking their help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>With regard to the belief that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was light (noor), there is no basis for this and it was not narrated either in the Qur’aan or saheeh Sunnah. Allah has told us that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a human being like us, except that Allah favoured him with revelation and the message. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</div>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God i.e. Allah)’”</p>\n<p>[al-Kahf 18:110]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allah), therefore take Straight Path to Him (with true Faith Islamic Monotheism) and obedience to Him, and seek forgiveness of Him. And woe to Al‑Mushrikoon (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah)’”</p>\n<p>[Fussilat 41:6]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the extreme Sufis believe that he was light, and that he was the first thing created by Allah, and that the rest of creation was created from his light. This is a lie and is misguidance for which they have no evidence apart from a false, fabricated hadeeth. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to help you and your parents to avoid innovation and its people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He wants to pray to Allah to let him live until he witnesses the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) at the end of time",
      "question": "<p>My question is that can i make dua so that i am able to live until i see isa peace be upon him return to earth and to see all these signs? This could strengthen my faith alot. So can is it possible for me to make dua to live this long?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with the Muslim asking his Lord to give him a long life of obedience to Him. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked: Who is the best of people? He said: “The one who lives a long life and does good deeds.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2329); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12372/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12372</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The descent of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary – peace be upon him) will happen at the end of time. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) from heaven will happen at the end of time. End quote.</p>\n<p>Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 8/234.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/43840/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">43840</a>.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>It is possible that some people of this ummah may live long enough to see him (peace be upon him); that is not impossible. Al-Haakim (8635) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you lives to see ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, let him convey greetings of salaam to him from me.” Blessings and peace of Allah be upon them both.</p>\n<p>Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (1981).</p>\n<p>Ahmad (7971) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: If I live a long life, I hope that I may live to see ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, but if death comes to me before that, then whoever lives to see him, let him convey greetings of salaam to him from me.</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad.</p>\n<p>But this possibility is one thing, and asking to witness the descent of ‘Eesa is something else. His descent will come at the end of time, as mentioned above, and the turmoil and tribulations of the end of time will be many and ongoing. The one who asks Allah to let him see him has in fact asked Allah to let him live until he sees a time of turmoil and tribulation, especially since ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will descend at the time of the Dajjaal, which will be the greatest and worst of tribulations, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Between the creation of Adam and the onset of the Hour there is no matter of greater impact than the Dajjaal.” Narrated by Muslim (2946) and Ahmad (16255).</p>\n<p>The Muslim should seek to avoid tribulations and the places and times where they occur, and ask Allah to keep him safe from them, so how about the greatest of tribulations that will have the most severe impact on people?</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (4319) narrated that ‘Imraan ibn Husayn said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjaal, let him go far away from him, for by Allah a man will come to him thinking that he is a believer, and he will follow him because of the specious arguments that he offers, or because of the specious arguments with which he is sent.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.</p>\n<p>So whoever witnesses the coming of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will also witness the coming of the Dajjaal, and the Muslim does not ask Allah to let him live to see the time of tribulation, and he is not the one who exposes himself to that. Rather he asks Allah to keep him safe from it. He does not ask for something that is unclear to him and he does not know – if he witnesses it – how he will fare in that case.</p>\n<p>Ahmad (23810) narrated that Jubayr ibn Nufayr said: We sat with al-Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad one day, and a man passed by him and said: Glad tidings to these two eyes that saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). By Allah we wish that we had seen what you saw and witnessed what you witnessed. He got angry, and I was surprised, for he had not said anything but good words. Then he turned to him and said: What makes a man wish for to be present at a time that Allah willed that he should not be, and he does not know, if he was there, how he would have fared? By Allah, people were present with and saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) whom Allah will throw on their faces in Hell. They did not respond to him and they did not believe him. Why do you not praise Allah for having been brought up knowing nothing but your Lord, believing in what your Prophet brought, and you were sufficed against trials and tests?</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad.</p>\n<p>So none of us should wish for something that he was not meant to witness, and he does not know how he would fare in that situation. Let us ask Allah to make us steadfast in adhering to Islam, and repeat often the words: “aa muqallib al-quloob thabbit qalbi ala deenak (O Controller of the hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion).”</p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>What appears to be the case is that it is not appropriate to pray to live long enough to witness the descent of ‘Eesa and see the signs that will occur at that time. Rather each of us should ask his Lord to give him a long life of obedience to Him and enable him to do righteous deeds, and let the end of his life come when he is doing such deeds.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">41017</a>.</p>\n<p>With regard to strengthening one’s faith, that may be achieved by doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, keeping away from sin and those who commit it, love of dhikr and Quran, and focusing on doing that which is right and proper.</p>\n<p>For more information on ways of strengthening faith, please see the answer to question <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/223615/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">223615</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She had a miscarriage after entering ihraam for ‘umrah of Hajj tamattu‘; can she do tawaaf, and how should she complete her Hajj?",
      "question": "<p>If a woman in the early months of pregnancy starts bleeding, and it is not regular menstrual bleeding, rather it is a miscarriage, and she is doing tamattu‘ [‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihraam in between], what should she do when she has already entered ihraam for ‘umrah? Can she do tawaf? Is her Hajj regarded as not being valid? Please note that she has come from a distant country and must return to her country by plane on a certain date, accompanied by her husband.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If a woman has a miscarriage, and that was after human features had appeared in the foetus, then the bleeding that occurs because of that is regarded as nifaas. If it happens before human features appear in the foetus, then the bleeding is regarded as istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding], which does not prevent her from praying or doing tawaaf.</p>\n<p>Human features do not appear in the foetus before eighty days of pregnancy. See the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/37784\">37784</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on that, with regard to this woman who had a miscarriage, if the miscarriage occurred before eighty days of pregnancy, then the bleeding is not nifaas; rather it is istihaadah, so it does not prevent her from praying or doing tawaaf, but she must do wudoo’ for each prayer.</p>\n<p>If the miscarriage occurred after the soul had been blown into the foetus – i.e., after one hundred and twenty days of pregnancy, then the blood is definitely nifaas.</p>\n<p>If the miscarriage occurred after eighty days and before one hundred and twenty days, then the foetus should be examined; if human features can be seen, then the bleeding is nifaas, but if there are no human features, then the bleeding is istihaadah.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If the bleeding is nifaas, and she had already entered ihraam for ‘umrah, then she cannot circumambulate the Ka‘bah (tawaaf) according to the majority of fuqahaa’; rather she must wait until she becomes pure [i.e., her nifaas ends] – even if that happens before forty days. If she does not become pure before ‘Arafah, she should enter ihraam for Hajj, and will then be doing qiraan [‘umrah followed by Hajj without exiting ihraam in between]. She should do everything that the pilgrims do, namely standing [in ‘Arafah], stoning the Jamaraat and staying overnight in Mina, but she should not do tawaaf until she becomes pure. This is the view of the majority of scholars.</p>\n<p>If she cannot stay in Makkah until she becomes pure, then she may take medicine to stop the bleeding, so that she will be able to do tawaaf when she is in a state of purity. ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq narrated in his Musannaf (1/318) that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a woman whose menstrual bleeding was lengthy in duration, and she wanted to take medicine to stop the bleeding. Ibn ‘Umar did not see anything wrong with that, and he recommended araak water [that is, he prescribed that medicine for her]. Mu‘ammar said: I heard Ibn Abi Nujayh being asked about that, and he did not see anything wrong with it.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ata’ that he was asked about a woman who was menstruating, then she was given some medicine to stop her menses before it ended naturally; could she do tawaaf? He said: Yes, if she sees the tuhr (white discharge signalling the end of menses). But if she sees traces of blood, and does not see the white tuhr, then she should not do tawaaf.</p>\n<p>What is meant by traces is a little blood or light bleeding when the menses has nearly ended.</p>\n<p>If she cannot take this medicine or she fears that she may be harmed by it, then Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that if she cannot stay in Makkah because she is part of a group that will leave soon, and she cannot come back in order to do tawaaf, then in that case she has no choice, so she should take measures to prevent the blood from falling onto the ground, and do tawaaf. Some of the scholars have issued fatwas to this effect.</p>\n<p>The Permanent Committee for Iftaa’ was asked:&nbsp; A woman came in ihram for ‘umrah, and after reaching Makkah she got her menses. Her mahram has to leave immediately and she does not have anyone in Makkah. What is the ruling?</p>\n<p>They replied: If the matter is as described, that the woman got her menses before doing tawaaf, and she is still in ihram, and her mahram has to leave immediately, and she has no mahram or husband in Makkah, then the condition of being in a state of purity and free of menses in order to enter the mosque and do tawaaf is waived in her case, out of necessity, and she should put on a sanitary pad and do tawaaf and sa‘i for her ‘umrah, unless it is easy for her to leave and then come back with her husband or mahram because she does not live too far away and it is easy for her to come back. In that case, she should leave and come back as soon as her menses ends in order to do the tawaaf of her ‘umrah in a state of purity. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>“Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>\n<p>“[Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:78]</p>\n<p>“So fear Allah as much as you are able”</p>\n<p>[at-Taghaabun 64:16].</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I instruct you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can.” And there are other religious texts which confirm that making things easy and avoiding hardship are religious objectives. What we have mentioned was also indicated in fatwas issued by a number of scholars, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student, al-‘Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them both). End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah (2/238).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: A woman got her menses when she had not done tawaaf al-ifaadah, and she lives outside the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia). The time has come for her to leave the Kingdom; she cannot delay her departure and it is impossible for her to return to the Kingdom once more. What is the ruling?</p>\n<p>He replied: If the matter is as described, a woman has not done tawaaf al-ifaadah, and she has got her menses and cannot remain in Makkah or come back to it if she leaves before doing tawaaf, then in this case she may take one of two measures: either she may have an injection to stop the bleeding, and then do tawaaf; or she may put on a sanitary pad to prevent the blood contaminating the mosque, and do tawaaf, as this is a case of necessity. The view that we have mentioned here is the most correct view, and is the one that was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. Or the other alternative is to do one of two things: either to remain in whatever state of ihram she is in, in which case she is not permissible for her husband, and it is not permissible for a marriage contract to be done with her if she is not married; or she is to be regarded as being like one who was prevented from reaching the Ka‘bah, so she should offer her sacrifice and exit her ihram. In that case, her Hajj will not count. Both of these options are difficult, so the correct view is that of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) regarding such cases of necessity. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“[Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:78]</p>\n<p>“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:185].</p>\n<p>But if this woman is able to travel then come back when she has become pure, there is nothing wrong with her leaving, then when she becomes pure (following the end of her menses), she may come back and do the tawaaf of Hajj. But during the intervening period, she cannot be intimate with her husband, because she has not completed the second stage of exiting ihram. End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah (2/237).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If this woman thinks it most likely that her bleeding will not stop before ‘Arafah, in addition to knowing that she will not be able to stay in Makkah until she becomes pure, then she should do tawaaf for ‘umrah and exit ihraam therefrom, then enter ihraam again for Hajj, and her Hajj will be valid. However, it is better for her to do what is mentioned above, namely joining Hajj to ‘umrah, so that she will be doing qiraan. It may so happen that she becomes pure one or two days after ‘Arafah, in which case she will be able to do tawaaf when she is in a state of purity.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Can Women Perform Hajj Qiran for Ease?",
      "question": "<p>A man has several elderly women with him; which is better, Tamattu` (doing Hajj and `Umrah together, exiting ihram in between) or Qiran (doing Hajj and `Umrah together, without exiting ihram in between)? Because the Qur’an waives sa`i in the case of Qiran, and it is also possible for a woman to combine Tawaf Al-ifadah and the farewell Tawaf, and that will be easier for the older women. Do you advise older women to do Tamattu` or Qiran?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, in our times it is difficult for many pilgrims, if they are doing Tamattu`, to do the Tawaf of `Umrah and the Sa`i of `Umrah, then to do the Tawaf of Hajj and the Sa`i of Hajj, then to do the Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf Al-Wada`).</p>\n<p>So some women think that they should do Qiran, so when they reach Makkah, they do Tawaf Al-Qudum (the Tawaf of Arrival), and they do one Sa`i for both Hajj and `Umrah, and they do not repeat Sa`i.</p>\n<p>In this regard, Qiran is easier than Tamattu`. It is also easier than Tamattu` from another angle,&nbsp;because if a person does Qiran, he can delay Tawaf until after he has done Hajj. In other words, it is permissible for him not to do Tawaf upon arrival and not to do Sa`i; rather he enters Ihram for Hajj and `Umrah together, then he goes out to Mina and completes Hajj, then after that he does Tawaf and Sa`i when he is able to, even if that is after the 13th&nbsp;or 14th&nbsp;or 15th&nbsp;days of Dhul-Hijjah, or at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>So Qiran is easier than Tamattu` in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The pilgrim only has to do one Tawaf and one Sa`i;</li>\n<li>The one who is doing Qiran does not have to do Tawaf or Sa`i as soon as he arrives; rather he may go out to Mina and complete Hajj, then when it is easy for him, he can do Tawaf and Sa`i.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on that, we say, if this is easier, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he chose the easier of the two, so long as it was not a sin.</p>\n<p>Qiran is not a sin; rather it is one of the ways of doing Hajj, and the one who does it does `Umrah and Hajj and also offers a sacrifice, because the one who is doing Qiran must offer a sacrifice, like the one who does Tamattu`.

You must do what Allah and His messenger tell you to, and stay away from what they tell you to. Islam does not tell you to do anything unless it is good for you. It also does not tell you to stay away from anything unless it is bad for you. You will notice the change in the way you look at things, the minute you become a Muslim. You will feel more relieved and secure only to think that you are fulfilling the orders of Allah. Doing this, you will clearly see the benefits of it for yourself and for mankind. You can embrace Islam in any Islamic center. This is only a formality. Once you say and believe in the Oneness of Allah and in the message of his Prophet Mohammad, then you are a Muslim.</p>\n<p>To become a Muslim, simply say the following words:</p>\n<p>Ash hadu alla ilaha illa Allah, wa ash hadu anna Mohammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu.</p>\n<p>This means I testify and witness that there is no god worthy of being worshipped other than Allah and that Mohammad is his Messenger.

Some scholars say     that what brings the multiple reward in al-Masjid al-Haraam is the five     daily prayers only, and other prayers do not bring the multiple reward. What     appears to be the case from the apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that it     includes all prayers, and the janaazah prayer is included in this general     meaning of the reward for prayers in al-Masjid al-Haraam being multiplied.

In that case, it is permitted for you to pray in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a Christian boy who became Muslim secretly and feared trouble for the sake of his religion if his family found out that he had become Muslim, and he is a young student in school. He does not have a place to pray and he is afraid that if they find out about him, they may send him to a non-Muslim country or try to make him give up his religion, and he is a person who cannot be steadfast because he is still young. Is it permissible for him to pray in the bathroom?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>It seems that there is nothing wrong with it if he cannot find any other place. If he prays in front of them they may find out about him and try to make him give up his religion. If he cannot find any other place then there is nothing wrong with it, but he may find another place, or he may find a place for some of the prayers and not for others. Hence if he can find another place then he has to pray there, because praying in the bathroom is not allowed, as <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140208/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it is forbidden to pray in graveyards and bathrooms</a>. But if he cannot find any other place, he should not omit the prayer. (End quote)</p>\n<p>See also the lecture: Mashakil wal-Hulul by Shaykh Munajjid.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should a traveller offer the prayers in shortened form in his house or pray in congregation in the mosque?",
      "question": "<p>If I stay in a city for a temporary period whilst travelling, is it better to offer the prayers in shortened form in my house or to offer them in complete form in congregation in the mosque?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Prayer in congregation is obligatory and it is not permissible for a Muslim not to do that unless he has an excuse. We have already quoted the evidence for that from the Quran and Sunnah. Please see question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8918\" target=\"_blank\">8918</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, you have to offer the prayers in congregation in the mosque. If the imam is a resident (is not travelling) then you should offer the prayer in full with him, and not shorten it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked: If a person travels to Jeddah, for example, is he allowed to shorten his prayers or does he have to pray with the congregation in the mosque?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the traveller is still en route, it does not matter, but if he has reached his destination then he should not pray on his own, rather he has to pray with the people and offer the prayer in full. But if he is still on the road and is alone and the time for prayer comes, there is nothing wrong with him praying on his own and shortening the prayers whilst travelling, making the four-rakah prayers two rak’ahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’iah li’l-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (12/297).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: when and how should a traveller pray?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The traveller may pray two rak’ahs from when he leaves his city or town, until he returns to it, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the prayer was first enjoined it was two rak’ahs, then the prayer of the traveller remained like that but the prayer of one who is not travelling was increased to four.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1090; Muslim, 685. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Madeenah to Makkah, and we prayed two rak’ahs each time, until we came back to Madeenah. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1081; Muslim, 693.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if a traveller prays with an imam he should pray four rak’ahs, whether he catches up with the prayer from the beginning or he misses part of it, because the general meaning of the Prophet’s words: “When you hear the iqaamah, then walk to the prayer, and you should be tranquil and dignified, and not rush. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 636; Muslim, 602. The general meaning of the phrase “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it” includes travellers who pray behind an imam who is offering a four-rak’ah prayer, and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked why a traveller should pray two-rak’ahs when he is alone and four when he prays behind a resident. He said: “That is the Sunnah.” Narrated by Muslim, 688; Ahmad, 1865. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The obligation to pray in congregation is not waived for the traveller, because Allah has enjoined that even in the case of fighting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salaah (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you…”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:102]</p>\n<p>Based on this, if the traveller is in a city or town other than his own, he has to attend prayers in congregation in the mosque if he hears the call to prayer, unless he is far away or fears that he may miss meeting up with his travelling companions, because of the general meaning of the evidence which indicates that the one who hears the adhaan or iqaamah is obliged to pray in congregation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 15/252.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was also asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I am travelling and I hear the call to prayer, do I have to pray in the mosque? If I pray in the place where I am staying, is there anything wrong with that? If the duration of my trip is more than four consecutive days, should I shorten my prayers or offer them in full?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: If you hear the adhaan when you are in the place where you are staying, then you have to attend the mosque, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who asked him for permission not to pray in congregation: “Can you hear the call?” He said, “Yes.” He said: “Then answer it.” Narrated by Muslim, 6533. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:&nbsp; “Whoever hears the call and does not come, there is no prayer for him (i.e., his prayer is not valid), except for one who has an excuse.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 217; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no evidence to indicate that this ruling applies only to the traveller, unless your going to the mosque will cause you some problems in your journey, such as if you need to rest and sleep and you want to pray in the place where you are staying so that you can sleep, or you are afraid that if you go to the mosque the imam will delay the prayer, and you want to leave and you are scared that you may miss the train or plane, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 15/422.</p>\n",

Like unto preserved pearls.” [Al-Waqi`ah 56:22-23]</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first group will enter Paradise looking like the moon on the night when it is full, and those who follow them will be like the brightest shining star in the sky. Their hearts will be as one, and there will be no hatred or jealousy among them. Each man will have two wives from among <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Al-Hur Al-`Iyn</a> , the marrow of whose calves can be seen from beneath the bone and flesh.” (Narratedby Al-Bukhari, no. 3014)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: `Going out and coming back for the sake of Allah is better than this world and all that is in it. And a spot the size of the bow of one of you in Paradise – or a spot the size of his whip – is better than this world and all that is in it. If a woman from among the people of Paradise were to look at the people of this earth, she would light up all that is in between them and fill it with fragrance. The veil on her head is better than this world and all that is in it.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2587)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_have_sex_in_Jannah\">Can you have sex in Jannah?</span></h3>\n<p>A man will have intercourse in Paradise with his wives from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn and his wives from among the people of this world, if they enter Paradise with him. A man will be given the strength of a hundred men to eat, drink, feel desire and have sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer in Paradise will be given such and such strength for sexual intercourse.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, will he really be able to do that?” He said, “He will be given the strength of one hundred (men).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2459. He said, it is authentic)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It was narrated from Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man among the people of Paradise will be given the strength of a hundred men for eating, drinking, desire and sexual intercourse. A man among the Jews said, `The one who eats or drinks needs to excrete!’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: `The excretion of any one of them will be in the form of sweat which comes out through his skin, then his stomach will reduce in size again.’” (Narrated by Ahmad, 18509 and Ad-Darimi, 2704)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Quran commentators said concerning the phrase “busy in joyful things” (Ya-Sin 36:55 – interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;`Abdullah ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), and Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Al-A`mash, Sulayman At-Taymi and Al-Awza`i said concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning),</p>\n<p>“Verily, the dwellers of Paradise, that Day, will be busy in joyful things” [Ya-Sin 36:55]</p>\n<p>they said, (it means) they will be busy deflowering virgins. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, according to a report narrated from him, that “busy in joyful things” means listening to stringed instruments. Abu Hatim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he misheard the phrase Iftidad Al-Abkar (deflowering virgins) and thought it was Sama` Al-awtar (listening to stringed instruments). In fact the correct phrase is Iftidaad Al-Abkar (deflowering virgins).

      "question": "<p>Among some young people it is common to hang up flags and symbols of some non-Muslim countries, and we see them buying and keeping these things, printing them on shirts, pants, belts, glasses, hats, shoes, rulers, pens, rings and watches, and putting them on car seat covers and window decals. Some of them buy the complete flag and put it on the hood or trunk of the car. What is the ruling on buying and selling, keeping and hanging up these flags?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>One of the aims of Islamic sharia is that the Muslim should be distinct from all disbelievers and evildoers in terms of beliefs, attitudes, behaviour and thinking, and even in outward appearance and language too, and that he should cut off all ties of love, loyalty and support for anyone who disbelieves in Allah and His Messenger. There is a great deal of shar‘i evidence, both in the form of clear texts (of Qur’an and Sunnah) in the form of rulings derived from those texts, to support this basic Islamic principle, that warns lest one go against it or take it lightly by way of aping and imitating those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day, and do not regard as prohibited that which Allah and His Messenger prohibited. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then We have put you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) on a plain way of (Our) commandment (like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islamic Monotheism)). So follow you that (Islamic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not”</p>\n<p>[al-Jaathiyah 45:18]</p>\n<p>“Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) till you follow their religion. Say: \"Verily, the Guidance of Allah (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him) were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Quran), then you would have against Allah neither any Walee (protector or guardian) nor any helper”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:120]</p>\n<p>“and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) far away from some of that which Allah has sent down to you”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:49]</p>\n<p>“Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) to be affected by Allah’s Reminder (this Qur’an), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture (the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) before (i.e. Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened? And many of them were Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)”</p>\n<p>[al-Hadeed 57:16].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The verses that speak of this matter are many and well-known. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when he saw ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas wearing two garments dyed with safflower: “This is the clothing of the disbelievers, so do not wear it.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. It is proven in as-Saheehayn that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went against the way of the People of the Book with regard to leaving the hair loose, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the mushrikeen: let your beards grow and trim your moustaches.” Narrated in as-Saheehayn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadiths and reports from the righteous early generation concerning this matter are many and well-known.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the above it is known that a person cannot be following true Islamic teaching until his outward actions and inward beliefs are in accordance with the command of Allah and His Messenger. So his loyalty should be to Allah, His Messenger and his brothers in faith, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, your Walee (Protector or Helper) is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, - those who perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, and they bow down (submit themselves with obedience to Allah in prayer)” [al-Maa’idah 5:55]. The believers are obliged to disavow disbelief and its people, whether they are Christians, Jews, Magians, atheists or followers of any other path or religion that is contrary to Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to protect the basic principle mentioned above and to protect the Muslim and his Islam from deviation, the Islamic texts prohibit imitation of the disbelievers in matters that are unique to them, be that words, actions, clothes or general appearance, because that poses a danger to the belief of the Muslim, and lest it lead to him thinking well of the disbelief and misguidance that they follow. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been sent ahead of the Hour with the sword, until Allah alone is worshipped with no partner or associate; my provision has been placed beneath the shade of my spear, and humiliation and ignominy have been ordained for those who go against my commands; whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad and others with a jayyid isnaad. And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who imitates others; do not imitate the Jews or the Christians.” A hasan hadith; narrated by at-Tirmidhi and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the Islamic wisdom behind the prohibition on imitating the disbelievers and the obligation to differ from them in outward matters such as dress and the like:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah sent Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with wisdom, namely his Sunnah which is the way and path that He prescribed for him. Part of this wisdom is that He prescribed for him words and deeds that made his way distinct from the way of those who earn His anger and those who go astray, and He enjoined him to differ from them in outward appearance and practices – even if many people cannot see anything wrong with that – for several reasons, including the following:</p>\n<p>·Dressing and acting like them will generate feelings of commonality between those who resemble one another, which may lead to some degree of similarity in attitude and deeds. This is something obvious, because the one who wears the garments of fighting soldiers, for example, will find himself starting to behave like them to some extent, and his attitude will be influenced by that, unless something prevents it.</p>\n<p>·Being different in dress and behaviour will lead to differences and disconnection, which will result in refraining from that which incurs divine wrath and leads to misguidance, and will lead to joining those who are guided and with whom Allah is pleased. Thus the decree of Allah will be fulfilled, that His friends, who are the successful ones, will be allies of one another and His enemies, who are the losers, will likewise be allies of one another.</p>\n<p>The more a person’s heart is filled with living faith and knowledge of true Islam – I do not mean outward pretence or believing in general terms – the more he will feel distant, both outwardly and inwardly, from the Jews and Christians, and the further he will feel from their behaviour and attitudes that even some Muslims may have adopted.</p>\n<p>·Dressing and behaving like them outwardly leads to mixing with them, to the extent that the distinction is no longer there between those who are guided and with whom Allah is pleased, and those with whom Allah is angry and who have gone astray, and other reasons why we should be different.</p>\n<p>This has to do with behaving and dressing like them in ways that would otherwise be permissible, were it not for resembling them. But if it is the matter of behaving like them with regard to that which is part of their disbelief, then it is a branch of disbelief, and going along with them in that implies agreeing with one type of their sins. So this is something that one must be careful about. [End quote]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on the above, there is no doubt that one aspect of being allied with the disbelievers is imitating them and wearing clothes that bear their symbols, such as the cross and the like, being concerned with their pictures, supporting their sports teams, putting their flags on cars, houses and stores, using their names, calling people to love them and befriend them, being proud of belonging to them and to their prominent figures and leaders, and being impressed by their whims and desires that are contrary to Islam. (The Muslims who do that) do not realise that by doing this, they are demolishing one of the basic principles of Islam in their hearts and in the hearts of the Muslims, and they are exacerbating the weakness of the ummah. Verily to Allah we belong and to Him is our return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What all Muslims must do is adhere to the teachings of Islam and the straight path, and beware of deviating from that to the path of those with whom Allah is angry and those who are astray, namely the Jews, Christians and all other polytheists. The Muslims should encourage one another to be righteous and fear Allah, and to do everything that will bring goodness and glory to Islam and the Muslims; they should refrain from everything that may harm the Muslims or help their enemies against them, and they should refrain from propagating and spreading such things.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

      "question": "<p>The annual zakaah on my wealth is a considerable amount (such as 10,000 Egyptian pounds). Previously I have usually given it to the poor or to build a hospital for the poor, etc, but now I am thinking of keeping the value of this zakaah for three or four years in a separate account that brings a suitable annual return in one of the Islamic banks, with the aim of generating a sum that will be suitable for establishing a non-profit centre for da’wah and education using the most modern methods of research and studying in this field for Muslims who begin to have doubts about their religion when they compare it with other religions. Then my annual zakaah will be given to this centre. This is in addition to donations that we hope will be given by other Muslims.<br />\n<br />\n Is this permissible according to sharee’ah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We would like to thank you for your protective jealousy     concerning your religion and for your concern about the Muslims’ situation,     but what you want to do and are asking about is not in accordance with     sharee’ah, because when zakaah becomes due, after one year has passed, it     must be paid immediately, and it is not permissible to delay it if one is     able to pay it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Zakaah is an act of worship and the Muslim must adhere to the     rulings on the amount on which zakaah is to be paid, when it is to be paid     and the types of wealth on which it must be paid; he does not have the right     to delay paying it once the time comes, unless he has an excuse which allows     that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If zakaah is due in Jumaada al-Oola, can we delay it until     Ramadaan with no excuse?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to delay paying zakaah after one year     has been completed unless there is a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as there     being no poor people around at the time when the year is complete, or not     being able to get it to them, or because the money is not accessible, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for delaying it     because of Ramadaan, that is not permissible unless it is only a short     period away, such as if the end of the year comes in the second half of     Sha’baan; in that case there is nothing wrong with delaying it until     Ramadaan. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’, 9/398&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to do business with zakaah wealth for     one who is obliged to pay zakaah, or for the institution that takes the     zakaah wealth and is entrusted with making sure it reaches the people who     are entitled to it. Rather it is obligatory to give it (in the manner     prescribed), and their investments should be made with wealth other than     zakaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about a     charitable organization that wanted to invest its wealth.&nbsp; They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the money mentioned     in the question comes from zakaah, then it must be given to the people who     are entitled to it according to sharee’ah when it reaches the charitable     organization. But if it is not zakaah, then there is no reason why it should     not be used for trade in the interests of the organization, because that     will increase the benefits that the charity aims to achieve.&nbsp; End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’, 9/403, 404&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They were also asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Can a global Islamic charity invest zakaah money that has     been placed in bank accounts until they are able to distribute it, when     investing it is not going to affect the way it is spent according to     sharee’ah, on condition that the investments be made in such a way that it     may be accessed easily in case of need, and in investments that have been     well studied and are reliable, but we do not say that they are guaranteed so     as to avoid anything haraam or doubtful, and on the basis that the charity     is not a person or persons representing themselves, rather it is a separate     entity, and the people in it are working and doing their best to find out     what is best for Islam and the Muslims?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible     for the charity to invest the zakaah money. What should be done is to spend     it in the ways prescribed in sharee’ah, after ensuring that the people     concerned are entitled to it, because the aim of zakaah is to meet the needs     of the poor and pay off the debts of those who are in debt, whereas     investment may cause these benefits to be lost or may delay them a great     deal for those who are entitled to them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’, 9/454, 455&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to giving zakaah to build a hospital for the poor     or some other charitable projects, we have stated in the answer to question     no. <a href=\"/en/answers/39211\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">39211</a> that zakaah is to be     spent on certain categories as prescribed in sharee’ah. Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the     Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen(the poor) and those     employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have     been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in     debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a     holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from     everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tawbah 9:60]</p>\n<p>    So     it is not permissible to give zakaah to any categories other than these.</p>\n<p>    You     have to pay zakaah on time; it is not permissible to delay it when you are     able to pay it, or to invest that money, whether in profitable business     projects or in da’wah projects.</p>\n<p>    With     regard to the da’wah project of which you are thinking, you should try to     persuade whoever you can of the Muslims to finance it without using zakaah     funds.</p>\n<p>    May     Allaah help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.</p>\n<p>    And     Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

If a young woman grows up in the    worship of Allah, she is included among them. Similarly, two women who love each other for    the sake of Allah alone are also included.

If    a woman remembers Allah when she is alone by herself, she will be included among them like    any man. However, the righteous leader is something specific for men. Similarly,    performing the prayers in congregation in the mosque is something specific for men.

It is well known that teaching the child correct language is one of the aims of education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Iqtida’ As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim (1/207):</p>\n<p>It should be noted that becoming accustomed to the language has a powerful effect on one's thinking, attitude and religious commitment, and also has the effect of seeking to follow the example of the early generations of this Ummah, the Companions and Successors of the Companions (Tabi`un). Seeking to follow their example increases reasoning, religious commitment and good attitude. Moreover, the Arabic language is part of this religion, and learning it is obligatory and essential.

It also stunts natural development of knowledge, because knowledge is acquired by learning and researching, but television replaces seeking with mere receiving. Watching TV also weakens the bonds of love between family members, when they let watching shows keep them from speaking to one another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing the parent’s responsibilities in raising the child in Tuhfat Al-Mawlud (241):</p>\n<p>He should avoid letting him become lazy and inactive, and should teach him the opposite. He should not let him rest for more than he needs to refresh his body and soul for more work, for laziness and inactivity bring bad consequences and will end in regret, but hard work brings good consequences, either in this world or in the Hereafter or in both.

Some cartoons, such as Tom &amp; Jerry, give distorted ideas about the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell, and the Reckoning. Some cartoons include distortions of the stories of the Prophets and Messengers, and some poke fun at Islam and Muslims, whilst others (such as <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/225149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pokemon</a>) include <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the beliefs of eastern and idolatrous religions</a>.

Even if a film does not outwardly go against Islam, it still carries notions of western culture that are alien to our society and religion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dr. Wahbah Az-Zuhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Qadiyat Al-Ahdath (6):</p>\n<p>With regard to children’s programs and some adults’ programs, they propagate the spirit of western culture and promote western traditions, and they attract people to western-style parties and clubs.</p>\n<p>One of the effects of this culture is the adoption of imaginary examples instead of following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his companions, the scholars and the Mujahidun. So children start to imitate Superman, Batman and Spiderman and other imaginary characters who do not exist, and they lose out in following the real example, as they get confused by so many imaginary examples who have no faith. &nbsp;(Wasa’il Al-I`lam wal-Atfal: Wijhat nadhar Islamiyyah by Abul-Hasan Sadiq and the article entitled Athar Ar-Rusum Al-Mutaharrikah `ala Al-Atfal by Nizar Muhammad `Uthman)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Islamic_Stance_on_Cartoons_a_Balanced_Approach\">The Islamic Stance on Cartoons: a Balanced Approach</span></h3>\n<p>After stating the positive and negative aspects, the Islamic attitude should be clear in sha Allah. The more negative points there are, the closer the ruling is to stating that it is prohibited, and the more it is able to avoid the negative aspects, the closer it is to being permissible.

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling concerning married muslim men who cheat on thier wives(physically or non physically) and what is the ruling concerning muslim women who knowingly have an affair with married men just for fun?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a man to form an illicit relationship with a non-mahram woman is not just cheating on his wife, it is also a sin and an act of disobedience towards his Lord. Allah has forbidden such relationships and has barred the ways that may lead to the greater form of immorality which is zina (unlawful sexual relationships), which is what is referred to in the question.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The forbidden acts which people commit when they have such relationships are many and include being alone with that person (khulwah), shaking hands with them, looking at them, etc. These are sins which are forbidden in the texts in and of themselves, and because of the sin of zina to which they may lead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a Muslim woman to form an illicit relationship with a man who is not her mahram – whether he is married or not – is also a major sin and is worse than what is mentioned in the first part of the question, because it results in mixing of lineages and it makes the husband doubt whether his children are really his or not, which leads to a great deal of mischief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There follow the fatwas of some of the scholars concerning something that is less serious than meetings between the sexes, so what about things that are more serious?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for any person to correspond with a woman who is not his mahram, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in that.&nbsp; The person who is sending these letters may think that there is no fitnah involved, but the Shaytaan will keep at him until he tempts the man by means of the woman and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded those who hear the Dajjaal to keep away from him, and he said that a man may come to him as a believer, but the Dajjaal will keep at him until he tempts him and leads him astray.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of temptation and danger in correspondence between young men and young women, so they must keep away from it, even&nbsp; though the questioner may say that there is no love involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/578&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah al-Jibreen said, when he was asked about corresponding with a non-mahram woman:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This action is not permissible, because it will provoke desire between them and will make them want to meet one another. This kind of correspondence often causes fitnah (temptation) and plants the seeds of zina in the heart, which leads to evil actions. So we advise those who are seeking that which is in their own best interests and who wish to protect themselves to avoid writing to or speaking with non-mahrams, etc., so as to protect their religious commitment and their honour, and Allah is the Source of help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/578, 579</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to put the sperm of the husband and the egg from the wife in the womb of the second wife?",
      "question": "<p>“Ahmad” has two wives, the first one cannot have children and the second one can have children, praise be to Allah. In the modern scientific age doctors can, by the grace of Allah, put an egg from the second wife with the husband’s sperm (test-tube baby) and mix them and let them start to grow, then place (the fertilized egg) in the womb of the wife who cannot have children, so that the child can grow until he is born. Is this permissible in the light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah? Some people say that it permissible by analogy with breastfeeding, i.e., just as it is permissible to nourish a child with her milk in her lap, it should also be permissible for her to nourish him with her blood in her womb.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This method of fertilization, which involves placing the egg with the husband’s sperm in the womb of the other wife, is a method that is not acceptable according to sharee’ah, and a large number of scholars are of the view that it is haraam. Statements were issued concerning it by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League. Those who initially said that this method was permissible later retracted their view. There follows some of what was said in those statements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The meeting of the Islamic Fiqh Council held on 8 – 13 Safar 1407 AH (11–16 October 1986).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After examining the subject of artificial fertilization –“test-tube babies” – by studying the research presented and listening to comments of experts and doctors, and after discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The methods of artificial fertilization that are known nowadays are seven:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in his wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>ii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm of a man other than the husband and the wife’s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>iii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, and the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to carry it (surrogate motherhood).</p>\n<p>iv.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of strangers, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>v.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.</p>\n<p>vi.Where sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, and fertilization occurs outside the womb, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.</p>\n<p>vii.Where sperm is taken from the husband and placed in the wife’s vagina or uterus so that fertilization may take place inside her body.</p>\n<p>It was determined that the first five methods are all haraam according to sharee’ah and are forbidden completely in and of themselves, or because of the results to which they will lead, such as mixing of lineages, loss of motherhood and other things that are forbidden according to sharee’ah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the sixth and seventh methods, the committee thinks that there is nothing wrong with resorting to them in cases of need, after emphasizing that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majallat al-Majma’ (3/1/423).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 –Statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>and blessings and peace be upon our Master and Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session held at the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, from Saturday 18 Rabee’ al-Aakhir until Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985), examined the remarks submitted by some of its members concerning what the Council had declared permissible … with regard to artificial fertilization and test-tube babies, which was issued in its seventh session, held between 11-16 Rabee’ al-Aakhir 1404 AH, where it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the couple and, after fertilization in a laboratory vessel, the embryo is implanted in the womb of another wife of the same man, as she volunteers to carry this pregnancy of behalf of her co-wife whose womb has been removed – it seems to the committee that this is permissible in cases of need and subject to the general conditions mentioned previously.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The remarks may be summed up as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other wife in whose womb the embryo from the egg of the first wife is implanted may become pregnant with a second child before the embryo becomes established in her womb, as the result of relations with her husband around the time of the implanting of the embryo, then she may give birth to twins and it may not be known which child resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which resulted from relations with the husband, and it may not be known which wife is the mother of the child who resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which is the mother of the child who resulted from relations with the husband. Similarly, one of the two embryos may die at the ‘alaqah or mudghah stage but not be expelled from the uterus until the other child is born, and it may also not be known whether he is the child that resulted from the (implanted) embryo or from relations with the husband. This means that there is confusion as to who the real mother is and there is mixing of lineages which affects a number of rulings. All of this means that the Council must retract their rulings in the case mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Council has also listened to the opinions presented by doctors and obstetricians who attended the meeting and who pointed to the possibility of the other pregnancy being miscarried as the result of marital relations with the woman who is carrying the embryo, and confusion of lineages as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After a discussion of the matter and an exchange of opinions, the Council decided to retract the view that the third type mentioned is permissible, and in the seventh session, 1404 AH.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Qaraaraat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi (pp. 159-161).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to take the husband’s sperm and the wife’s egg and put the mixture in the womb of another wife of the husband.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, when a woman attends women’s gatherings, she should be modest in her dress and polite in her speech, especially if it is a study circle, or it is in a school for teaching Qur’an and Islamic knowledge and the like.</p>\n<p>But it is not prescribed for women to observe hijab on the grounds that the angels can see them, and that the angels are to be regarded in the same manner as non-mahram men, or for them to do that by way of respect and modesty.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence to support this action or to support introducing any rules into the religion of Allah for which Allah has not given permission. If that were correct, then women should wear hijab at home too, because the angels could see her there too.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>Is it true that the angels will not attend women’s halaqahs if the women uncover their hair (i.e., they do not wear their hijab during the study circle)?</p>\n<p>He replied: I do not know of any basis for that. They may recite Qur’an and remember Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, even if they are bare-headed, so long as there is no non-mahram man present. That does not prevent the angels from entering.\" (<em>Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz</em>&nbsp; 24/85).</p>\n<p>With regard to the Muslim woman sitting in study circles and Qur’an circles wearing modest clothing, being well-mannered in her speech and dignified in her actions, this is something praiseworthy and it is what she should adhere to, because being well mannered and paying attention to modesty in study circles and Qur’an circles is something that is prescribed and is encouraged.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is recommended for the one who recites Qur’an outside of prayer to face towards the qiblah and sit in a humble, calm and dignified manner, with his head lowered, and he should pay attention to proper etiquette in his manner of sitting, as he would when sitting before his teacher. This is the most perfect option, but if he recites standing or lying down on his bed, or in any other posture, that is permissible.\"&nbsp;(<em>Mukhtasar at-Tibyaan&nbsp;</em>p. 17).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Racing pigeons, if it is done without prizes, is disliked, and if it leads to looking into houses and private areas, then it is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (4940), Ibn Majah (3764) and Ahmad (8543) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a man chasing a pigeon and he said: “A devil chasing a she-devil.” Classed as sound by al-Albani and the commentators on <em>al-Musnad</em>.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>`Awn al-Ma`bud</em> (13/194): He only called him a devil because he was drifting away from the truth, and because he was distracted by something that did not concern him. And he called the pigeon a she-devil because it made him heedless of remembering Allah. End quote.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Keeping pigeons for their chicks and eggs, or as pets, or to carry messages, is permissible and is not disliked.</p>\n<p>As for playing with them by making them fly and race, it was said that it is not disliked, but the correct view is that it is disliked, and the person’s testimony is not to be rejected for his merely doing that. But if, in addition to that, he gambles [by betting on the outcome of the race] and the like, then his testimony is to be rejected.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Rawdat at-Talibin</em>, 11/226.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;The authorities should prevent those who play with pigeons above people’s heads, because that leads to them looking out over them and seeing into the private areas of their houses (‘awrah).</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud narrated in his <em>Sunan</em> from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (sa), that he saw a man chasing a pigeon and he said: “A devil chasing a she-devil.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim an-Nakha`i said: Whoever plays with flying pigeons will not die until he tastes the pain of poverty.</p>\n<p>Al-Hasan said: I was present when `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) was delivering a khutbah in which he ordered that pigeons be slaughtered and dogs be killed. It was mentioned by al-Bukhari.</p>\n<p>Khalid al-Hadhdha’ narrated that one of the Tabi`in said: The people of Pharaoh used to play with pigeons, and Shurayh did not accept the testimony of one who owned a bathhouse or pigeons.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Mubarak narrated from Sufyan: We heard playing with pigeons is one of the actions of the people of Lut.</p>\n<p>Al-Bayhaqi narrated that Usamah ibn Zayd said: I was present when `Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) instructed that flying pigeons be slaughtered, but those whose were clipped were to be left alone.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>at-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah</em>, p. 240.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to race pigeons for prizes, whether the prize is money, a cup or anything else, and whether the prize is provided by the competitors themselves or by another party, because this is not one of the races or competitions for which Islam allows awarding prizes.</p>\n<p>It was narrated by Abu Dawud (2574), At-Tirmidhi (1700; he classed it as sound) and Ibn Majah (2878) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “There should be no prizes for contests except in archery, horse races or camel races.”</p>\n<p>Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Abu Dawud, and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>As-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Khattabi said: That is, it is not permissible to accept money as a prize for contests except in these two cases, namely camel racing and horse racing. We may add to that similar contests, such as contests in using tools of war, because awarding prizes for that is encouraging jihad and motivating people to participate in it.\" (<em>Hashiyat As-Sindi ‘Ala Sunan Ibn Majah</em>, 2/206)&nbsp;.</p>\n<p>See also the answers to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147826\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">147826</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud",
      "question": "<p>What is the detailed explanation for moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud, and is there a hadeeth about that?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>May Allah reward you with good and benefit the ummah by your knowledge.</div>\n<p> </p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is Sunnah to point with the forefinger and move it during the Tashahhud, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (18890) and al-Nasaa’i from Waa’il ibn Hajar who said: I said, I will watch how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prays. So I watched him and he stood up and said “Allahu akbar,” and raised his hands until they were level with his ears, then he placed his right hand over his left and left wrist and left forearm. Then when he wanted to bow he raised his hands likewise. He put his hands on his knees, then when he raised his head he raised his hands likewise. Then he prostrated and put his hands level with his ears, then he sat resting on his left foot and placed his left hand on his thigh and left knee, and he put the elbow of his right hand on his right thigh. Then he made a circle with two of his fingers, then he raised his finger and I saw him moving it and making du’aa’ with it.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (580) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: When he – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – sat during the prayer, he would place his right hand on his right thigh and clench all his fingers, and point with the finger that is next to the thumb, and he would place his left hand on his left thigh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat during the prayer, he would put his hands on his thighs and raise the finger of his right hand that is next to the thumb, and make du’aa’ with it, and his left hand would be resting on his left thigh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nasaa’i (1273) narrated that Sa’d said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by me whilst I was making du’aa’ with my fingers and he said, “One, one,” and pointed with his index finger. Meaning: point with one finger, namely the index finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad (5964) narrated that Naafi’ said: When ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar sat during the prayer, he would put his hands on his thighs and point with his finger whilst looking at it. Then he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “It is harder on the Shaytaan than iron,” meaning the index finger. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 159.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth indicate two things:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – That one should point with the finger throughout the entire Tashahhud</p>\n<p>2 – That one should move it when making du’aa’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) explained the phrases narrated for the du’aa’ in the Tashahhud. He said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every time you make du’aa’ then move your finger towards upwards towards the One upon Whom you are calling, so we say:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu (Peace be upon you O Prophet) – you should point your finger whilst reciting this because the salaam is a kind of du’aa’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-salaamu ‘alayna (peace be upon us) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allahumma baarik ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A’oodhu Billaaih min ‘adhaabi Jahannam (I seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wa min ‘adhaab il-qabr (and from the torment of the grave) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wa min fitnat il-mahyaa wa’l-mamaat (and from the trials of life and death) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wa min fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal (and from the trial of the Dajjaal) – point your finger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Every time you make du’aa’ point upwards towards the One upon Whom you are calling.

He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the next day and said: O Messenger of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter.” Then (the man) came the third day and said: O Prophet of Allah, what supplication is best? He said: “Ask your Lord for pardon and for wellbeing in this world and in the Hereafter, for if you are pardoned and granted wellbeing in this world and the Hereafter, you will have succeeded.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3846 and others; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that it was said to him: Your brothers have come to you from Basra – and at that time he was in Az-Zawiyah – so that you may pray to Allah for them. He said: May Allah forgive us, have mercy on us, and give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good, and protect us from the Fire. They asked him to say more, so he said something similar, then he said: If you are granted this, then you have been granted all that is good in this world and the hereafter. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in&nbsp;Al-Adab Al-Mufrad, 633; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>On the contrary, this Hadith definitively indicates that it is prescribed to offer supplication asking Allah for worldly matters.</p>\n<p>`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught her the following supplication: “Allahumma inni as’aluka min Al-khayri kullihi, `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam. Wa a`udhu bika min ash-sharri kullihi, `ajilihi wa ajilihi, ma `alimtu minhu wa ma lam a`lam.

And I seek refuge with You from all evil, now and in the future, what I know and what I do not know.&nbsp; O Allah, I ask You for the good that Your slave and Prophet asked You for, and I seek refuge with You from the evil from which Your slave and Prophet sought refuge. O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and for that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from Hell and from that which brings one closer to it, in word and deed. And I ask You to make every decree that You decree concerning me good).”</p>\n<p>Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came in one day and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was there, and there was no one except me, my mother, and Umm Haram, my maternal aunt. He came into our house and said to us: Shall I not lead you in prayer? And that was not at the time for any of the [five daily] prayers. A man who was present [when this Hadith was narrated] said: Where did he make Anas stand? He said: He made him stand on his right, then he led us in prayer, then he offered supplication for us – the members of the household – asking for everything good in this world and the hereafter. My mother said: O Messenger of Allah, your little servant [meaning Anas]; pray to Allah for him. So he prayed for everything good for me, and at the end of his supplication he said: O Allah, grant him much wealth and many children, and bless him. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari in&nbsp;Al-Adab Al-Mufrad,&nbsp;88; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_is_blameworthy_in_seeking_worldly_matters\"><strong>What is blameworthy in seeking worldly matters?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>What is blameworthy in that regard is two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first thing is when this world is all that a person cares about and strives for, as stated above, and he has no interest in the hereafter and does not strive for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is when his supplication – which is one of the best ways of drawing close to Allah, and is an act of worship and one of the greatest means of attaining what one seeks – is all for worldly matters.</p>\n<p>Ubayy ibn Ka`b (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Give glad tidings to this Ummah of prominence, victory and prevalence, so whoever among them does a deed pertaining to the hereafter <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/228454\" target=\"_blank\">for worldly gain</a> , he will have no share in the hereafter.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 21223 and others; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him. Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will settle his affairs for him and make him feel content with his lot, and his provision and worldly gains will undoubtedly come to him.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 4105; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Hence one of the supplications of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asking Allah that this world should not be his main concern and goal.</p>\n<p>Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rarely got up to leave a gathering before offering this supplication for his companions: “O Allah, grant us a share of fear of You that will prevent us from disobeying You, and a share of obedience and righteous deeds that will enable us to reach Your Paradise, and a share of certain faith that will enable us to bear the calamities of this world. Grant us the benefit of our hearing, sight and good health throughout our lives, and let us enjoy them until the last moment of our lives. Enable us to settle the scores with those who have wronged us, and grant us victory over those who oppose us. Do not let calamity befall us in our faith, do not let this world be our main concern or make it all that we know, and do not send against us those who will not show mercy to us.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3502; classed as sound by Al-Albani)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second blameworthy thing is when a person is seized by love of this world to the extent that he does not care whether he seeks worldly gain through permissible means or prohibited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril inspired to me that no soul will die until it has completed its allotted timespan and received its provision in full. So be moderate in seeking provision, and no one of you should let thinking that provision is slow in coming prompt him to seek it by sinful means, for what is with Allah cannot be attained except through obedience to Him” (Narrated by Abu Nu`aym in&nbsp;Al-Hilyah, 10/26 and others; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>Based on these two points, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/4448\" target=\"_blank\">being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter</a> , and seeking worldly gain by whatever means are available, not caring whether they are forbidden or prohibited – this is how we should understand the warning against striving for worldly matters or praying for worldly matters.</p>\n<p>Abu Mu`awiyah Al-Aswad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The one for whom this world is his main concern will suffer lengthy worry and distress in the hereafter.”</p>\n<p>Maslamah ibn `Abd Al-Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Those who will feel the least distress in the hereafter are those who have the least worries and stress in this world.”</p>\n<p>Both reports were narrated by Ibn Abu Ad-Dunya in&nbsp;Dhamm Ad-Dunya&nbsp;(283, 284).</p>\n<p>In conclusion,&nbsp; the wording mentioned in the question was not soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there is no sound report from him to suggest that it is not allowed to offer supplication for what is good in this world, so it is not correct to say that praying for what is good in this world will bring worries and stress.</p>\n<p>Rather what has been narrated is a warning against being distracted by worldly concerns from the hereafter, or seeking worldly gains in ways that are not permissible.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, will say to His angels – although He knows best – ‘Look at the salah of My slave, whether it is complete or incomplete.’ If it is perfect, it will be recorded as perfect, and if something is lacking, He will say, ‘Look and see whether My slave did any voluntary (nafl) prayers.’ If he did some voluntary prayers, [Allah] will say, Complete the obligatory actions of My slave from his voluntary actions.’ Then all his actions will be dealt with in a similar manner.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The blessings that Allah bestows upon people are many, and His bounty and generosity towards them are vast. A blessing can only be responded to by giving thanks and appreciating it. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has enjoined giving thanks to Him, for He is Appreciative and loves those who give thanks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah has provided for you. And be grateful for the Graces of Allah, if it is He Whom you worship”&nbsp;[al-Nahl 16:144]</p>\n<p>“seek your provision from Allah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back”&nbsp;[al-‘Ankaboot 29:17]</p>\n<p>Part of being grateful to Allah is seeking to draw closer to Him by means of different kinds of acts of worship and to endear oneself to Him by means of good deeds such as prayer, zakaah, fasting and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another part of being grateful to Allah is giving thanks to Him by means of sacrifice rituals, which means offering a sacrifice for the sake of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the verse “Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only)” [al-Kawthar 108:2]:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant is that prayer and sacrifice are the best of the things by means of which one may draw closer to Allah, and the usage of the word fa (translated here as “therefore”) points to the reason, i.e., doing that – prayer and sacrifice – in gratitude for that which Allah has given him of al-Kawthar (a river in Paradise) and much goodness. So he should give thanks to the One Who has blessed him and worship Him, and the two greatest types of worship are these two acts of worship; indeed, prayer is the ultimate act of worship. It is as if He is saying to him: We have given you al-Kawthar and a great deal of goodness, and We have blessed you with that because you have been doing these two acts of worship in gratitude for Our blessing to you; these are the reasons why We have bestowed these blessings upon you, so do these two things for Us, for prayer and sacrifice are surrounded by blessings that come before them and after them. The best financial act of worship is sacrifice and the best physical act of worship is prayer, and the benefits that a slave of Allah may gain from prayer cannot be compared to any other type of worship, as is&nbsp; known by those whose hearts are alive and those of high aspirations. Adding to it the benefits of offering sacrifice, which is a sign of devotion to Allah and thinking positively of Him, and having strong&nbsp; certainty and faith about that which is in the hand of Allah is something wonderful, if that is accompanied by faith and sincerity. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) obeyed the command of his Lord and prayed and sacrificed a great deal to Him; he even sacrificed sixty-three camels with his own hand during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and he used to offer sacrifices on the Eids and at other times. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo’ al-Fatawa 916/532).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If Allah bestows a great blessing upon a person – and all His blessing are great – then it is mustahabb for him to give thanks to Allah for it by showing kindness to people, so he should offer a sacrifice and make food and invite his brothers and friends, and give charity to those who are in need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (26/180-181):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is mustahabb to give thanks anew when new blessings come, by speaking words of praise. Gratitude for that may also be expressed by doing acts of worship, which includes offering a sacrifice or inviting people to a meal. The fuqaha’ have mentioned the kinds of meals that may be offered when blessing are renewed, such as the wakeerah which is made for a new home, or naqee’ah which is made on the return of an absent loved one, and hidhaaq which is done when a child completes a reading of the Qur’aan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The view of the Hanbalis, the more correct view among the Shaafa’is, is that these meals are mustahabb.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said: These invitations – other than the wedding feast (waleemah) and ‘aqeeqah – are something good, but they are like invitations that are given for no reason; if the person who does them intends thereby to give thanks to Allah for His blessing and to feed his brothers and offer food, then he will have the reward for that in sha Allah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If one of my children does well in school, is it permissible for me to offer a sacrifice to celebrate his success, and to give thanks to Allah?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with making food (waleemah) if the children or one of them succeeds, and inviting one’s loved ones and his child’s friends, to celebrate Allah’s blessing and to encourage the child. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 161, question no. 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is essential to beware of some beliefs which many people hold, and say that in order to protect the new house or car it is essential to offer a sacrifice and sprinkle it with the blood of the slaughtered animal, or that evil spirits will not keep away from you unless you do that, otherwise the blessing will soon dissipate.&nbsp; hese are jaahili beliefs which do not come from someone who believes in Allah as his Lord Who possesses all powers to bring benefit or cause harm, in Whose hand is the creation and the commandment, and knows that it is not permissible to do acts of worship unless they are done for the sake of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about the belief held by many people, that offering a sacrifice on the threshold of the new house before entering it is one of the most important means of warding off the evil eye, and making the house blessed, and avoiding calamities and undesirable events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this custom – i.e., offering a sacrifice on the threshold of the new house – is done in order to placate the jinn and ward off calamities and undesirable events, then it is a haraam custom, and is in fact shirk. This is what seems to be the case with offering the sacrifice before entering the house, and doing it on the threshold in particular.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the intention is to honour one's new neighbours and get to know them, and to give thanks to Allah for the blessing of a new home, and to honour one's relatives and friends on this occasion, and to show them the house, then this is good and the one who does it is to be praised for his action. But that is only usually done after the people have moved into the house, and not before, and the animal or animals should not be slaughtered on the threshold of the house or in the entryway to the house.

      "question": "<p>I am a twenty-seven-year-old woman. I am completely bald on my head as a result of sickness, may Allah grant us and you wellbeing. This causes me a great deal of embarrassment when I have to meet people, and in front of my colleagues at work. That has had a great impact on my psychology. It was suggested to me that I could replace my hair with a wig that is attached to the head and remains there, and can be taken off the head once a month. Is it permissible for me to wear this type of wig, and to do ghusl and wudu and pray whilst wearing it? This is the most appropriate for me, as the nature of my work and my life requires me to be with people all the time, and I find it very difficult and embarrassing to conceal this defect.

I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) forbid things such as this, and he said: “The Children of Israel were doomed when their women adopted such things.”</p>\n<p>Many of the scholars regarded wearing a wig as coming under the same heading as adding hair extensions, and Allah has cursed the woman who adds hair extensions and the woman who asks to have them added, as al-Bukhari (59937) and Muslim (2122) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed the one who adds hair extensions and the one who has them added, and the one who does tattoos and the one who has them done.” (See <i>Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah, </i>5/191)</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that there is a concession allowing a woman to wear a wig if all of her hair has fallen out.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who took medicine which led to the hair on her head, or most of it, falling out, and she does not want to use a wig because she thinks it is haram. He replied:</p>\n<p>“With regard to using a wig in a case such as the one you described, where her hair has fallen out in such a way that there is no hope that it will grow back, we say: in a case such as this, there is nothing wrong with wearing a wig, because in fact it is not for the purpose of enhancing beautification; rather it is in order to remove a defect. Based on that, it does not come under the heading of adding hair extensions, for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) cursed the one who does that, as he cursed the woman who adds hair extensions and the woman who asks for them to be added. The one who adds hair extensions is the one who attaches something to her hair. But in fact, this woman does not come under the heading of hair extensions, because she does not want to enhance her beauty herself or add to her natural hair that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, created; rather she wants to remove a defect that has occurred, and there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of removing a defect and not under the heading of enhancing beautification. There is a difference between the two matters.” (From the <a href=\"https://binbaz.org.sa/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaykh’s website</a>)</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If someone were to say: What do you say about a bald woman who has no hair on her head – is it permissible for her to wear a wig to cover the defect, not for the purpose of enhancing beautification or making the hair longer?</p>\n<p>The answer – and Allah knows best – is that it is permissible, but there is the story of the woman and her daughter who caught the measles and her hair became thin. She asked the Prophet whether she could add hair extensions and he did not allow her to do that.</p>\n<p>The response to that is: what appears to be the case is that the hair was not lost completely, hence she asked to be allowed to add hair extensions, and asking to add hair extensions indicates that&nbsp; some of the hair was still present, and if some of the hair is present, then adding to it is done for the purpose of enhancing beautification. But if there is no hair, then it is a defect – what I mean is that her head looks like her cheek, with no hair on it at all. And this is something that happens. Do not think that this is a hypothetical matter, for it is not a hypothetical; rather it is real. In that case it seems to me that there is nothing wrong with this, because the purpose is different from the purpose of adding hair extensions, which are not allowed, or it was narrated that the doer is cursed, and that is what is referred to in the hadith.” (Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari,<i> </i>7/599, 600)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ruling_on_hair_implants_for_one_whose_hair_has_fallen_out\">Ruling on hair implants for one whose hair has fallen out</span></h3>\n<p>It is permissible for the one whose hair has fallen out to seek a remedy, even by having a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/113548\" target=\"_blank\">hair transplant</a> , and this does not come under the heading of changing the creation of Allah; rather it is a treatment to restore what Allah, may He be exalted, had created.</p>\n<p>It says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation that was held during its eighteenth session in Malaysia 24-29 Jumada al-Akhirah 1428 AH/9-14 July 2007 CE, regarding cosmetic procedures and what is permissible thereof:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Correcting acquired defects that result from burns, accidents, disease and so on, such as skin transplants and patching, reshaping of the breast completely in the event that it has been entirely removed, or partially reshaping it if its size is too large or too small, such as if it may lead to health problems, and hair transplants in the event of hair loss, especially in women.”</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_should_one_who_wears_a_wig_do_wudu_and_ghusl\">How should one who wears a wig do wudu and ghusl?</span></h3>\n<p>If you wear a wig, you may wipe over it when <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/141074\" target=\"_blank\">doing wudu</a> , because the concession allowing wiping over it is based on making things easier, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stuck his hair together in a process called talbeed when doing Hajj, and wiped over it, meaning that he put something like glue over it, to hold the hair together and not let dust get into it.</p>\n<p>However it must be taken off when doing ghusl, because it is obligatory to make the water reach all of the skin.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_women_appear_in_front_of_men_wearing_the_wignbsp\">Can women appear in front of men wearing the wig?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>It is not permissible to appear in front of men wearing the wig, because it is a kind of adornment that must be covered, in addition to what it may involve of attracting men’s attention.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to grant you healing and well-being.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I like to fast in the winter because the days are short. Of course I hope for the reward of Allah, but I also hope to lose a little weight. Is it permissible for me to combine two intentions? Another question also occurred to me: many people – including myself – are afraid of sin and of committing haraam actions for fear of what people will say, or for fear of scandal or shame, or loss of dignity and self-pride. Will that be good for a person in the hereafter?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with combining the intention of seeking reward for fasting and the intention of losing weight, although it is preferable for a person to intend his fasting for the purpose of attaining reward only. Losing weight will inevitably happen when one fasts, whether one intends that or not.</p>\n<p>As-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ashbaah wa’n-Nazaa’ir (pp. 21-22):</p>\n<p>Combined intentions (and motives) are of many types. Firstly, a person may have, alongside the intention of worship, a motive that is not worship but will not invalidate it. One example of that is if a person intends to do wudoo’ or ghusl, and also to cool himself. There are some views which suggest that it is not valid because of that combined intention, but the more correct view is that it is valid, because cooling oneself is something that will inevitably happen, regardless of whether or not that was part of the motive for doing wudoo’ or ghusl. So he did not plan to have a combined intention, and he did not intend to undermine his sincerity; rather his intention was to do an act of worship in a manner or at a time that is prescribed, because one of its inevitable outcomes is cooling oneself. The same applies if a person has the intention to fast, and also has another motive, namely the desire to avoid certain foods for reasons of health. But there is still some difference of opinion concerning that.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/112075&nbsp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">112075&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>With regard to giving up sin for fear of what people will say, or because the individual has no motive to commit that sin, or he refrains from it because of shyness before people, this has been discussed previously in detail, in the answer to question number <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/180814\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">180814</a>&nbsp; qv.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>The nature of the place in which we pray is such that when it gets full, we close the door, and some people pray outside the prayer-place, following the imaam by hearing his voice on the loudspeakers. Is their prayer valid even though they are outside the mosque?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It           was narrated that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him)           said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace           and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was staying in a hut made of palm           leaves. He prayed in that hut and some men followed him, they came and           prayed with him. And in the hadeeth in which this incident is described,           it says: “The best prayer of a man is prayers offered in his house,           except for the obligatory prayers.” (Agreed upon) </p>\n<p>&nbsp;This           hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to follow the imaam even if           he is in a room where the person following him cannot see him, or if           one of them is on the roof and the other is in a lower place. The point           is that if it is possible to follow the imaam if they are all inside           the mosque, there is no dispute among the scholars that it is permissible           for him to do so. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;The           hadeeth also indicates that the presence of a barrier between the imaam           and the members of the congregation does not mean that the prayer and           their following the imaam are invalid. Al-Nawawi said: “For their following           to be valid, the person following has to know when the imaam moves,           whether they are praying in the mosque or elsewhere, or one of them           is in the mosque and the other is outside – this is according to scholarly           consensus.” </p>\n<p>&nbsp;If           one of them is outside the mosque and he can see the imaam or other           members of the congregation, even if the rows are interrupted, the prayer           is valid because there is nothing to make it invalid and there is something           to make it valid – which is that he can see either the imaam or some           of the people behind him, and he is able to follow the prayer. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;In           al-Insaaf it says: with           regard to the continuity of the rows, reference should be made to al-‘urf           (local custom, i.e., what is traditionally regarded as being complete),           according to the correct view. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;It           says in al-Mughni: interruptions           (in the rows) do not matter. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa'i,           because there is no limit in that, since it does not prevent following           the imaam. What matters here is what would prevent a person from seeing           or hearing the imaam. Al-Nawawi made it a condition that there should           not be big gaps outside the mosque, which is the view of the majority           of scholars. And Allaah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on inviting people to fast together on a particular day and offer supplication (du`a) on that day",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on inviting people to fast together on a particular day, and all recite a specific supplication (specifying what is to be said in that supplication), and at a specific time (such as saying: “We invite everyone at such and such an hour Makkah time) to support our Muslim brothers in Palestine, or some other Muslim country; please share and circulate this invitation, by text or Internet”)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslims faced crises at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions and those who came after them, and they did not call on one another to fast on a specific day and offer specific supplications at a specific time. Thus it is known that doing this is an innovation (bid‘ah); if it was something good, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions would have done it.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on fasting together and agreeing to meet for iftar, whether that is during Ramadan or on Mondays and Thursdays?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>No, the most serious issue is agreeing to fast on a particular day. We think that this is something that the Sahabah never did; they never agreed or promised one another that they would fast on Mondays and Thursdays, and so on, and there is the fear that the matter may develop into something more serious than that, in which case we would be imitating the Sufis who agree to recite a specific dhikr, which they get together and recite in unison. Hence if someone says to his friends: ‘Whoever fasts tomorrow, iftar will be at So-and-so’s house,’ there is nothing wrong with that, but agreeing and promising one another to fast on a specific day, this is not the practice of the Sahabah. Moreover, the fact that a person gets accustomed to not fasting unless someone else fasts with him is problematic. The individual should fast on his own initiative, regardless of whether someone else is fasting with him or not. This is the way of the righteous early generations.\"(<em>Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh</em>&nbsp; 174/24).</p>\n<p>He was also asked about some people who get together in the blessed month of Ramadan to recite some adhkar and du`as that are narrated in the Sunnah; they do that before the time of iftar and they recite together in unison. Is it permissible for us to do that?</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:</p>\n<p>When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave a khutbah, his eyes turned red, he raised his voice and sounded angry, and he said: “To proceed: the best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad; the worst of matters are those that are newly introduced into the religion. Every innovation is a going astray, and every going astray leads to the Fire.” When he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) broke his fast, he did not call people together so that they could remember Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, or call upon Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in a loud voice and reciting in unison with others. Rather each person broke his fast with his family, and each person offered supplication by himself, speaking quietly, between him and his Lord. As this habit that is referred to by the questioner was not known at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then we know that it comes under the heading of innovations which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned us against, and explained that every innovation is a going astray, and every going astray leads to the Fire.\"(<em>Fatawa Nur ‘ala al-Darb</em>&nbsp; 212/6-7).</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Suhaym was asked:</p>\n<p>In the past, we always received messages via email asking us to fast on a specific day and to pray qiyam on that day in support of our brothers in Palestine, by way of encouraging us to offer supplication and to exhort one another to hold fast to the truth.</p>\n<p>Is it an innovation (bid‘ah), for a group of us to agree that each of us will pray qiyam at home on a specific night, in which we will offer supplication, reciting du`as from the Quran and Sunnah?</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>As for doing righteous deeds for the sake of supporting our brothers in Palestine, I think that this idea is an innovation that originally came from the Christian countries.</p>\n<p>Seventy of the reciters of Quran among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were killed, yet despite that there is nothing to suggest that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted or prayed (salah) for their sake. Rather he offered supplication (du`a), calling upon Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, as is narrated in <em>al-Sahihayn</em>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when he sent the army on the day of Mu’tah, then became aware that some of his companions had been killed, there is no report to suggest that he did any such actions.</p>\n<p>Rather his practice was to offer supplication (du`a) and strive hard in doing so.</p>\n<p>He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) strove hard in offering supplication on the day of Badr.</p>\n<p>He also offered supplication from the minbar on Fridays, and this is something that khatibs need to be reminded of.</p>\n<p>As for agreeing to pray qiyam on a specific night, this is something for which there is no basis in Islamic teachings, unless someone gets up to pray qiyam and others follow his lead and get up to pray qiyam too, without any prior promise or agreement.</p>\n<p>The Prophet’s cousin Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) stood behind him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and joined him in prayer [at night], as did Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) on one occasion.</p>\n<p>And on one occasion, Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) stood behind him and joined him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in praying qiyam.</p>\n<p>But all of that happened without any prior agreement or promise.</p>\n<p>Similar to that is if a man gets up to pray qiyam, and one of his children gets up and prays with him, or if a righteous man stays overnight in someone’s house and gets up to pray qiyam; in that case it is permissible to join him in prayer.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade singling out the night before Friday for praying qiyam, without praying qiyam on other nights, lest anyone think that that night has any particular virtue that other nights do not have.</p>\n<p>I do not think there is any need to make an agreement to pray qiyam on a specific night; rather each of you can encourage and exhort others to pray qiyam and strive hard in offering supplication for the weak and oppressed throughout the world, east and west.\"(Mishkat website).</p>\n<p>What appears to us to be the case is that this invitation is not Islamically acceptable, and it is not appropriate to take part in it or invite others to do so.</p>\n<p>What is required of the Muslim is to offer supplication and pray to Allah for his Muslim brothers everywhere, without allocating a specific time for that or fasting for that purpose.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to save the weak and oppressed believers, and to destroy the oppressors and aggressors.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

This festival became connected with the saint known as Valentine who was sentenced to death on 14 February 270 CE. The kuffar still celebrate this festival, during which immorality and evil are practiced widely.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_Muslims_celebrate_Valentinersquos_Daynbsp\">Can Muslims celebrate Valentine’s Day?&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to celebrate any of the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/106668\" target=\"_blank\">festivals of the kuffar</a> , because festivals come under the heading of shar’i issues which are to be based on the sound texts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Festivals are part of shari’ah, clear way and rituals of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.” [al-Maidah 5:48]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies which they must follow.” [al-Hajj 22:67]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-- such as the qiblah (direction faced in prayer), prayer and fasting. There is no difference between their participating in the festival and their participating in all other rituals. Joining in fully with the festival is joining in with kufr, and joining in with some of its minor issues is joining in with some of the branches of kufr. Indeed, festivals are one of the most unique features that distinguish various religions and among their most prominent symbols, so joining in with them is joining in with the most characteristic and prominent symbols of kufr. No doubt joining in with this may lead to complete kufr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Partially joining in, at the very least, is disobedience and sin. This was indicated by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “Every people has its festival and this is our festival.” This is worse than joining them in wearing the zinar (a garment that was worn only by ahl al-dhimmah) and other characteristics of theirs, for those characteristics are man-made and are not part of their religion, rather the purpose behind them is simply to distinguish between a Muslim and a kafir. As for the festival and its rituals, this is part of the religion which is cursed along with its followers, so joining in with it is joining in with something that is a cause of incurring the wrath and punishment of Allah.” (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim (1/207)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said (may Allah have mercy on him):</p>\n<p>“It is not permissible for the Muslims to imitate them in anything that is uniquely a part of their festivals, whether it be food, clothing, bathing, lighting fires, refraining from a regular habit, doing acts of worship or anything else. It is not permissible to give a feast or to give gifts, or to sell anything that will help them to do that for that purpose, or to allow children and others to play games that are part of the festivals, or to wear one’s adornments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To conclude: the Mulsims should not do any of their rituals at the time of their festivals; rather the day of their festival should be like any other day for the Muslims. The Muslims should not do anything specific in imitation of them.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa (25/329)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If the Christians have a festival, and the Jews have a festival, it is only for them, so no Muslim should join them in that, just as no Muslim should join them in their religion or their direction of prayer.” (Tashabbuh al-Khasis bi Ahl al-Khamis, published in Majallat al-Hikmah (4/193)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadith to which Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah referred was narrated by al-Bukhari (952) and Muslim (892) from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: Abu Bakr came in and there were two young girls of the Ansar with me who were singing about what had happened to the Ansar on the day of Bu’ath. She said: And they were not (professional) singing girls. Abu Bakr said: “Musical instruments of the shaytan in the house of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?!” and that was on the day of ‘Eid. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Abu Bakr, every people has a festival and this is our festival.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (1134) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, they had two days when they would play. He said: “What are these two days?” They said: “We used to play on these days during the Jahiliyyah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has given you instead of them two days that are better than them: the day of al-Adha and the day of al-Fitr.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates that festivals are among the characteristics by which nations are distinguished, and it is not permissible to celebrate the festivals of the ignorant and the mushrikin (polytheists).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fatwas_on_celebrating_Valentinersquos_Day\">Fatwas on celebrating Valentine’s Day</span></h3>\n<p>The scholars have issued fatwas stating that it is haram to celebrate Valentine’s Day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 –Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“In recent times the celebration of Valentine’s Day has become widespread, especially among female students. It is a Christian festival where people dress completely in red, including clothes and shoes, and they exchange red flowers. We hope that you can explain the ruling on celebrating this festival, and what your advice is to Muslims with regard to such matters; may Allah bless you and take care of you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Celebrating Valentine’s Day is not permissible for a number of reasons. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10070\" target=\"_blank\">innovated festival</a> for which there is no basis in Islam.</p>\n<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It promotes love and infatuation.</p>\n<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It calls for hearts to be preoccupied with foolish matters that are contrary to the way of the righteous salaf (may Allah be pleased with them).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible on this day to do any of the things that are characteristic of this festival, whether that has to do with food, drinks, clothing, exchanging gifts or anything else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim should be proud of his religion and should not be a weak character who follows every Tom, Dick and Harry. I ask Allah to protect the Muslims from all temptations, visible and invisible, and to protect us and guide us.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (16/199)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – The Standing Committee was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Some people celebrate Valentine’s Day on the fourteenth of February every year. They exchange gifts of red roses and wear red clothes and congratulate one another. Some bakeries make red coloured sweets and draw hearts on them, and some stores advertise products that are especially for this day. What is your opinion on the following?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celebrating this day</p>\n<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buying things from the stores on this day</p>\n<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Storekeepers who are not celebrating it selling things that may be given as gifts to people who are celebrating it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The clear evidence of the Quran and Sunnah – and the consensus of the early generations of this ummah – indicates that there are only two festivals in Islam: ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any other festivals that have to do with a person, a group, an event or anything else are innovated festivals, which it is not permissible for Muslims to observe, approve of or express joy on those occasions, or to help others to celebrate them in any way, because that is transgressing the sacred limits of Allah, and whoever transgresses the sacred limits of Allah has wronged himself.</p>\n<p>If the fabricated festival is also a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12777\" target=\"_blank\">festival of the kuffar</a> , then the sin is even greater, because this is imitating them and it is a kind of taking them as close friends, and Allah has forbidden the believers to imitate them and take them as close friends in His Noble Book. And it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Valentine’s Day comes under this heading because it is an idolatrous <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1130\" target=\"_blank\">Christian festival</a> , so it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe it or approve of it or congratulate people on it. Rather he has to ignore it and avoid it, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and so as to keep away from the causes that incur the wrath and punishment of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also haram for the Muslim to help people to celebrate this or any other haram festival by supplying any kind of food or drink, or buying or selling or manufacturing or giving or advertising etc., because all of that is cooperating in sin and transgression and is disobedience towards Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [al-Maidah 5:2]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim must adhere to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah in all his affairs, especially at times of fitnah when evil is widespread. He should be smart and avoid falling into the misguidance of those who have earned Allah’s anger and who have gone astray, and the evildoers who have no fear of Allah and who do not have any pride in being Muslims. The Muslim must turn to Allah and seek His guidance and remain steadfast in following it, for there is no Guide except Allah and no one can make a person steadfast but Him. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Shaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah preserve him) was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Among our young men and women it has become common to celebrate Valentine’s Day, which is named after a saint who is venerated by the Christians, who celebrate it every year on February 14, when they exchange gifts and red roses, and they wear red clothes. What is the ruling on celebrating this day and exchanging gifts?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firstly: it is not permissible to celebrate these innovated festivals, because it is an innovation for which there is no basis in Islam. It comes under the heading of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: it involves imitating the kuffar and copying them by venerating that which they venerate and respecting their festivals and rituals, and imitating them in something that is part of their religion. In the hadith it says: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly: it results in evils and haram things such as wasting time, singing, music, extravagance, unveiling, wanton display, men mixing with women, women appearing before men other than their mahrams, and other haram things, or things that are a means that lead to immorality. That cannot be excused by the claim that this is a kind of entertainment and fun. The one who is sincere towards himself should keep away from sin and the means that lead to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, it is not permissible to sell these gifts and roses, if it is known that the purchaser celebrates these festivals or will give these things as gifts on those days, so that the seller will not be a partner of the one who does those innovations. And Allah knows best.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

It is mentioned in some of them that this phrase is to be said in the first adhaan without stating what is meant by the phrase “the first adhaan” – is it the adhaan that is given before Fajr or is it the adhaan of Fajr itself?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I used to give the adhaan for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the first adhaan of Fajr I used to say: “Hayya ‘ala al-falaah, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, Allaahu akbar Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (come to prosperity, prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is no god but Allaah).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood, 500; al-Nasaa’i, 647; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: In the first adhaan after the word al-falaah it said: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Shaykh al-Albaani said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated by al-Tahhaawi (1/82) with a hasan isnaad as al-Haafiz said in al-Talkhees (3/169).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 131&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth provide evidence for those who said that this should be said in the first adhaan which comes at the end of the night. But the correct view is that it should be in said the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer has begun. That is for a number of reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(a)</p>\n<p>The word awwal (first) is in relation to the iqaamah, and the iqaamah is the second call to prayer. In the saheeh Sunnah there are reports in which the iqaamah is called an “adhaan”, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Between each two calls (adhaanayn)...” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 598; Muslim, 838.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Saheeh Muslim (739) the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer begins is called the first adhaan. This appears in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) about the prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said: He used to sleep during the first part of the night and wake up during the latter part, then if he had any need for intimacy with his wife he would satisfy that need, then he would sleep. Then when it was the time of the first call, he would wake up and pour water over himself, and if he was not junub he would do wudoo’ as a man does for prayer, then he would pray two rak’ahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by two rak'ahs here is the regular Sunnah of Fajr, as stated by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b)</p>\n<p>In some saheeh ahaadeeth it is clearly stated that the adhaan in which this phrase appears is called adhaan salaat al-subh, adhaan al-fajr, etc. These phrases indicate that this adhaan should come after the time for the prayer begins and the adhaan that is given at the end of the night comes before the time for prayer begins. These ahaadeeth include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, teach me the Sunnah of adhaan.” He wiped the front of my head and said: “Say Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great)… And if it is Fajr prayer, then say: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to another, similar report, it says: “Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep) in the first adhaan of dawn.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood, 501; al-Nasaa’i, 633; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to another report narrated by Abu Dawood (504) from Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him): He used to say in Fajr: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep). Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: It is Sunnah for the muezzin, after saying Hayya ‘ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), to say: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep)” twice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was narrated by al-Daaraqutni (90), Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh and al-Bayhaqi in his Sunan (1/423), and he said: its isnaad is saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by al-Daraaqutni and al-Tahhaawi (1/82) via Hushaym from Ibn ‘Awn with the wording: In the adhaan for Fajr prayer, when the muezzin said: Hayya ‘ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), he said: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep),” twice. This version was narrated by Ibn al-Sakan who classed it as saheeh, as it says in al-Talkhees, 3/148&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 132&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ahaadeeth show that this phrase appears in the adhaan for Fajr prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The adhaan which is the call to prayer is that which comes after the time for the prayer has begun, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the time for prayer begins, then let one of you give the adhaan for you.” Agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the adhaan which comes at the end of the night, this is not an adhaan for Fajr prayer as such, rather it is done “so that the one who is praying qiyaam may go back and the one who is asleep may wake up”, as is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in al-Saheehayn. Thus it is clear that the phrase which appears in the adhaan which comes after the time for the prayer begins is not a bid’ah (innovation), rather it is Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is the reason why the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to say al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, is not done in the first adhaan for Fajr, as is mentioned in Sunan al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Khuzaymah and al-Bayhaqi?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yes, the this phrase should be mentioned in the first adhaan of Fajr, in accordance with the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is clear from the hadeeth that it is the adhaan that is done when the true dawn comes, and it is called ‘first’ in relation to the iqaamah, which is an adhaan according to sharee’ah, as it says in the hadeeth, “Between every two calls (adhaanayn) there should be a prayer.” The word adhaan here does not refer to the call that is given before the appearance of the true dawn. That call is prescribed in order to wake those who are asleep and so that those who are praying qiyaam may go back. It is not a call to announce the Fajr prayer. Whoever studies the ahaadeeth about this phrase will see clearly that they refer to the adhaan given to announce the time of Fajr, not the adhaan which is given at night just before dawn. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 6/63&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on the refutation of those who say that this phrase should be said in the adhaan which comes before the time for the prayer begins, please see al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/61-64&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the view of your teacher, that this phrase is comparing sleep with Fajr prayer, this is not correct, because this phrase is stating that prayer is better than sleep and thus encouraging the sleeper to stop sleeping and get up to do something that is better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Will watching haraam soap operas and plucking the eyebrows form an impediment to the intercession of the intercessors on the Day of Resurrection?",
      "question": "<p>Briefly, I read your fatwa having to do with intercession (21672), in which it says that there are some people whose intercession will not be accepted, and I immediately wondered whether I would be one of these people or not?</p>\n<p>Please note that, praise be to Allah, I pray, but sometimes I pray and sometimes I do not, then I go back to praying, then I stop again, and so on. But this time in sha Allah I will be one of those who persist in it. I do not listen to music, praise be to Allah. I watch Turkish soap operas, but I do not look at provocative scenes. But my fear is that I may be cursed because of my eyebrows, because I pluck my eyebrows and I remove excess hair from them. Will this form an impediment to the intercession of Ahl al-Bayt and of Sayyiduna Muhammad, or the mercy of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide you and enable you to offer the prescribed prayers regularly and not to slacken in that at all, and to enable you to do that in the manner with which He is pleased, for prayer is very important, to such an extent that it is the thing that stands between a person and disbelief (kufr), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Between disbelief and faith there stands giving up the prayer.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2618); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. It is also narrated by Muslim (82) as follows: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.”</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (429) narrated that Abu’d-Darda’ said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are five things; whoever does them with faith will enter Paradise: whoever regularly offers the five daily prayers with their wudoo’, bowing, and prostration, and offers them on time; fasts Ramadan; goes on pilgrimage to the House if he is able to do so; gives zakaah willingly and happily; and fulfils trusts.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Watching soap operas and movies is haraam and is not permissible. Claiming that you do not look at provocative scenes indicates that these productions may contain provocative and haraam scenes, so it is not permissible for a Muslim, man or woman, to expose himself or herself to that which will provoke temptation and cause them to fall into haraam, especially since most of what is shown in movies and other productions inevitably contains things that are contrary to Islam, such as uncovering ‘awrahs and listening to music, as well as being a waste of time in worthless pursuits. For further discussion of the prohibition on watching movies and other productions, and the negative impact they have on people’s beliefs and morals, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/125535\">125535</a>.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Cutting the hair of the eyebrows, or trimming it by cutting the edges, shaving them or plucking them for the purpose of beautification is haraam, because that is changing the creation of Allah and following the Shaytaan in his deceit of man and instructing him to change the creation of Allah.</p>\n<p>For more information on that, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2162\">2162</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22393\">22393</a>.</p>\n<p>With regard to cutting the hair between the eyebrows and excess hair that may be bothersome, such as that which may fall over the eyes and block the vision, that is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The namas that is mentioned in the hadith refers to plucking the hair and thinning it. As for merely removing excess hair so that it does not block one’s vision or in order to avoid harm it may cause by falling onto the eye, there is no doubt that this is permissible.</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (81/31)</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3928\">3928</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9037\">9037</a></p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>You should not entertain the notion that you are cursed because of what you have fallen into. Yes, the one who plucks the eyebrows or stops praying is exposed to that risk and deserves that because of his or her action, unless he is forgiven. But what you should do, and what makes sense for you to do, is to hasten to give up that which may bring the curse or the wrath of Allah upon the one who does it, and you should hasten to correct any faults you may have, and make up for any shortcomings you may have, whilst also repenting sincerely to Allah from what you have done in the past, and hastening to do good.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36674\">36674</a>.</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>Intercession on the Day of Resurrection will be of avail to whomever Allah wills of those who committed sins, acts of disobedience and major sins, among the people who affirmed His Oneness. We cannot be certain that intercession will be withheld from anyone except those who disbelieved and ascribed partners to Allah. There may be some sinners among those who affirmed Allah’s Oneness who will enter Hell for their sins until Allah brings them forth from it when they have been cleansed from their sins.</p>\n<p>Intercession for those who committed sins and acts of disobedience will not only be granted to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather the Prophets, the martyrs, the scholars, the righteous and the angels will also have a share of intercession.</p>\n<p>Please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21672\">21672</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/26259\">26259</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on that, we cannot definitively say that plucking the eyebrows or other actions that may result in a curse or punishment – Allah forbid – will rule out the intercession of those who intercede on the Day of Resurrection, whether that is the intercession of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or the intercession of others such as the righteous, good people of Ahl al-Bayt or others, especially since the Prophet&nbsp; (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “My intercession will be for those among my ummah who committed major sins.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood (4739); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood</p>\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n<p>What you should do, instead of making yourself anxious, doubtful and confused, and perhaps despair of the mercy of Allah or of attaining intercession, is to hasten to put things right between you and your Lord, think positively of Him, and turn to Him in sincere repentance, in the hope that He may turn your bad deeds into good deeds.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A person used to receive interest on his bank deposits. He later learnt it is forbidden (haram) and ceased to receive interest. Later on, he feels he should give out this money to complete the conditions for his repentance (tawba).</p>\n<div>However, there are two problems :</div>\n<div>1- He cannot calculate the exact amount of all the money</div>\n<div>he previously obtained from bank interests.</div>\n<div>2- The savings this person has now, are surely less than what</div>\n<div>he obtained from bank interest over the years.</div>\n<div>Given the above, please answer the following questions :</div>\n<div>1- Is it a condition of this person's tawba to give out the exact equivalent of all the money he received from bank interest ?</div>\n<div>2- If the answer to the first question is 'yes', then must he immediately give out any amounts as they become available (after providing basic needs for himself and his family) ?</div>\n<div>i.e can this person buy things that are not strictly necessities ('Darooriyyaat' i.e. shelter, food, clothes, medicine, transportation) but that are still important ('haajaat', e.g. computer) ?</div>\n<div>3- If the answer to the second part of the previous question is 'no', can this person perform hajj, before giving out the equivalent of this bank interest money, with any amounts that become available ?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>Those who eat riba (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan, leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like riba, whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire they will abide therein.</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:275]</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said concerning the phrase So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past: This means: whoever hears that Allah has forbidden riba should stop as soon as this ruling reaches him, but he can keep whatever he had received before, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Allah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95]. Similarly, on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: All riba owing from the time of Jaahiliyyah is under these two feet of mine (when he abolished everything that was owed to the usurers except their capital), he did not command them to return the extra money they had received during the time of Jaahiliyyah. (The phrase) (Allah) has forgiven what is past is akin to the phrase his case is for Allah (to judge). Saeed ibn Jubayr and al-Saddi said: Shall not be punished for his past (means) for what he used to consume of riba before it was prohibited.</p>\n<p>(Tafseer Ibn Katheer; the material in brackets has been added for the purpose of clarification).</p>\n<p>On the basis of the above, you do not have to repay the interest which you received before you found out that it is haram, but whatever you have received since then must be repaid if you still have it. If it has become mixed with your own money and you do not know the amount, then try to estimate what you think is most likely, and pay that amount.</p>\n<p>For more information please see Questions # <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/824\">824</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1606\">1606</a>.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to accept our repentance.

      "question": "<p>Why does belief in the Books come after belief in the angels and before belief in the Messengers in the hadith of the Prophet: “To believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in predestination (al-qadar), both good and bad”?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The first article of faith that is required of a person is to believe in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because if it is not established that this universe has a God, then it is not possible to establish the truthfulness of the Prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). So knowing Allah, may He be exalted, is the foundation, which is why Allah is mentioned first in this list of beliefs.</p>\n<p>Then, in many religious texts, belief in the noble angels of Allah is mentioned after belief in Allah, may He be exalted. The wisdom behind that is that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, only sent revelation to the Prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) through the angels, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“He sends down the angels, with the inspiration of His command, upon whom He wills of His servants”</p>\n<p>[an-Nahl 16:2]</p>\n<p>“The Trustworthy Spirit [Jibreel] has brought it down</p>\n<p>Upon your heart, [O Muhammad] - that you may be of the warners -”</p>\n<p>[ash-Shu‘araa’ 26:193-194].</p>\n<p>As it is established that the revelation of Allah, may He be exalted, only reached humanity through the angels, then the angels are the intermediaries between Allah, may He be exalted, and humanity. It is for this reason that the angels are mentioned second in this list.</p>\n<p>For this reason also, “Allah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:18].</p>\n<p>The third in this list is the Books, which refers to the revelation that the angel brought from Allah, may He be exalted, and delivered to humanity. So the angel is mentioned before the books, and the books are mentioned after that for this reason.</p>\n<p>The fourth in this list is the Messengers, who are the ones who received the light of revelation from the angels. For this reason, the messengers are listed in fourth place.</p>\n<p>This was discussed by ar-Raazi in at-Tafseer (7/108); see also: Haashiyat Zaadah ‘ala al-Baydaawi (2/694).</p>\n<p>At-Teebi said: The angel is mentioned before the Book and the Messengers, following the sequence of events in reality, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent the angel with the book to the Messenger.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh al-Mishkaat (2/425).</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, this comes under the heading of subtle points of knowledge, and is not one of the pillars or foundations on which any beliefs or rulings are built.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>A menstruating woman does not need to do ghusl after having sexual contact, because her impurity lasts as long as the blood is flowing, and it does not stop until her bleeding stops and she does ghusl. While she is menstruating, her husband is not permitted to have intercourse in the vagina, because of the aayah (interpretation if the meaning): They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: That is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them until they have purified (from menses and taken a bath) [al-Baqarah 2:222]. The husband may enjoy (sexual activity) other than intercourse, because of the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that among the Jews, when a woman had her menses they would not eat with her or stay in the same house with her. The Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked him about this, and Allaah revealed the aayah, They ask you concerning menstruation.

      "question": "<p>If a man wants to slaughter a chicken, does he have to make it face toward the qiblah or may he slaughter it no matter what direction it is facing?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Sunnah with regard to     slaughter is to make the animal face towards the qiblah, but that is not     obligatory. If he slaughters it facing any other direction, his slaughter is     halaal, but he has omitted a Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad (15022), Abu Dawood     (2785) and Ibn Maajah (3121) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allah     be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) sacrificed two rams on the day of Eid. When he turned     them to face towards the qiblah he said: “Verily, I have turned my face     towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth Haneefa (Islamic     Monotheism, i.e. worshipping none but Allaah Alone), and I am not of     Al-Mushrikoon .Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my     dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that     exists). He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the     first of the Muslims’ [cf. al-An’aam 6:79, 162-163]. O Allaah, from You and     to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his ummah. In the name of Allah and Allah     is most great.” Then he slaughtered them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The isnaad of this hadeeth     may reach the level of hasan as Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot said in Tahqeeq al-Musnad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo’ah     al-Fiqhiyyah (21/196), explaining the etiquette of slaughtering:</p>\n<p>The slaughterer should face     towards the qiblah and the animal’s neck should be turned to face the     qiblah, because Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) disliked eating     the meat of any animal that had been slaughtered facing any direction other     than the qiblah, and no one among the Sahaabah disagreed with him. That is     narrated in some reports from Ibn Sireen and Jaabir ibn Zayd. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Mughni,     3/221&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Fataawa     al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (22/477) concerning one who slaughters an animal     facing a direction other than the qiblah and claims that making it face the     qiblah applies only when slaughtering the hadiy:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the situation with     regard to slaughter is as you say, then the slaughter is sound and valid in     terms of it being halaal, but the slaughterer is going against the Sunnah by     not turning to face the qiblah with the animal at the time of slaughter, and     he is doing wrong by not accepting the advice, and he is mistaken in his     claim that making it face the qiblah applies only when slaughtering the     hadiy, because the Sunnah is to turn towards the qiblah with the animal at     the time of slaughter in all cases, whether it is a hadiy or a sacrifice or     otherwise. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It also says (1/67): It is     mustahabb for the slaughterer to face towards the qiblah&nbsp; and to make the     animal also face towards the qiblah, because it is the noblest of     directions, and because turning to face the qiblah is mustahabb in acts of     worship, except in cases where there is evidence to indicate otherwise. The     fact that this is mustahabb is particularly emphasized if it is a hadiy or     udhiyah. It is narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “Offer your     sacrifices and be of good cheer, for there is no Muslim who turns his     sacrifice to face the qiblah but its blood and dung and wool will be     hasanaat that are present on his scales on the Day of Resurrection.” And he     used to say: “Spend a little, you will be rewarded a great deal.” This     hadeeth was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf, and     al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and al-Bayhaqi narrated something similar. Although     the imams of hadeeth suggested that its isnaad is weak, it may be acted upon     with regard to encouraging good deeds. Hence Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn Sireen     regarded it as makrooh to eat meat that was not facing the qiblah at the     time of slaughter. Limiting oneself to saying Bismillaah and letting the     animal face any direction at the time of slaughter is forsaking that which     is better, but the slaughter is still valid. This was the view of al-Qaasim     ibn Muhammad, al-Nakha’i, al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mundhir and others. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I have a question about platforms for financing through loans, some of which are in accordance with Islamic rulings, such as the Digital platform and the Lendo platform, based on the view of the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB) in Bahrain, which includes Drs. Al-Muzayni, ash-Shalhoob and al-Qarri. My question is: is the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB) a reliable source for shar‘i verdicts, or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>After checking the website for the Lendo platform, we did not find any details on how they operate, but based on what we did see, we may note the following two points:</p>\n<p>1.. The platform buys invoices that are owed by the company that is requesting financing, but there are no details on the website about how that is done, but the basic principle is that buying debts is haraam.</p>\n<p>2.. The platform goes and buys whatever product the investor wants, then sells it on credit to the company that is requesting financing, then they sell it on behalf of that company to another trader, so that the company in question can obtain cash.</p>\n<p>This comes under the heading of organized tawarruq, which is haraam. Statements on the prohibition of that have been issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Council and by the Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98124\" target=\"_blank\">98124</a> .</p>\n<p>Having said this in brief, we cannot give a verdict on what the Lendo platform does, or what the Digital platform does.</p>\n<p>We have no information on the standards of the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB). However, it is known that some shari‘ah committees may regard some things as permissible that others regard as prohibited, such as organized tawarruq, mixed shares, stipulating penalties for late payment, turning debt into something else, and so on.</p>\n<p>If you want our verdict on what platforms for financing through loans do, then give us details of the way in which they operate. One of the permissible ways is for the platform to sell items on credit to the company that is seeking financing, then the company can sell the items themselves in order to raise cash. This is the kind of tawarruq that is permissible.</p>\n<p>The company should not buy a product and give the invoice to the platform to finance it; rather it should make a profit-sharing contract (muraabahah) with the platform, so that the platform will purchase the product for itself, in a valid purchase, then sell it to the company by instalments.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Comments on the ban on the hijab and niqab in some countries, and the ruling on non-Muslim women being uncovered in Muslim countries",
      "question": "<p>It is well known what is happening now in France, and even in some Muslim countries, of opposition to hijab, which has become a focus of debate in some gatherings and TV shows, to such an extent that we now see some people saying: How can you ask others to give you freedom to wear the hijab in the manner you want when at the same time you are forcing them to wear hijab in your countries? It is the same thin. If you really think that forcing women to take off the niqab undermines personal freedom, then what you do here of forcing women to wear the abayah may also be regarded as undermining personal freedom. Do not be fanatical. You are not forced to live in their countries, but you have the right to migrate there, so keep quiet and accept their laws. I would like a convincing academic answer from you, as we are used to hearing from you concerning such matters. May Allah reward you with good for all that you have done and are doing, and may He benefit us by your knowledge, for indeed you are the best successors to the best predecessors. May Allah bless you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim who cares about his religion feels deeply hurt when he sees opposition to Islam and its symbols, not only from the disbelievers but even from Muslims who outwardly claim to belong to Islam. Among them are some who speak out of ignorance, and there are some who speak on the basis of evil and heresy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we compare the war on modesty and chastity in non-Muslim countries and some countries that claim to be Muslim, we will find that the enmity in the latter countries is more severe and greater, because they have promulgated laws that ban covering the head, whereas those non-Muslim countries – such as France and Belgium – have promulgated laws that ban covering the face only. There is a clear difference between the two matters. But the distress in the hearts of those who care about Islam was – and still is – due to a number of reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. These countries are supposedly Muslim, not Christian or Jewish</p>\n<p>2. They ban covering the head and punish people for doing so; they humiliate&nbsp; the chaste women who wear hijab, and prevent them from studying, working or seeking medical treatment.</p>\n<p>3. Their war on chastity and modesty is an old one; they were decades ahead of non-Muslim countries.</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the claim of some defeatists, that if we criticize the disbelievers for banning the niqab in the name of personal freedom, then how can we force their women to wear the abayah – or cover up – in our country, the answer to that is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. There is no country in the Muslim world that obliges non-Muslim women to cover their bodies when they go out in the street, except one country, namely Saudi Arabia. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to preserve this good and not let it change. As for the other Muslim countries, they do not oblige their own women to cover up, so how could they oblige non-Muslim women to do so?</p>\n<p>2. Wanton display and nakedness are not permissible for Christians and Jews according to the original teachings of their religions; the command to them to cover up is the original command in their religions.</p>\n<p>3. We do not criticise the disbelievers for banning face coverings for Muslim women, if their reasons for doing so stemmed from their religion. Rather we criticize them for several reasons, such as the following:</p>\n<p>a. they claim that they are secular and that they have separated church from state, so why are they fighting a religious symbol?</p>\n<p>b. They claim that they are protecting personal freedom, so why do they apply this to everyone who takes off her clothes or most of them, but they do not apply it to the one who covers her body or most of it?</p>\n<p>c. They are not fighting anything but Islam using the issue of how its women dress. These countries all have different types of clothing for both men and women, so why are the women of those religions and groups and sects left to dress as they wish, except Muslim women, who are being put under pressure with regard to something that is obligatory for them in their religion?</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those who oblige non-Muslim women to wear the abaya and cover up may be asked: have you obliged the women of your own country to do so? They will answer yes. They may be asked: Do you differentiate between a non-Muslim woman of one religion and a non-Muslim woman of another religion? They will say: No, we do not differentiate. And finally they may be asked: Does your religion enjoin you to do this? Their answer will be: Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence no one should criticize those who rule according to secularism or anything else for allowing non-Muslim women to go uncovered in their own countries, but those who rule according to sharee‘ah should not be blamed or criticized either. Secularism allows non-Muslim women to go uncovered, but the religion of Islam does not allow that, so the former allows them to do that and the latter does not. Hence wise people directed their blame and criticism to non-Muslim countries because they rule according to secularism yet despite that they ban the covering of the face, even though their own principles do not allow them to do that, let alone criminalize the woman who covers her face or those among her family who called her to do that or instructed her to do that. If that is not dictatorship or fascism or terrorism, then what is?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for anyone in a position of authority in any Muslim country to allow the uncovering of ‘awrahs or wanton display from anyone in his country. He is responsible for every sin that is committed in the area over which he has authority, even if it is committed by non-Muslims. There is to be no differentiation between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim woman with regard to preventing wanton displays or nakedness, just as there is no differentiation between them in terms of it being prohibited for men to look at them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the lessons learned from the hadeeth of Haatib:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Munayyir said: There is nothing in the hadeeth to say whether the woman was a Muslim or a dhimmiyyah (from a non-Muslim people living under Muslim rule); but because the ruling on the prohibition of looking at her unnecessarily applies equally to both (i.e., both the Muslim woman and the non-Muslim woman), the evidence refers to both.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (6/191).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was not a particular type of dress for non-Muslim women, because wanton displays and nakedness were not known among them; rather even the women during the Jaahiliyyah were not known to dress in indecent ways. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated clearly that he had not seen this type of people, when he said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen, men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, mumeelaat maa’ilaat walking with an enticing gait (or turning away from righteousness and leading others astray) with their heads like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor smell its fragrance, and its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (2128) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even if we say that we respect personal freedom, preventing the non-Muslim woman from dressing indecently and making a wanton display is not contrary to that principle – even if we go along with it – unlike banning the Muslim woman from covering her head or face, because that ban is contrary to the principle of personal freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Mahmaas ibn Jal‘ood (may Allah preserve him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For non-Muslim women to go out in the midst of a Muslim society with clothing that provokes desire and temptation should either be within the framework of civil laws or within the framework of personal rights; in both cases it is not permissible for non-Muslim women to be uncovered in Muslim society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Civil law is based on the obligation to respect the feelings of all people, and it is not permissible for anyone to provoke their feelings or desire, and cause pain to them. This manner of appearance of non-Muslim women in Muslim countries is offensive to people’s feelings and harmful to their spiritual wellbeing, whether the beholder is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. That is for two reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. If the one who sees those non-Muslim women dressing in a manner that is not chaste or decent is a Muslim, then he will see in that something which will provoke anger his this obvious violation of religious teaching and this kind ofconduct that is contrary to the rulings of Islam. If he is one of those who are weak in faith, he may feel sexually provoked which will cause him pain, embarrassment and hardship. No matter who he is, he is a sensitive human being, a man of flesh and blood, who is sensitive to what he sees and hears, and is affected by it whether in a positive or negative fashion.</p>\n<p>2. If we assume that the Muslims lower their gaze and do not look at this nakedness and indecent scenes, the male non-Muslims will feel provoked sexually, which may prompt them to commit crimes of various kinds in order to quench that desire, which they cannot find anything to quench or direct it in sound ways, because they are so far removed from faith and Islam</p>\n<p>In the case of civil laws that are based on Islamic sharee‘ah, it states that Muslims and ahl adh-dhimmah are equal in terms of outward moral duties, and no exception is made in that regard for the dhimmis apart from alcohol and pork. They may make and drink alcohol in private, so long as none of that or its harms affect the Muslims. And they may raise pigs, eat them and buy and sell them amongst themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This applies if we say that by not allowing the non-Muslim women to go out dressed improperly is in harmony with civil rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if someone were to say that going out in whatever clothes she wants to wear is one of a woman’s personal rights, we say that despite the weakness of this view for reasons that we have mentioned above, we may add that the personal laws of the Jews and Christians are based on the Torah and the Gospel, despite the fact that they have been distorted, and there is nothing in the scriptures to suggest that these indecent kinds of dressing and this ignorant wanton display is permitted. Muslim societies deal with ahl adh-dhimmah in a manner that allows them to practice their religion with regard to personal matters, but with regard to that which is proven to be prohibited to them and to the Muslims, it is forbidden to all of them equally. The extant texts in the Gospel that speak of this matter instruct women to wear a face cover and mention different sizes thereof and the Torah also says that Rebekah wore a face veil because she was a respectable woman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Muwaalaah wa’l-Mu‘aadaah fi ash-Sharee‘ah al-Islamiyyah (2/684-691); this is a lengthy chapter and we have quoted only part of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) was a scholar and critic of hadith who examined the reports and tried his best in doing so, but he was vulnerable to forgetfulness and error, like other scholars, and that does not detract from his standing in the slightest; rather he will be rewarded for that, by Allah’s leave, receiving a single reward. That is by the grace and kindness of Allah, may He be exalted, to the scholars and fuqaha’; He grants them a single reward for their mistakes, and grants them a double reward for what they get right. What matters is that researchers and seekers of knowledge follow the correct methodology in research and do not follow blindly; the status of a scholar does not prevent them from reviewing the evidence and conducting their own research, for academic research should be objective and neutral, and should only be based on real research and examination, and it should not be restricted to some particular names of great scholars, no matter how well versed and prominent they may be.</p>\n<p>Therefore we may say that Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) failed to point out the erroneous addition of the word “kareem” in the hadith about the du‘aa’ of Laylat al-Qadr, as the hadith was narrated via many chains of narration, and it was narrated by the authors of Jaami‘s, Sunans and Musnads, and not one of them mentioned this extra word “kareem”; rather all of them narrated the well-known version of the du‘aa’: “Allahumma innaka ‘Awfuwwun, tuhibb al-‘afwa, fa‘fu ‘anni (O Allah, You are forgiving, You love forgiveness, so forgive me).”</p>\n<p>But this mistake occurred in al-Albaani’s book Saheeh at-Tirmidhi (no. 3513) only.</p>\n<p>With regard to his book Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah – concerning which researchers are agreed that the research that was put into it was more precise and deeper than that of his other books, Saheeh as-Sunan and Da‘eef as-Sunan – the shaykh pointed out this erroneous addition and said:</p>\n<p>In Sunan at-Tirmidhi after the word “ ‘Afuw” there appears this additional word “Kareem”, for which there is no basis in the earlier sources or any other sources that were narrated from the earlier sources. What appears to be the case is that it is something that was inserted by one of the scribes or modern typists. It does not appear in the Indian edition of Sunan at-Tirmidhi on which al-Mubaarakfoori’s commentary, Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (4/264), was based, or in other editions.</p>\n<p>What supports that is the fact that in some of his reports, an-Nasaa’i narrated it via the same isnaad as at-Tirmidhi, as both of them narrated it from their shaykh, Qutaybah ibn Sa‘eed, without this addition.</p>\n<p>This addition also appears in an essay by our brother ‘Ali al-Halabi, entitled Muhadhdhab ‘Amal al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah li Ibn as-Sunni (no. 202), but it is not narrated by as-Sunni, because he narrated from his shaykh, an-Nasaa’i – as stated above – from Qutaybah, but he attributed it to at-Tirmidhi and others. What would have been more appropriate is to put this word between brackets, as is the practice nowadays, to highlight the fact that it was only mentioned by at-Tirmidhi. To be accurate, however, this word should not be mentioned at all except to point out that it has no basis.</p>\n<p>End quote from Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (13/140).</p>\n<p>Hence some researchers regard al-Albaani’s comment here, in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah – as constituting a clear retraction of his having regarded this addition as sound in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, whether you call it retraction or a conclusion that is separate from the first conclusion, what matters is that he stated the correct view and corrected the mistake.</p>\n<p>What is most likely to be the case is that this extra word, with which people are familiar, was taken from some editions of the books of hadith, not from the reports of the hadith itself, meaning that the scholars who narrated the hadith with this extra word “kareem” only did so because they found some manuscripts that contained the extra word “kareem”, as the commentators said concerning the Mu’sasat ar-Risaalah edition of Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (42/236): In “Q” it says “ ‘Afuwwun kareem.” End quote. “Q” is a symbol referring to a particular manuscript to which they referred. See their Introduction (1/104). Similarly, with regard to the al-Maknaz edition (11/6118, no. 26021), the commentators said: In “Q” it says “ ‘Afuwwun kareem.”</p>\n<p>Hence many scholars transmitted the hadith with this additional word in their books, such as: Ibn al-Atheer in Jaami‘ al-Usool (4/324); al-‘Imraani in al-Bayaan fi’l-Madhhab ash-Shaafa‘i (3/568); al-Khaazin in Lubaab at-Ta’weel fi Ma‘aani at-Tanzeel (4/452); Ibn al-Qayyim in Badaa’i‘ al-Fawaa’id (2/143); al-Khateeb ash-Sharbeeni in al-Iqnaa‘ fi Hall Alfaaz Abi Shujaa‘ (1/274); al-Ameer as-San‘aani in at-Tahbeer li Eedaah Ma‘aani at-Tayseer (4/268); at-Tahtaawi in Haashiyat ‘ala Maraaqi al-Falaah Sharh Noor al-Eedaah (p. 401).</p>\n<p>All of them narrated the hadith with the additional word “kareem” and without mentioning any isnaad. Some of them attributed it to Sunan at-Tirmidhi. This is assuming that the manuscripts were copied accurately.</p>\n<p>But today we have no doubt that this additional word is not part of the original text of the hadith, because dozens of books of hadith mentioned the text of this hadith without this additional word. We referred to editions that were checked against many manuscripts of Sunan at-Tirmidhi, and we did not find any reference to this additional word, such as the edition annotated by Bashaar ‘Awaad (5/490), and another edition annotated by Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot (6/119).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Taking interest to make up for loss of money’s real value",
      "question": "<p>Money looses its buying power as much as life becomes more expensive. For example, if life becomes 2% more expensive, the buying power of a 100 dinar today will be 102 in a year’s time. What is the ruling if I deal with a bank just to keep my money’s buying power, i.e. receive interest that just makes up the loss of my money’s purchasing value?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Undoubtedly the ever-rising cost of living means that keeping     money will cause it to lose some of its buying power. Hence you should look     for Islamically acceptable ways of investing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on the risks involved in investment and the loss of     trust in investment companies among many people, some of them have resorted     to putting their money in riba-based banks and taking interest. This stems     either from ignorance of the fact that this is haraam, or from preferring     this world over the Hereafter. Putting money in riba-based banks is gravely     haraam, because it is riba, for which the one who consumes it, the one who     pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it are all     cursed. It is the riba for which Allaah has issued a declaration of war and     divine wrath for the one who does it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains     (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.</p>\n<p>    279.&nbsp;And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war     from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital     sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you     shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:278-279]</p>\n<p>    Muslim (1598) narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased     with him)said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the     one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all     the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “A dirham of riba that a man consumes knowingly is worse before Allaah than     committing zina thirty-six times.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabaraani;     classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 3375.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In fact depositing one’s money in these banks is a loan with     interest. The lender is the customer and the borrower is the bank, because a     loan means giving the money then taking something else in return. Calling     that a deposit (wadee’ah) is an obvious misnomer, because the wadee’ah is     kept as is and is not disposed of, such as putting money in a safety vault     box for example, where the money itself remains and does not change. But the     bank disposes of the money as one who owns it, with the commitment to back a     similar amount, and this is a loan. If it comes with a commitment to pay     interest, then it is a riba-based loan on which there is scholarly consensus     that it is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:    “Every loan in which it is stipulated that     something extra must be paid back is haraam, with no difference of scholarly     opinion. Ibn al-Mundhir said: [the scholars] are unanimously agreed that if     the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay extra or give him a gift,     and he lends him money on that basis, then accepting the extra payment is     riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood that     they forbade every loan that brings benefits. End quote from     al-Mughni (6/436). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: Every     additional amount given in return for a loan or favour that benefits the     lender is riba, even if it is just a handful of animal feed. That is haraam     if it is stipulated. End quote.&nbsp; End quote from    al-Kaafi (2/359).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    A loss in the buying power of money does not make it     permissible to stipulate interest which is the essence of riba. Rather the     loan should be repaid as is even if its value has decreased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in Mawsoo’ah Fataawa al-Azhar, in a fatwa of     Shaykh Jaad al-Haqq, the former Shaykh of al-Azhar (may Allaah have mercy on     him) concerning the issue under discussion, which we will quote for the     benefit of readers:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Question: The questioner was given some investment     certificates of group (b) by his father as a marriage gift, and they are     still in his possession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He is entitled to cash them in now and they have profits from     the time he kept them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    His question is: Are they halaal with their profits?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please note that the cash value now with the profits is less     than their value at the time when they were bought and given.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: The fuqaha’ of sharee’ah defined riba as being     anything that is added to wealth without anything in return. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has forbidden riba in many verses of the Holy Qur’aan,     the last of which to be revealed, according to a saheeh report narrated from     Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), is the passage in which     Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Those who consume Riba will not stand (on the Day of     Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan     (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only     like Riba,’ whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba. So     whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Riba,     shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but     whoever returns (to Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will     abide therein. </p>\n<p>    276.&nbsp;Allaah will destroy Riba and will give increase for     Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allaah likes not the disbelievers,     sinners.”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:275-276]</p>\n<p>    It is also forbidden in the hadeeth which was narrated by     al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be     pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver,     wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for     like, hand to hand, and whoever gives more or asks for more has engaged in     riba; the taker and the giver are both the same.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because these texts imply that riba includes all additions to     the money borrowed or deposited on the basis of a precondition for nothing     in return, the Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is haraam, following     the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because the investment certificates of group (b) bring a     specified amount of interest, that is stipulated in advance in terms of time     and amount, they come under the heading of riba that is forbidden in     sharee’ah on the basis of these texts, as it is a loan with interest that is     stipulated in advance in terms of time and amount. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for what is mentioned in the question about these purchase     certificates and their profits being less than their value at the time when     they were given to the questioner or at the time when they were bought, this     is not a valid justification for regarding this interest as permissible.     Imam al-Isbejaabi narrated in Sharh al-Tahhaawi that the fuqaha’ were     unanimously agreed that if money is not taken out of circulation, but its     value increases and decreases, the borrower must give what he took in terms     of amount so long as the type of money is specified (Risaalat Tanbeeh     al-Ruqood ‘ala Masaa’il al-Muqood min Rakhs wa Ghala’ wa Kasaad wa Inqitaa’     by al-‘Allaamah Ibn ‘Aabideen (vol. 2, Majmoo’ al-Rasaa’il p.     58-67).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As this is the case, the nominal value of these certificates     is permissible, as it originally most likely came as a gift from halaal     earnings, as we assume that the believers are of good&nbsp; character and     conduct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the interest that was earned in accordance with the     system, it is riba which is haraam because it was specified, and it is not     permissible for the Muslim to benefit from this interest because it is     haraam earnings. He may take it and dispose of it in any charitable way such     as building mosques or hospitals or giving it to a poor or needy person in     the ways indicated by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to disposal of haraam earnings,     so as to free the Muslim of any responsibility before Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is narrated in a hadeeth that Abu Barzah al-Aslami (may     Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The feet of the slave will not move     on the Day of Resurrection until he is asked about his life and how he spent     it, his knowledge and what he did with it, his wealth and how he earned it     and how he spent it, and his body and what he did with it.” And Allaah, may     He be glorified, knows best. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Hence we say to our brother: You should either look for     Islamically-acceptable ways of investing the money, even if that is buying     goods which usually keep their value, such as land and gold and the like,     or&nbsp; by being patient and seeking reward, and putting up with the loss in     value that results from keeping money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to put money in a riba-based bank     except for the purpose of protecting it if there is the fear that it may be     stolen. In that case it should be put in a current account, not in a savings     account, so as to do the lesser of two evils. If interest is paid on it,     then you must get rid of it by giving it to the poor and needy or spending     it in the public interest, and it is not permissible for the owner of the     money to benefit from any of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to help and guide us and you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>How sound is this hadith: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water”? Al-Albani classed it as authentic (hasan).</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>This hadith was narrated by Ibn `Adiyy in <em>Al-Kamil</em> (9/114). He said: Ahmad ibn `Asim al-Balisi told us: Ibrahim ibn Sa`id told us: Yahya ibn Yazid told us, from his father, from Sa`id, from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water.”</p>\n<p>Then he said: This Yahya ibn Yazid ibn `Abd al-Malik has reports other than what I referred to. He is weak, and his father Yazid is weak, and the hadiths that I dictated to you are weak. The status of what I did not dictate is clear and most of it is not known.(<em>Al-Kamil</em>, 9/115).</p>\n<p>Someone other than his son narrated from Yazid ibn `Abd al-Malik, as was noted by al-Bayhaqi in <em>Shu`ab al-Iman</em> (5/67-68): From Dawud ibn `Ata’, from Yazid ibn `Abd al-Malik ibn al-Mughirah an-Nawfali, from his father, from Yazid ibn Khusayfah, and from Yazid ibn Ruman, from Sa`id ibn Abi Sa`id, from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “There is no charity that brings a greater reward than water.”</p>\n<p>This Dawud was classed as da`if by the scholars.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: all the narrators in the isnad of this hadith are weak, hence Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) determined that it is a very weak hadith.</p>\n<p><em>As-Silsilah ad-Da`ifah</em>, 1451.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There are hadiths that are similar in meaning to this hadith.</p>\n<p>It was narrated by Abu Ya`la al-Mawsili in <em>Al-Musnad</em> (5/77), Ibn Abi Hatim in <em>At-Tafsir</em> (5/1490) and others from Musa ibn al-Mughirah: Abu Musa as-Saffar told us: I asked Ibn `Abbas – or he was asked –: Which charity is best?</p>\n<p>He said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of charity is water. Have you not heard that when the people of Hell ask the people of Paradise for help, they will say: {Send down to us some of the water or other things that Allah has provided for you} [Al-A`raf 7:50]?”</p>\n<p>This is a weak isnad.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Musa ibn al-Mughirah from Abu Musa as-Saffar.</p>\n<p>He is not known and his shaykh is not known.(<em>Mizan al-I`tidal</em>, 4/224).</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (1679), an-Nasa’i (3665) and Ibn Majah (3684) narrated from Sa`id ibn al-Musayyib, from Sa`d ibn `Ubadah, who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which charity is best?</p>\n<p>He said: “Giving people water to drink.”</p>\n<p>A number of scholars stated that this hadith is weak, because its isnad is interrupted; Sa`id ibn al-Musayyib did not hear from Sa`d ibn `Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>Al-Mundhiri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Its isnad is interrupted according to all scholars.(<em>At-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib</em>&nbsp; 2/42).</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is mursal, because Sa`id was born in the year in which Sa`d died.</p>\n<p>This hadith has another isnad recorded by Abu Dawud and an-Nasa’i via al-Hasan from Sa`d. It is similar to the first isnad and is also interrupted.</p>\n<p>And it has yet another isnad recorded by at-Tabarani from Humayd ibn Abi’s-Sa`bah, from Sa`d ibn `Ubadah; it is also interrupted and is weak.(<em>At-Talkhis al-Habir</em>, 4/1705).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, all these hadiths have weak isnads.</p>\n<p>But Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that even though each of these hadiths is weak on its own, when they are put together, the text gains some strength. Therefore he determined that it is authentic (hasan) because of corroborating evidence, as he noted in <em>Sahih at-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib</em>, 960, 962.</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the hadith of Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him):</p>\n<p>Its isnad would be authentic (sahih) were it not for the interruption [in the chain of narration] between Sa`id and Sa`d, as noted above, and the interruption between him and al-Hasan – who is al-Hasan al-Basri – because they were not contemporaries either.</p>\n<p>There is a corroborating report to this hadith, namely the hadith of Abu Hurayrah which is narrated in <em>At-Ta`liq ar-Raghib</em> (2/52-53). Thus it is authentic (hasan).(<em>Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud</em>&nbsp; 5/368).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Even though the isnad of this hadith is weak, as noted above, giving people water to drink may sometimes be one of the best acts of charity, because the benefit of acts of charity varies according to the situation. Therefore providing drinking water in places and at times where there is drought and urgent need for water is better than giving high quality clothing, for example, in charity, because the benefit of water in such cases is greater, because it saves lives.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The best charity is that which meets the need of the recipient and is ongoing.</p>\n<p>For example, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best charity is giving water to drink.” This applies in a place where there is little water and a great deal of thirst. However, giving water to drink in a place where there are rivers and streams flowing is not better than giving food at times of need.(<em>Ar-Ruh</em>, p. 415).</p>\n<p>As for giving water on its own in all situations being the best kind of charitable actions, there does not seem to be anything to support that, and we know of no sound basis for such a view.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/227958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">227958</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is Moon Sighting Essential?",
      "question": "<p>Is it essential for the people to sight the new moon of Ramadan?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The majority of scholars are of the view that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/207382\" target=\"_blank\">sighting the new moon of Ramadan</a> on the first night of the month is a communal obligation, and if all the people fail to do it then they are sinning. This is also the Hanafi view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the jurists were of the view that moon sighting is recommended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Majma` Al-Anhar (1/283): “It is a communal obligation for the people to seek the new moon on the evening of the twenty-ninth of Sha`ban or Ramadan, and also of Dhul Qi`dah, and it is obligatory for the ruler to enjoin the people to do that.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyyah (1/197): “It is obligatory for the people to seek the new moon on the twenty-ninth of Sha`ban at the time of sunset, and if they see it they must fast. If it is cloudy then they must complete the month as thirty days.” (See Fath Al-Qadir, 2/313)</p>\n<p>It says in Kashshaf Al-Qina` (2/300): “It is recommended for the people on the night before the thirtieth of Sha`ban to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111873\" target=\"_blank\">sight the new moon of Ramadan</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is recommended to sight the new moon so as to be on the safe side with regard to fasting and so as to avoid disputes. It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the days in Sha`ban more carefully than at any other time, then he would fast when he sighted (the new moon) of Ramadan. “Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni with an authentic Isnad (chain of narration))&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) in a Marfu` report: “Count the days of Sha`ban for the sake of Ramadan.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi (678).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi: “Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They should strive to count its days accurately, and that is by means of watching the waxing and waning of the moon, so that they will be certain&nbsp; of when to expect the new moon of Ramadan and will not miss any of it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (22/23) it says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1584\" target=\"_blank\">Sighting the new moon</a> is something that is decreed by the fact that some acts of worship are connected to specific times. It is prescribed for the Muslims to strive in seeking it and it is more important on the night before the thirtieth of Sha`ban, in order to find out whether Ramadan has begun, and on the night before the thirtieth of Ramadan in order to find out whether the month has ended and Shawwal has begun, and on the night before the thirtieth of Dhu’l-Qa’dah to find out if Dhu’l-Hijjah has begun. These three months have to do with two of the pillars of Islam, namely fasting and Hajj, and the setting of the dates for `Eid Al-Fitr and `Eid Al-Adhha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged seeking the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/110350\" target=\"_blank\">sighting of the moon</a> . It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it and break the fast when you see it, and if it is too cloudy then complete the number (of days) of Sha`ban as thirty.” And it was narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The month is twenty-nine days, so do not fast until you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month as thirty days.” The first Hadith enjoins fasting the month of Ramadan when its new moon is sighted or when the month of Sha`ban is completed with thirty days, and it enjoins ending the fast when the new moon of Shawwal is sighted, or when Ramadan is completed with thirty days. The second Hadith forbids fasting Ramadan before the new moon is sighted or before Sha`ban has been completed if it is cloudy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And there is a Hadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he enjoined paying attention to the new moon of Sha`ban because of Ramadan. He said: “Count the days of Sha`ban carefully for the sake of Ramadan.” This Hadith shows the importance of paying attention to the month of Sha`ban in order to work out when Ramadan starts. It was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the days in Sha`ban more carefully than at any other time, then he would fast when he sighted (the new moon) of Ramadan, and if it was cloudy he would count thirty days and then fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The commentators said: i.e., he would make sure to count the days of Sha`ban carefully in order to begin the fast of Ramadan at the right time. During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and after he died, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) were concerned with sighting the new moon of Ramadan and they used to look for it. It was narrated that `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people sighted the new moon and I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that, and he fasted and told the people to fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with `Umar between Makkah and Madinah and we looked for the new moon. I was a man who had keen eyesight and I sighted it, but no one else claimed that he had seen it except me. I started saying to `Umar: Do you not see it? And he could not see it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hanafis regard sighting the new moon of Ramadan on the night before the thirtieth of Sha`ban as a communal obligation, and if they sight it they should fast, otherwise they should complete the month (as thirty days) and then fast, because that which is essential to performance of an obligatory duty is also obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hanbalis say that it is recommended to sight the new moons so as to be on the safe side with regard to fasting and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50487\" target=\"_blank\">so as to avoid disputes</a> . We did not find any clear view from the Malikis and Shafi`is on this issue.”</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Are all the Muslims sinning if none of them sights the new moon at the beginning or end of Ramadan?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/106492\" target=\"_blank\">Sighting the new moon of Ramadan</a> or Shawwal is something that was established at the time of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), because Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people looked for the new moon and I told the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that I had seen it, so he fasted and told the people to fast. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the way of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) is the best and most complete guidance.” (48 Su’alan fis-Sawm, no. 21)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So it seems that sighting the new moon of Ramadan, Shawwal and Dhul-Hijjah is a communal obligation, because it is connected to two of the pillars of Islam: fasting and Hajj.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "When will help and victory from Allah come?",
      "question": "<p>When will help and victory from Allah come? What are the means of attaining it?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah’s help to the Muslims against their disbelieving enemies who wage war on them is something real and true. Allah, may He be exalted, has promised that to the believers, and has told them that it is near, and that He only delays it for certain significant reasons. The one who has strong faith and true certainty will realise that it is indeed near as the Lord, may He be exalted, has told us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’ Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:214].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What this means is: Or do you think that you, O believers in Allah and His Messenger, will enter Paradise without anything befalling you like that which befell those who came before you among the followers of the Prophets and Messengers, of hardship, trials and tests? You will be tested as they were tested, with “severe poverty”, which is severe hardship and want, and “ailments”, which is pain and sickness. But you have not yet been shaken as they were shaken, i.e., you have not yet suffered extreme fear and terror at the hands of your enemy, so that you think that the help of Allah is slow in coming and you say “When will Allah help us?” Then Allah told them that His help was near to them, and that He would cause them to prevail over the enemy and defeat them. Then He fulfilled what He had promised them, and made their word supreme, and extinguished the flames of war lit by those who disbelieved.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tafseer at-Tabari (4/288)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned some of the lessons that we learn from this verse. They include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.The individual should not ask for help except from the One Who is able to give it, namely Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): “‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’”</p>\n<p>2.The methodology of those who believe in the Messengers is the same as the methodology of the Messengers, and they say what they say, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: “even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’” So they say the same thing, seeking to expedite divine help.</p>\n<p>3.The perfect nature of the power of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because He says: “Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!”</p>\n<p>4.The wisdom of Allah, as He withholds help for a certain period of time, even though it is near.</p>\n<p>5.Patience at the time of calamity for the sake of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is one of the means of entering Paradise, because what the verse means is: Have patience so that you may enter Paradise.</p>\n<p>6.The believers are given the glad tidings of victory so as to strengthen their morale, so that they will continue in jihad, hoping for the divine help that they were told about.</p>\n<p>End quote&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah (3/42)</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The help of Allah that is near is not for everyone who claims to believe or claims to be a Muslim; rather it is only for those who truly believe in their hearts and carry out their duties as enjoined by Islam.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).</p>\n<p>And perform As-Salat (Iqamat as-Salat), and give Zakat and obey the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) that you may receive mercy (from Allah)”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:55, 56].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a promise from Allah to His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that He will cause his ummah to gain authority in the land, i.e., become leaders of people and rulers over them, and by means of them the people’s affairs will be put right and the people will submit to their rule, and after having being afraid of the people, they will enjoy security and will rule over them. And He, may He be glorified and exalted, did indeed do that, may He be praised. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not pass away until Allah enabled him to conquer Makkah, Khaybar, Bahrain, the entire Arabian Peninsula and all of the land of Yemen; he took the jizyah from the Magians of Hajar and from some of the border regions of greater Syria. Heraclius, the ruler of Byzantium, exchanged gifts with him, as did the ruler of Egypt and Alexandria, al-Muqawqis, the kings of Oman, and the Negus, the ruler of Abyssinia, who came to the throne after Ashamah, may Allah have mercy on him and honour him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away, and Allah chose for him that which is with Him of honour, Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq became the ruler (caliph) of the Muslims. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer (6/77)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>This is one of the true promises of Allah, that was proven to be true and was fulfilled. He promised those among this ummah who adhered to faith and did righteous deeds that He would grant them succession to the present rulers in the earth, and they would have control of it and be in charge of its affairs, and that He would grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them, namely the religion of Islam, which is superior to all other religions. He has chosen it for this ummah, because of its virtue and honour, by enabling this ummah to establish His religion and to adhere to all its teachings and instructions, both apparent and hidden, and to apply them to themselves and to others, because others – namely the followers of other religions and all disbelievers – are subjugated and defeated. And He has promised that He will give them in exchange a safe security after their fear, as one of them could not practice his religion openly and follow what he believed in except by exposing himself to the harm of the disbelievers. Moreover, the Muslims were very few in number compared to others, and the people of the earth had united against them and were plotting and scheming against them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah made these promises to them at the time when this verse was revealed, at which time they had not had the experience of having power or gaining control of the land, or being able to establish the Islamic religion and enjoy complete security, so that they could worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, and not fear anybody except Allah. The first generation of this ummah attained that level of faith and righteous deeds in such a way that they became superior to others and as a result of that Allah enabled them to subjugate lands and peoples, and they were able to conquer vast lands in the east and in the west, and they enjoyed&nbsp; complete security and control in the land. This is one of the dazzling and amazing signs of Allah. And this is still the case and will remain so until the Hour begins: every time the Muslims achieve a high level of faith and righteous deeds, the promise of Allah will inevitably be fulfilled; the disbelievers and hypocrites are only given power over the Muslims, and sometimes defeat them, because of the degree of shortcomings among the Muslims with regard to their level of faith and righteous deeds. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer as-Sa‘di (p. 573).</p>\n<p>See also: Adwa’ al-Bayaan by ash-Shinqeeti (6/36); Fath al-Qadeer by ash-Shawkaani (4/69)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the people are sincere in their belief in their Lord and their establishing His laws, that is indicative of how they will be when Allah, may He be exalted, gives them power in the land. These are the ones to whom Allah, may He be exalted, has promised His help and support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order for Iqamat-as-Salat. (i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salat (prayers) (the males in mosques)), to pay the Zakat and they enjoin Al-Maroof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) (i.e. they make the Quran as the law of their country in all the spheres of life). And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures)”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:41].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting verses which mention the help of Allah, may He be exalted, to the believers:</p>\n<p>The words “Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land” [al-Hajj 22:41] indicate that there is no promise of help from Allah unless the believers establish prayer, give zakaah, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. If Allah gives power in the land to some people, and grants them authority, yet despite that they do not establish prayer or give zakaah or enjoin what is right or forbid what is wrong, then they have no promise of help from Allah, because they are not counted as belonging to His party or as being among His close friends to whom He has promised His help. Rather they are the party and close friends of the Shaytaan. If they seek help from Allah based on the fact that He has promised it to them, then their likeness is that of a hired worker who refuses to do the work for which he was hired, then demands his wages. The one who is like that is not rational at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says [in the preceding verse]: “Truly, Allah is Most Strong, All-Mighty” [al-Hajj 22:40]. The “Most Strong” is the one who overwhelms and is not overwhelmed by anything, as we have stated above several times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These verses are indicative of the validity of the caliphate of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs: Allah helped them against their enemies because they supported His religion, and they established prayer, gave zakaah, enjoined what is right and forbade what is wrong. So Allah gave them power and caused them to succeed the former rulers in the land, as He says:</p>\n<p>“Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:55].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The truth is that the verses mentioned above include the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as well as those who support the religion of Allah in the most perfect manner. And Allah knows best. End quote.</p>\n<p>Adwa’ al-Bayaan (5/272)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, it must be understood that there are means of attaining divine help; whoever wants divine help without taking these measures is acting in a manner contrary to Islamic teaching and common sense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Sa‘eed ibn ‘Ali ibn Wahb al-Qahtaani (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>It is known for certain that there are means of attaining divine help for the Muslims against our enemies, by Allah’s leave. These means include the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.Faith and righteous deeds&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion, that which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:55].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.Supporting the religion of Allah, may He be exalted&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the greatest means of attaining divine help is supporting the religion of Allah, may He be exalted, and adhering to it in word, belief and deed, and calling others to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.</p>\n<p>But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain”</p>\n<p>[Muhammad 47:7, 8].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.Putting one’s trust in Allah whilst taking appropriate measures</p>\n<p>Putting one’s trust in Allah whilst making ready one’s resources is one of the greatest factors in victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah, certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)”</p>\n<p>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:159].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an essential part of putting one’s trust in Allah to take appropriate measures, because putting one’s trust in Him is based on two important foundations:</p>\n<p>(i)depending on Allah and trusting in His promise and help</p>\n<p>(ii)taking appropriate measures as prescribed in Islam. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery, etc.) to threaten the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others besides whom, you may not know but whom Allah does know. And whatever you shall spend in the Cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you, and you shall not be treated unjustly”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:60].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.Mutual consultation among those in authority to mobilise and prepare the Muslim armies&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to consult his companions, despite the fact that his reasoning was perfect and his opinion was sound, in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted, and so as to make his companions feel included in the decision-making process. Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“and who (conduct) their affairs by mutual consultation”</p>\n<p>[ash-Shoora 42:38].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.Standing firm when meeting the enemy in battle&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the factors of divine help is standing firm when meeting the enemy in battle, and not fleeing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, do not wish to meet the enemy, and ask Allah to keep you safe and sound, but if you do meet them, then be patient and steadfast, and know that Paradise lies in the shade of the swords.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6.Courage, heroism and self-sacrifice&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among the greatest means of attaining divine help is acquiring the characteristics of courage and self-sacrifice, and believing that jihad neither brings forward nor puts back the time of death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisa’ 4:78].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7.Du ‘aa’ (supplication) and remembering Allah (dhikr) a great deal&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among the greatest and most powerful factors of victory is seeking the help of Allah and remembering Him a great deal, because He is the Most Strong Who is able to defeat His enemies and grant victory to His close friends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad SAW) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:186].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8.Obedience to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obedience to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is one of the greatest factors of victory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (SAW), fears Allah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful ones”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:52].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.Being united and not differing&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mujaahideen must fulfil the factors of attaining divine help and victory, especially relying on Allah and helping one another, and avoiding disputes and division.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not dispute (with one another) lest you lose courage and your strength depart, and be patient. Surely, Allah is with those who are As-Saabirin (the patient ones, etc.)”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:46].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp;Patience and steadfastness&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is essential to be patient in all our affairs, and especially to be patient when fighting the enemies of Allah and His Messenger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe!

This means that a person makes his fear of Allah’s wrath, anger and punishment a barrier that will protect him from that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Doing all obligatory duties and following them up with naafil (supererogatory) actions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>Following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in all beliefs, words and deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sixthly:</p>\n<p>Du‘aa’ (supplication) and beseeching Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Jihad fi Sabeel-Allah: Fadluhu wa Maraatibuhu wa Asbaab an-Nasr ‘ala al-A‘da’, by Shaykh Sa‘eed ibn ‘Ali ibn Wahb al-Qahtaani (p. 21-30_&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn, etc), and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [Al-Maidah 5:90]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_hadith_says_about_prohibition_of_alcohol\">What hadith says about prohibition of alcohol?</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allah has cursed the drinker of alcohol. In Sunan Abi Dawud (3189) it is narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9411\" target=\"_blank\">the one who buys it</a> , the one squeezes (the grapes, etc), the one for whom it is squeezed, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/96739\" target=\"_blank\">the one who carries it</a> and the one to whom it is carried.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani as stated in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/700.)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the one who is addicted to alcohol to one who worships idols.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is addicted to alcohol is like one who worships an idol.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3375; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2720)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The one who is addicted to alcohol will be denied admission to Paradise. It was narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who is addicted to alcohol will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3376; classed as sahih by al-Albani as stated in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2721)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>It was narrated that ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Avoid alcohol for it is the mother of all evils. There was a man among the people who came before you who was a devoted worshipper. A seductive woman fell in love with him, and she sent her slave-woman to him to call him to bear witness. He went with the slave-woman, and every time they passed through a door, she locked it behind them, until he reached a beautiful woman with whom was a child and a vessel of wine. She said, ‘I did not call you to bear witness, rather I called you either to have intercourse with me, or to drink a cup of this wine, or to kill this child.’ He said, ‘Pour me some of this wine.’ So she poured him a cup, then he said, ‘Give me more,’ and he did not stop until he had intercourse with her and killed the child. So avoid alcohol, for by Allah faith and addiction to wine cannot be combined except soon one of them will be expelled.”&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Nasai, 5666; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai, 5236)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27143\" target=\"_blank\">His prayers will not be accepted for forty days</a> . It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever drinks alcohol and gets drunk, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he drinks wine again and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he drinks wine again and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does that again, Allah will give him to drink of the mud of khabal on the Day of Resurrection.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is the mud of khabal?” He said, “The juice of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3377; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2722)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fact that his prayers are not accepted does not mean that the person’s prayers are invalid, or that he should give up prayer. Rather what it means is that he will not be rewarded for them. So the purpose of his prayer is to fulfil his duty and to avoid the punishment for not praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mandah said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The phrase “his prayers will not be accepted” means that he will not be rewarded for his prayers for forty days, as a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20037\" target=\"_blank\">punishment for drinking alcohol</a> . This is like what they said about the one who speaks when the imam is delivering the khutbah on Friday: he prays Jumu’ah [Friday prayer] but there is no Jumu’ah for him, meaning that he will not be given the reward for praying Jumu`ah, as a punishment for his sin.” (Ta’zim Qadr al-Salah, 2/587, 588)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to his prayer not being accepted, what this means is that he will not be rewarded for it, even though it is valid, and he does not have to repeat it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what the questioner was told about her fasting not being accepted, this is based on the view of some of the scholars that the mention of prayer in the hadith quoted above is a warning that no other acts of worship will be accepted either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is said that prayer was singled out for mention because it is the best physical act of worship, and if it is not accepted, it is more likely that other acts of worship will not be accepted either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-‘Iraqi and al-Manawi also said something similar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this view, fasting is not accepted either, but this does not mean that the person who drank alcohol should not fast, rather he is enjoined to fast, but it will not be accepted from him, as a rebuke.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the person who drinks alcohol should still offer the prayers on time, and fast in Ramadan. If he omits some of his prayer or fasting, he will be committing a major sin that is even greater than the sin of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/41760\" target=\"_blank\">drinking alcohol</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that if a Muslim commits sin and is unable to repent because of his weakness of faith, that should not be used to justify his persisting in sin or his addiction, or his neglecting to do acts of worship. Rather he has to do whatever he can of acts of worship and strive to give up the sins that he is committing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim has to fear Allah and beware of the wiles and snares of the Shaytan [Satan]. He should not let his soul become a plaything of the Shaytan. If his Shaytan overpowers him and makes him fall into sin and disobedience towards his Creator, then he must hasten to repent, for “the one who repents is like the one who did not sin.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2450; classed as sahih by al-Busayri as stated in al-Zawaid Hashiyat Sunan Ibn Majah)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This punishment for the one who drinks alcohol applies to the one who does not repent. As for the one who repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance and accept his good deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to protect us from the tricks of the Shaytan and to help us avoid temptations both obvious and hidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Does the judge have the right to rule that the father may visit his children on only one day of the week? Is one day sufficient to satisfy the father’s longing to see his children? Is this verdict based on the Sunnah of the Prophet or a command of Allah, may He be exalted?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The father has the right to visit his child who is in his mother’s custody, according to scholarly consensus.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em> (17/317):</p>\n<p>Both parents of the child who is in custody, if they have separated, have the right to see him and visit him. This is a matter concerning which there is consensus among the jurists, but they differ with regard to some of the details. End quote.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’</em> (21/205):</p>\n<p>If the wife has left the marital home or the spouses are separated by divorce, for example, and they have one or more children together, then according to Islamic teachings it is not permissible for one of them to prevent the other from seeing and visiting their child. If their child is in the mother’s custody, for example, it is not permissible for her to prevent his father from seeing him and visiting him, because Allah, may He be glorified, has enjoined upholding ties of kinship, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{ Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives …}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:36].</p>\n<p>And according to the hadith: “Whoever separates a mother and her child, Allah will separate him from his loved ones on the Day of Resurrection.”</p>\n<p>Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’</p>\n<p>Bakr Abu Zayd, Salih al-Fawzan, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah Al ash-Shaykh. End quote.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is no specific text from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to defining the duration of visits to see the child. Rather it is a matter to be worked out by jurists. For more information, please see: <em>al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em> (17/317-318).</p>\n<p>From these different views, it seems that the scholars pay attention to the following when working out times for seeing the child:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The best interests of the child in question</li>\n<li>Visits should be on a reasonable basis, so that the parent who has custody will not be harmed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore each case should be worked out on its own merits, according to the best interests of the child, the circumstances of the parent who has custody, and the circumstances of the parent who is asking to visit the child, in order to put an end to disputes that often occur between the parents because of these visits.</p>\n<p>If the shar‘i court decides on a time and duration for visits, then they must have worked it out on the basis of what is thought most likely to serve everybody’s interests. If the father thinks that the time allocated is unfair, then he must lodge an appeal so that his case may be re-examined.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The sharee’ah of Islam is an easy-going law     which relieves people’s hardship and makes things easy for them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and has not laid upon you in religion any     hardship”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:78]</p>\n<p>What you have asked about is not something that should cause any anxiety or frustration or     despair, because whatever happens to you is a test from Allaah and you will be rewarded for bearing it with patience. You should note that the     religion of Allaah is easy in all things. If this is what usually happens to you and you know that the urine will stop after five or ten minutes,     then what this means is that you should get up ten minutes before the time (for prayer) so that you can urinate and wait for it to stop, then you     can do wudoo’. If we assume that you get up late and you need to urinate, there is no sin on you if you urinate and wait for it to stop, even if     you miss the prayer in congregation, because in this case you are excused, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “There is no prayer when food is ready or when a person needs to relieve himself (of either urine or stools).” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 560).     Based on this, we say: Allow enough time before the time of prayer to let the urine stop, but if you cannot manage that then you should wait, even     if you miss the prayer in congregation, if you are desperate and cannot focus on anything else.

He was brought and flogged, then brought and flogged again, but he knew that this problem did not relieve him of his duty to     strive for the cause of Islam. So he went out with the Muslims to al-Qaadisiyyah as a soldier, seeking martyrdom on the battlefield. In     al-Qaadisiyyah he was brought to the commander of the army, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas, for having drunk wine. Sa’d detained him so that the Muslims     ranks would be cleansed of such a person. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This detention was a harsh punishment which     caused Abu Mihjan a great deal of anguish. When he heard the sounds of swords and spears, and the neighing of the horses, and he knew that the     jihad had begun, and the gates of Paradise were open, he was filled with longing for jihad.&nbsp; He called to the wife of Sa’d ibn Abi Waaqqas saying,     “Let me go and I promise Allaah that if I come back safe and sound, I will put my own feet in the chains, and if I am killed, then you will be rid     of me.” She felt sorry for him, so she let him go, and he leapt onto a horse belonging to Sa’d which was called al-Balqa’. Then he picked up a     spear and set off. He did not attack any group of enemy soldier but he scattered them. Sa’d was supervising the battle and he was surprised and     said, “This is the running of al-Balqa’, and the style of attack is that of Abu Mihjan, but Abu Mihjan is in chains.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the battle was over, Abu Mihjan went     back and put his feet in the chains. The wife of Sa’d told him this wonderful story, so Sa’d admired this man and his care for Islam and his     longing for jihad, so he himself went to this wine-drinker, released the chains with his own hands and said, “Get up, for by Allaah I will never     flog you for drinking wine again.” Abu Mihjan said, “By Allaah, I will never drink it again.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Isaabah fi Tamyeez al-Sahaabah,     4/173-174; al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, 9/632-633</p>\n",

My period began ten or eleven days before Ramadan this year, then I did ghusl after approximately nine days, then I noticed that it began again after two days. My grandmother told me not to fast at the beginning of Ramadan, and I did not fast the first two days of the month, then I did ghusl and fasted on the third day, even though the bleeding was still ongoing. That is because I think I read a hadith in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed a woman to pray after wrapping herself in cotton or heavy cloth, because it was not menstrual bleeding. I hope you can explain to me clearly what I should do.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The way to know whether a woman has become pure from menses is through one of two signs: emission of the white discharge, or dryness and complete cessation of bleeding. In that case she should pray and fast, then if the bleeding resumes, it comes under the rulings on menses, and she is not regarded as mustahaadah [experiencing non-menstrual bleeding) unless the bleeding is continuous, or it only stops briefly. This is according to a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (p. 275).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Based on that, you have to make up the days that you fasted whilst you were bleeding, if the bleeding did not continue for the rest of the month.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If the bleeding did continue without ceasing, then you are mustahaadah, and in the next month you should do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You should stop praying and fasting for the duration of your former regular period, then do ghusl and pray. Istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding] does not prevent a woman from praying and fasting, but she must protect herself by wrapping herself with cotton or heavy cloth to prevent the blood from spreading and contaminating her clothing or the place where she is praying.</li>\n<li>If she did not previously have a regular cycle, then she should learn how to distinguish between different types of bleeding, because menstrual blood is dark and thick, has an unpleasant odour, and is usually accompanied by pain (cramps), whereas the bleeding of istihaadah is lighter in colour and is thin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So menses is the days when the blood is dark and thick; as for the other type of bleeding, it is istihaadah.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If there is no difference in the type of blood, then she should stop praying for six or seven days, because that is the usual length of menses for women, then she should do ghusl and pray.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The woman who is mustahaadah should do wudu (ablution) for every obligatory prayer after the time for it has begun, and she may offer whatever naafil (supererogatory) prayers she wishes with that wudoo’.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/68818\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">68818</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Her husband spends his wealth on haraam things; can she take some of it without his knowledge to save it for the children?",
      "question": "<p>I have been married for ten years and I have two children. After five years of marriage, my husband began to reject me, but for the sake of the children I put up with it in the hope that he might come back to me. But I have found out that he is interested in other women. I gave up my job and travelled with him, and I did not tell anyone among our family. I tried to convince him to marry another wife and treat me in a manner that is pleasing to Allah, but he refused. I stayed with him for the sake of our children. Please note that he is a brilliant father and does not mistreat me, but I noticed that he spends a great deal of money on these girls. Is it permissible for me to take some of his money without his knowledge, to keep it for his children?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If your husband is spending on you and on his children, then it is not permissible for you to take any of his money, because it is haraam to take money except with the consent of its owner. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent”</p>\n<p>[an-Nisa’ 4:29].</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to one another, as sacred as this day of yours in this month of yours in this land of yours. Let those who are present convey it to those who are absent.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (67) and Muslim (1679).</p>\n<p>And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take the wealth of a Muslim unless he gives it willingly.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1459).</p>\n<p>If he falls short in obligatory spending, it is permissible for you to take that from his wealth on a reasonable basis, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) according to which Hind bint ‘Utbah said: O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man and he does not give me what is sufficient for me and my children, except what I take from him without him knowing. He said: “Take what is sufficient for you and your child on a reasonable basis.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5364).</p>\n<p>But if he is not falling short in obligatory spending, then it is not permissible for you to take anything of his wealth without his consent.</p>\n<p>So beware of taking from his wealth that which is not permissible for you, or of hiding anything of it, even if that is on the grounds of saving it for his children, because you have no authority to do that and the children have no right to their father’s wealth whilst he is still alive, apart from what is needed for their maintenance, unless your husband gives you permission to save (some of his money), in which case there is nothing wrong with doing so.</p>\n<p>So if you tell him that you are going to save any surplus from household costs for the children, for example, and he gives permission to do that, then there is nothing wrong with it, and it will come under the heading of a conditional gift to be given when one has the means to do so.</p>\n<p>You should also advise your husband to fear Allah, may He be exalted, to remember that He is always watching, and to take care of his wealth.</p>\n<p>You should also be wise in calling him to goodness and diverting him from evil; you should be patient and seek reward with Allah, and focus on raising your children. You should be patient in bearing what you dislike of his conduct, for that is better for you than destroying the household and causing hardship to the children.</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Know that there is a great deal of good in patiently bearing what is disliked, victory comes with patience and relief comes with distress and with hardship comes ease” Narrated by Ahmad (2803) and others, from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir and the commentators on al-Musnad.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answer to question no. 154172, in which we described some wise methods that the wife may follow in calling her husband.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide your husband and put your mind at rest.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>There are poor families who have grown-up children who are able to earn money, but they do not work on the grounds that this work is not befitting for them. Should they be given zakaah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to give zakaah to a poor person who is     able to earn a living, because he is not regarded as poor so long as he is     able to earn a living by working.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Adiyy ibn al-Khayyaar     from two men who were Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) that they came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) and asked him for charity. He looked at them and     saw that they were strong and said: “If you wish, I will give to you but     there is no share in it for one who is independent of means or one who is     strong and able to earn a living.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (1633); its isnaad     was classed as saheeh by al-Nawawi in Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (1/171) and     by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood (5/335).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in Fiqh al-‘Ibaadaat (1/295), which is a     Maaliki book: The one who is independent of means is the one who has what is     sufficient for one year, or he is able to earn a living, or he has a salary     that suffices him. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In al-Minhaaj ma‘a Mughni al-Muhtaaj (4/173) it says:     The poor man (faqeer) is the one who has no wealth and no means of earning a     living and meeting his needs. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever has     a means of earning a living that will make him and his dependents, if he has     dependents, independent of means and he has enough to suffice him every day,     is “rich” and has no right to zakaah. This is the view of Ibn ‘Umar and     al-Shaafa‘i … End quote from al-Mugni, 6/324&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But it is stipulated that the work by which he earns a living     should be befitting for him; if it is not befitting for him, such as if he     is one of the prominent people then he becomes poor, he is not obliged to do     work that is not befitting for him, so he should not be obliged to work in a     shop and the like. It is permissible to give zakaah to one who is like this.     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Ghazaali was asked about a strong man from a prominent     family who usually do not earn a living through physical work; can he take     zakaah from the share of the poor and needy?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He said: Yes, this is in accordance with what is mentioned     above, that what matters is a profession that is befitting for him. End     quote from Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, 6/175&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In al-Minhaaj it says: The faqeer (poor person) is the     one who has no wealth and cannot earn enough to meet his needs. And he is     still regarded as poor even if he can earn a living in something that is not     befitting for him. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The commentator al-Sharahbeeni said in Mughni al-Muhtaaj,     4/174&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    i.e., it is not befitting for him with regard to his status     and dignity, because it undermines his dignity, so it is as if (that job)     does not exist. The word ‘earning” in the hadeeth is to be interpreted as     referring to permissible and suitable means of earning. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    To sum up: with regard to people who do not work on the     grounds that the work is not befitting for them, if the work is indeed not     befitting to them, they may take zakaah. But if the work is befitting and     others like them do this kind of work without any reluctance, it is not     permissible to give them zakaah; rather they should be advised to work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "What is meant by sahoor in the hadiths that speak of its virtue is the sahoor of those who fast in particular",
      "question": "<p>With regard to sahoor in the hadith of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Verily Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels send blessings upon those who eat sahoor”, or in other hadiths, does this mean that the barakah (blessing) is only for those who fast, or is it the case that at the time of sahoor on any day it is mustahabb to have sahoor, even if it is only a sip of water?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Sahoor refers to the food or drink that is consumed by a person at the end of the night. It is called sahoor because it is consumed at the time of sahr which is the end of the night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lisaan al-‘Arab (4/351)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are a number of hadiths that speak of the virtue of sahoor, such as that in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat sahoor, for in sahoor there is blessing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1923) and Muslim (1095). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The difference between our fasting and the fasting of the People of the Book is the meal before dawn (sahoor).” Narrated by Muslim (1096). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels send blessings upon those who eat sahoor.” Narrated by Ahmad (11086); classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (1654)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by sahoor in these hadiths is the food eaten before dawn by the one who is going to fast in particular, because that food gives the fasting person strength for the act of worship that is fasting, and makes it easier for him. Moreover it is the sahoor that differentiates between our fast – us Muslims – and the fast of the People of the Book. This is understood from the comments of the scholars about the reason why sahoor is regarded as a blessing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars are unanimously agreed that it (sahoor) is mustahabb but is not obligatory. As for the barakah that is in it, it is obvious, because it gives one strength and energy to fast, and because of it one wants to fast more, because it reduces the hardship involved for the one who eats sahoor. This is the correct view concerning its significance.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim (7/206)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Verily Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels send blessings upon those who eat sahoor”: That is, those who eat sahoor with the aim of strengthening themselves for the fast, because of what it does of calming the desires of the stomach and private part, which leads to purification of the heart and dominance of the spiritual over the physical, which brings one closer to one’s Lord, may He be exalted. Therefore sahoor is very highly recommended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer (2/270)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/270):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sahoor is Sunnah for the one who fasts. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that there was consensus on its being recommended. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is prescribed for the one who fasts is to eat sahoor before dawn breaks, because that gives one strength for fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (9/26)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily in sahoor there is barakah (blessing).” Where is the barakah? All of it is barakah, for it is an act of worship, following the example of the Messenger, differing from the people of Hell, helping oneself to fast, and giving one’s nafs its rights, because it will be followed by a time of self-restraint, so it gets its share of food and drink so as to gain strength for carrying out an act of worship; it is the precursor to the fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (7/147)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The barakah in sahoor is attained in several ways: it is following the Sunnah, differing from the People of the Book, giving oneself strength to do an act of worship, increases one’s energy, wards off the bad attitude that may stem from hunger, is a means of giving charity to one who asks for it at that time or joins a person when eating, it enables one to remember Allah and call upon Him at a time when the response is hoped for, and it helps one to form the intention of fasting, for one who forgot to do so before going to sleep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fath al-Baari (4/140)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of these reasons mentioned by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) are not only applicable to the one who fasts, but they are connected to the intention of fasting, for the intention of fasting is the basis, which is followed by these benefits of eating sahoor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars are unanimously agreed that sahoor is mustahabb for one who is fasting, but we do not know of anyone among the scholars who said that it is mustahabb for one who is not fasting. If sahoor was mustahabb both for one who is fasting and one who is not, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have always eaten sahoor, but he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that, which indicates that sahoor is only mustahabb for the one who wants to fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Do I have to repeat the stoning? What is the ruling on stoning the Jamaraat with a piece of a big rock after breaking it into small pieces?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The majority of fuqaha’ stipulated that the Jamaraat should be stoned with pebbles, which are small stones of whatever type of rock. Concrete is not rock, so it is not acceptable, according to the majority.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is acceptable to stone the Jamaraat with anything that is called pebbles, which are small stones, whether they are black or white or red, and whether they are marble, flint, granite and so on. This is the view of Maalik and ash-Shaafa‘i. al-Qaadi said: Marble, buraam and kadhdhaan (types of rock) are not acceptable. And we may understand from his words that marble and solid stones are not acceptable either. Abu Haneefah said: It is permissible to use dried clay or mud, or anything that comes from the earth. Something similar was stated by ath-Thawri. It was narrated from Sakeenah bint al-Husayn that she stoned the Jamarah, and a man was handing pebbles to her, and she was saying takbeer with each throw. And she dropped a pebble, so she threw her ring.</p>\n<p>We also have a report that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stoned the Jamaraat with pebbles, and he told the people to throw pebbles the size of chickpeas, so nothing other than pebbles is to be picked up, and that includes pebbles of all types.

So it is not permissible to use gold, silver, iron, lead, wood, clay, seeds, dust, pearls, antimony or plaster in their view, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) threw pebbles and instructed us to throw pebbles the size of chickpeas, so nothing else should be picked up. The Shaafaa‘is allowed stoning the Jamaraat with all kinds of stones.</p>\n<p>The Hanafis were of the view that it is permissible to stone the Jamaraat with all kinds of things that come from the earth, such as stones, mud and clay, and everything with which it is permissible to do tayammum, but it is not permissible to use wood, amber, pearls or gemstones, because they are not from the earth. End quote.</p>\n<p>Based on this, there is nothing wrong with breaking stones or large rocks and stoning the Jamaraat with them.</p>\n<p>As for throwing concrete or pieces of brick, it is not acceptable according to the majority, although it is acceptable according to the Hanafis. However the view of the majority is more on the safe side.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on stoning the Jamaraat with pieces of concrete?</p>\n<p>He replied: Some scholars think that the stones that are taken from concrete are not acceptable for stoning the Jamaraat, unless this piece of concrete contains stone. If it contains stone then there is nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 23/125</p>\n<p>To sum up: If on the first day you threw pieces of concrete in which there was no stone, then your stoning was not valid according to the majority, and you have to sacrifice a sheep, the meat of which is to be distributed among the poor of the Haram; you may delegate someone to do that on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you cannot afford the price of a sheep, then you do not have to do anything.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The fuqaha’ differed concerning this matter and there are two views, based on their difference of opinion about making an intention specific. The issue is, does he have to intend to fast specifically for Ramadaan, or is it sufficient for him to have the intention of fasting, whether he intends it as an obligatory or naafil fast? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority of Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that he has to stipulate that he intends to fast for Ramadaan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hanafis are of the view that he does not have to have a specific intention. This was also narrated from Ahmad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this view, the fast of one who says “If tomorrow is Ramadaan then this is my obligatory fast”&nbsp; is valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Furoo’ (3/40): It is essential to form a specific intention for each obligatory fast, according to Maalik and al-Shaafa’i. This means that he should form the intention of fasting Ramadaan or making up a missed fast or fasting in fulfilment of a vow or as an expiation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each person will have but that which he intended.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another view was also narrated from Imam Ahmad, which is that he does not have to form a specific intention for Ramadaan, which is similar to the view of Abu Haneefah, because specifying is for the purpose of distinguishing and the time of Ramadaan is already distinct from other times, therefore the general intention of fasting is valid. If someone wants to form the intention of observing an obligatory fast but he was not certain … &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he said “If someone wants to form the intention of observing an obligatory fast but he was not certain”, such as if he formed his intention on the night of doubt by saying: “If tomorrow is Ramadaan then my fast will be obligatory and if it is not then it will be naafil,” this is not valid, according to the first view, until he is certain that he will fast tomorrow for Ramadaan. But according to the second view it is valid. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Insaaf (3/295): If his intention is “If tomorrow is Ramadaan it will be my obligatory fast otherwise it will be a naafil fast,” this is not valid. This is our view and it is the view of the majority of our companions. This is based on the fact that it is essential to form a specific opinion. It was narrated from Imam Ahmad that this is valid, and this is based on a report that says it is not essential to form a specific intention in the case of Ramadaan. This view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Taqiy al-Deen. It says in al-Faa’iq: This was supported by the author of al-Muharrar and by our Shaykh, and it is the favoured view. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Bahr al-Raa’iq, 2/280; Majma’ al-Anhaar, 1/233; Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 2/150; al-Mughni, 3/9; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 5/165, 28/22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the view of the author of al-Zaad: If his intention is, ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast’, that is not valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This issue is important and comes up frequently. For example: a man slept early on the night before the thirtieth of Sha’baan, and it is possible that this night may be the first of Ramadaan, so he said: ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then it will be my obligatory fast,’ or he said, ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then I am fasting,’ or, ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast, and if it is not then it is an obligatory expiation’ and the like. Our view is that this is not valid, because his words, ‘If it is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast’ show a kind of uncertainty, but intentions must be based on certainty. So if he does not wake up until after dawn and he finds out that it is Ramadaan, then he has to make up this day, according to the author.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second view narrated from Imam Ahmad is that his fast is valid if he finds out that it is Ramadaan. This view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). Perhaps this is included in the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr: “Go for Hajj, and stipulate that if you are prevented from continuing, you will exit ihraam at that point and Allaah will accept whatever you stipulate.” This man made his intention conditional because he did not know whether the next day would be Ramadaan, so his hesitation was based on uncertainty about the month, but there was no uncertainty about whether he would fast or not. Hence if he said on the night before the first of Ramadaan: ‘I may fast tomorrow or I may not,’ we say that this is not valid because it is uncertainty. … Based on this, if we go to sleep on the night before the thirtieth of Sha’baan , we may intend that if the next day is Ramadaan, we will fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/375.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>In 1996 I bought a shop for my brother to work in, but the shop has remained closed until now; my brother has not worked in it and I have not benefited from it. It did not enter my mind that zakaah may be due on it until recently. The price of the shop when I bought it was 400,000, then the price dropped to 300,000 in the year 2000. Now the price is between 700,000 and 800,000. In the coming year, in sha Allaah, I will try to open the shop so that someone can work in it and benefit from it.<br />\n<br />\n I hope that you can advise us as to whether zakaah is due on it or not. What can I do if I do not have enough money to pay zakaah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslim     does not have to pay zakaah on his car, house or shop, even if the value of     these things is great. Rather zakaah is due on things that are bought and     sold for the purpose of trade and profit, which are called “trade goods”. If     a person has any property or real estate – land, houses or shops – which he     has acquired for the purpose of trade, buying and selling, then he should     work out their value at the time when zakaah becomes due and pay one-quarter     of one-tenth. But if a person has acquired that property to live in, or to     farm it, or to rent it out or to buy and sell in it, then no zakaah is due     on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars     of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wealth that     people own is of various types. With regard to money, zakaah is due on it if     it reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab) and one hijri year has passed. In     the case of agricultural land, zakaah is due on the grains and crops on the     day of the harvest, not on the land itself. In the case of land or buildings     that are rented out, zakaah is due on the rent when one year has passed, not     on the land or building itself. If the land, building or other goods are for     trade, then zakaah is due on them when one year has passed, and you should     pay zakaah on the profit when one year has passed for the capital, if the     capital has reached the nisaab. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa     al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/331&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on     this, you do not have to pay zakaah on this shop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah     knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "They forgot to remember Allah at the time of intercourse; what should they do to protect the child from the Shaytaan?",
      "question": "<p>When I was reading question no. 125922, I discovered that there is a du‘aa’ that the husband should say when he has intercourse with his wife… I am now four weeks pregnant, but we did not say this du‘aa’; hence I am very worried. What must we do now, so as to protect our child from the Shaytaan? Is there something I can say or do that will take the place of that du‘aa’?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (6388) and Muslim (1434) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you wants to have intercourse with his wife, let him say, ‘Bismillaah, Allahumma jannibnaa al-shaytaan wa jannib al-Shaytaan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah. O Allah, Keep the Shaytaan away from us and from what You bestow upon us).’ Then if it is decreed that they should have a child, the Shaytaan will never be able to harm him.”</p>\n<p>This hadith contains a promise to the one who says that and is blessed with a child, that the Shaytaan will not harm him, but that does not necessarily mean that if a person does not recite these words at the time of intercourse that the Shaytaan will inevitably harm his child, or that the Shaytaan will inevitably have a share of that intercourse. The hadith does not say that; rather he has missed out on the virtue and protection mentioned here, but if he did not do that because of an excuse, such as if he was unaware of it, or he forgot it at that time, then he will be pardoned, if Allah wills, because of the promise that Allah, may He be exalted, made to the ummah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There are many ways in which the one who missed out on the virtue mentioned here can make up for what he has missed. They include the following:</p>\n<p>01.</p>\n<p>He can strive hard to obey Allah and obey His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in word and deed, to fear Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in secret and in public, and to seek halaal earnings, whilst constantly remembering Allah and reading or reciting Qur’an. All of that will guarantee – by the grace of Allah – that a person himself and his wife and children will be protected.</p>\n<p>Al-Haakim (3395) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82]: They were protected because their father was righteous; there is no mention of whether they were righteous.</p>\n<p>Classed by al-Haakim as saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim; adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab said to his son: I increase my prayer for your sake in the hope that you will be protected for my sake. Then he recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82]. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: There is no believer who dies but Allah will protect his offspring and the offspring of his offspring for his sake. Ibn al-Munkadir said: Allah will protect, for the sake of a righteous man, his children and his children’s children, and the households around him, and they will continue to be under the protection of Allah.</p>\n<p>When a person is preoccupied with obedience to Allah, Allah will protect him in that situation. End quote.</p>\n<p>Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (p. 187)</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi Shaybah (35374) narrated that Khaythamah said: ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) said: Glad tidings to the child of the believer; glad tidings to him, they will be protected after he is gone; and Khaythamah recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82].</p>\n<p>He also (36460) narrated that Abu Moosa said: al-Hasan recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82]. He said: There is no mention of his two children being righteous; Allah protected them for the sake of their father.</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82] indicate that the progeny of a righteous man will be protected, and the barakah (blessing) of his worship will benefit them in this world and the hereafter, and by virtue of his intercession for them, they will be raised&nbsp; to the highest degrees in Paradise so that he may have the joy of the company, as it says in the Qur’an and is mentioned in the Sunnah. End quote.</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer (5/186-187)</p>\n<p>02.</p>\n<p>Another matter to which attention should be paid in the hope that the child will be righteous is to release him from the pledge by offering the ‘aqeeqah on the seventh day after his birth, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah, which is to be sacrificed on his behalf on the seventh day, his head is to be shaved, and he is to be given his name.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood (2838); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.</p>\n<p>It was said that what is meant is that the ‘aqeeqah is a means of freeing the child from the Shaytaan and protecting him from him.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12448\">12448</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60252\">60252</a></p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The apparent meaning of the hadith is that he himself is kept in pledge and prevented and detained from some goodness intended for him, but that does not imply that he will be punished for that in the hereafter, even though he may be prevented, because of his parents not doing the ‘aqeeqah, from that which another may get for whom his parents did do the ‘aqeeqah. And the child may miss out on some good because of his parents’ negligence, even though that is not his fault. End quote.</p>\n<p>Zaad al-Ma‘aad (2/326)</p>\n<p>03.</p>\n<p>Supplication (du‘aa’) is another shar‘i means of protecting one’s children, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says concerning His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the Muttaqoon (pious)’”</p>\n<p>[al-Furqaan 25:74].</p>\n<p>Ibn Jareer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says: those who turn to Allah in their du‘aa’ and ask of Him by saying: “Our Lord! Bestow on us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes” by causing us to see them doing acts of worship and obedience to You. End quote.</p>\n<p>Tafseer at-Tabari (19/318)</p>\n<p>Then he narrated that al-Hasan and Sulaymaan at-Taymi said concerning the phrase “the comfort of our eyes”: (This refers to) the believer seeing his wife and children obeying Allah.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>So they ask Him to give them the joy of seeing their spouses and children complying with His commands. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ar-Rooh (p. 252)</p>\n<p>04.</p>\n<p>Ruqya as prescribed in Islam is a means of protecting one’s children. Al-Bukhaari (3271) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your father (Ibraaheem) used to seek refuge with (these words) for Ismaa‘eel and Ishaaq: A‘oodhu bi kalimaat Illaahi’t-taammah min kulli shaytaanin wa haammah wa min kulli ‘aynin laammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from every devil and every vermin, and from every bad eye)”.</p>\n<p>05.</p>\n<p>It is also worth pointing out with regard to this issue that children should be prevented from going out (after sunset) until it is fully dark, because that is the time at which the devils come out. It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the wings of the night spread&nbsp; – or when evening comes – keep your children in, for the devils come out at that time. Then when part of the night has passed, let them go. And close the doors and mention the name of Allah, for the Shaytaan does not open a closed door. And tie up your waterskins and mention the name of Allah, and cover your vessels and mention the name of Allah, even if you only put something over them, and extinguish your lamps.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5623) and Muslim (2012).</p>\n<p>The phrase “when the wings of the night spread” refer to the time after the sun has set, which is the first part of the night.</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad (14482) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Keep your children in until after it is fully dark, for that is a time when the devils come out.”</p>\n<p>The phrase “until it is fully dark” refers to the first part of the night.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, adopting the measures prescribed in Islam with regard to raising children is the basis for protecting them from the accursed Shaytaan.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He hears music sometimes in school without wanting to; is that a sin?",
      "question": "<p>I have previously stopped listening to music, by me not putting it on, but I hear it at school and other places, where I try not to enjoy it but sometimes I do?<br />\n<br />\nWould that count as listening, and would I be accounted for it or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>           There is a difference between the one who listens to           music and the one who hears it. The one who listens to songs hears them           deliberately, wants to hear them and enjoys that, whereas the one who           only hears the sound that reaches him, without wanting or intending           to do so, such as when riding in an airplane or a bus in which there           is music, or who goes to the marketplace and hears that from some stores           without wanting or intending to listen to it. There is a difference           between the latter and the one who sits down to listen to and enjoy           this haraam thing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           Hence Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: The command and the prohibition           have to do with listening. Merely hearing something is like seeing;           it has to do with the intention behind seeing, not what happens without           a person choosing it…. The same applies to committing sin through the           five senses of hearing, sight, smell, taste and touch; the commands           and prohibitions are connected to what a person intends and does, but           whatever happens without him choosing it, there is no command or prohibition           with regard to that.</p>\n<p>           (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, part 5, p. 566)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           One has to denounce that evil as much as possible, but           if he cannot do that, then he should denounce it in his heart. One of           the things implied by denouncing it in one’s heart is not remaining           in a gathering or a place where that evil is happening, if one is able           to leave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           With regard to listening to it, one must strive against           that as much as possible and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan,           and remember Allaah. Then Allaah will take that away from you. If that           makes your heart attracted to it, then you should keep away from those           parts of the school. If it will not cause you a lot of trouble to miss           some of those classes in which these things happen then you should not           attend them. You have to remember that Allaah is always watching and           fear Him, for whoever fears Allaah, Allaah will give him a way out.           Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to           Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)”</p>\n<p>           [al-Talaaq 65:2]</p>\n<p>           And Allaah is the Source of strength.</p>\n",

The symposium was held with the participation of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, the regional office of the World Health Organisation in Alexandria and the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture, 23-25 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1419 AH/13-15 October 1998. A number of senior jurists, doctors, pharmacists, specialists in biological science and scholars from the humanities participated in the symposium.</p>\n<p>Among the recommendations made were the following:</p>\n<p>3. Genetic engineering:</p>\n<p>The symposium has discussed the topic of genetic engineering and the reservations and fears with which it has been surrounded since its inception in the 1970s, because if it is practised without any guidelines or restrictions, it is a two-edged sword which may be used for good or for ill.</p>\n<p>The symposium thinks that it is permissible to use it to prevent, treat or mitigate disease, whether through gene surgery which replaces one gene with another or inserts a gene into the patient’s cells, or inserts a gene into another living being in order to replicate that gene in larger numbers so that it may be used to treat some diseases. However, use of genetic engineering on reproductive cells should be prevented, because of the Shar`i reservations concerning that.</p>\n<p>The symposium affirms the necessity of states providing such services to their citizens of modest income who need it, because it is very costly to provide.</p>\n<p>The symposium thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering for evil purposes or to cross the genetic barrier between different species for the purpose of creating hybrid beings for the purpose of entertainment or out of scientific curiosity.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the symposium thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering as a means of changing the genetic structure for the purpose of what is called eugenics, or any attempt to tamper with the genetic make-up of humans, or to interfere with an individual’s ability to be individually responsible. All of these are matters that are prohibited according to Islamic teachings. …</p>\n<p>The symposium does not think that there is anything wrong, in Islamic terms, with using genetic engineering in the fields of agriculture and animal husbandry, but the symposium cannot ignore the voices that have recently warned of the possibility of long-term harm that could affect humans, animals, agriculture or the environment, and it thinks that companies and factories that produce foods of animal or vegetable origin should point out to the public anything offered for sale that is produced through genetic engineering (or genetic modification – GMO), so that the purchaser will be aware of what he is buying. The symposium also recommends monitoring the consequences of genetic modification of foods, and they should follow the advice and recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration, the World Health Organisation and the World Food Programme in particular.</p>\n<p>The symposium notes the necessity of establishing organisations to protect and educate consumers in the Muslim world.</p>\n<p>In other recommendations, it says:</p>\n<p>12. The scholars of the Muslim world should write books simplifying scientific information about heredity and genetic engineering, so as to spread awareness and support concerning this issue.</p>\n<p>13. Muslim countries should introduce genetic engineering through a program of education at various levels, paying particular attention to university studies and postgraduate education<em>.\" (Majallat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami,</em> issue no. 11, Vol. 3, p.533)</p>\n<p>Based on that, there is nothing wrong with studying human genetic engineering and using it for beneficial and permissible purposes only.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers:&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21582</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111969\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">111969</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/119830\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">119830</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

So if the mosque is full, there is nothing wrong with the people praying in the marketplaces.\" (End quote from Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin,&nbsp;12/331)</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/107701/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conditions of the Validity of Prayer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/140208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Places Where Prayer Is Not Allowed</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/333\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Can You Pray in a Moving Car?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/147007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Can Muslims Pray in a Church?</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
