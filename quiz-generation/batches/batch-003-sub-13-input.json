      "title": "One should not exaggerate in cleaning oneself after relieving oneself",
      "question": "<p>I have a serious problem when purifying myself from major impurity, because I purify myself with a little water, then I wipe myself sometimes 21 times and sometimes more than that, yet I still see traces, which makes me purify myself again with water. Hence I spend a long time in the washroom in order to cleanse myself, which has damanged my health. What is your opinion? Is there a specific number of times for wiping oneself in order to become pure?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The phrase major impurity applies to janaabah (impurity following sexual activity), menses and nifaas (postpartum bleeding). The way to purify oneself from that is: the woman should start by cleaning her private parts, then makes the water reach all parts of her body. That is explained in the answer to question <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10790\">10790</a>. With regard to the emission of wind, urine, stools and madhiy (prostatic fluid), this is minor impurity, and perhaps this is what you are referring to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: Minor impurity is that which necessitates wudoo’ but not ghusl, such as the emission of urine, stools and wind from the back passage, eating camel meat, and sleeping.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for major impurity, it is that which necessitates ghusl, such as intercourse and ejaculation as the result of desire, as in the case of a wet dream or otherwise, or menses or postpartum bleeding.'(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 3, 4/112).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Istijmaar or wiping oneself means removing impurity on both passages, front and back, with a stone or a tissue and the like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is required in istijmaar is that the number of wipes should be no less than three, and to achieve purity, which is the removal of the impurity and making the place dry. The sign that purity has been attained is that the last wipe should come back dry with no trace of impurity on it. And if that is done, then the purpose has been fulfilled and the place has become pure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (262) narrated from Salmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade us to clean ourselves with less than three stones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/102):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both things are stipulated together: purification and completing three; one of them done without the other is not sufficient. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i and a number of others. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: If men use stones to clean the back or front passage, how can women clean the front passage when there is no water?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: Cleaning oneself with stones or whatever takes their place, apart from bones and dung, takes the place of cleaning oneself with water when purifying the front and back passage. Men and women are the same in that regard. What is required is three clean stones for both back and front. If that is not sufficient, then it is essential to do more until it becomes clean. It is best to make it an odd number, so if it becomes clean after four wipes, it is prescribed to do a fifth, and if it becomes clean after six, it is prescribed to do a seventh, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever cleans himself, let him make it an odd number.”(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 2, 4/36)</p>\n<p>But if what you mean by istijmaar is washing the traces of impurity with water, no number is stipulated in this case, and what is required is to wash off the impurity until you think that it has most likely been removed. In this case it is sufficient to act upon what you think is most likely, and it is not stipulated that you should be certain that it has been removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should note that this exaggeration comes from the waswaas or whispers of the Shaytaan, who intends thereby to make worship difficult for the Muslim so that he will give it up or his life difficult and make him fall into distress and grief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have to limit yourself to that which is mentioned in sharee’ah without adding or taking away anything. If the shaytaan whispers to you that you have not purified yourself, do not pay any attention to this whisper, until Allah takes it away from you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: For a believer must be an enemy of the shaytaan, fighting him and resisting him, and not giving in to him. If he tells you that you did not do wudoo’ and did not pray, when you know that you did do wudoo' and pray, and you can see water on your hand and you know that you prayed, then do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allah, and affirm to yourself that you have prayed and be certain that you have done wudoo’, and do not repeat any of that. Seek refuge with Allah from the enemy of Allah, the Shaytaan. Thus the believer must be strong in fighting the enemy of Allah and resisting him so that he will not gain any power over him or harm him, because if he gains power over a person he will make him like one who is insane and will toy with him. So what the believer, man or woman, must do is beware of the enemy of Allah, seek refuge with Allah from his evil and his tricks, and be strong and patient in doing so, so that he will not obey him by repeating the prayer or by repeating wudoo' or by repeating the takbeer and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly, if he says to you: Your garment is impure, or this spot is impure, or there is some impurity in the bathroom, or there is some impurity on the ground that you walked on, or there is such and such in the place where you pray, then do not obey him in that. The enemy of Allah is lying. Seek refuge with Allah from his evil and pray in the place where you usually pray and on the mat on which you usually pray and on the ground that you walk on, and know that it is clean and pure, unless you see with your own eye some impurity that you stepped on when it was still wet, in which case wash your foot. And praise be to Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to his whispers, do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allah. Remember that the basic principle is that things are pure. This is the basic principle, so do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allah unless you are certain that you have seen it with your own eyes, so that the enemy of Allah will not gain any power over you. We ask Allah to keep us all safe and sound.\"(Fatawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb, 1/77. 78 )</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to guide you and help you to do all that is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is zakaah due on honey?",
      "question": "<p>Does zakaah have to be paid on honey?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Some of the scholars – including Imam Ahmad – are of the view that zakaah is due on honey. They quoted a number of texts as evidence for that, such as the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – The report narrated by Ibn Maajah (1824) from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took one-tenth of honey (as zakaah). Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Ibn Maajah: (it is) hasan saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – It was narrated from Sulaymaan ibn Moosa that Abu Sayyaarah al-Muta’i said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, I have bees. He said, “Give one-tenth (of their honey).” I said, O Messenger of Allaah, protect it for me. And he protected it for me. Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1823; classed by al-Albaani as hasan li ghayrihi in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sindi said in Haashiyat Ibn Maajah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In al-Zawaa’id, Ibn Abi Haatim said, narrating from his father: Sulaymaan ibn Moosa did not meet Abu Sayyaarah, and the hadeeth is mursal. Al-Tirmidhi narrated in al-‘Ilal from al-Bukhaari that this hadeeth is mursal, then he said: Sulaymaan did not meet any of the Sahaabah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Abu Dawood (1600) narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: Hilaal, one of Banu Mut’aan, came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with one-tenth of the honey from his bees, and he used to ask him to protect a valley for him that was called Salabah, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) protected that valley for him. When ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab became the caliph, Sufyaan ibn Wahb wrote to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab asking him about that, and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) wrote to him saying: “If he gives you what he used to give to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one-tenth of the honey from the bees, then continue to protect Salabah for him, otherwise there is no protection and anyone may take the honey who wants to.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That was also narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah have mercy on him), but the most correct view is that no zakaah is due on honey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad was asked: Are you of the view that zakaah is due on honey? He said: Yes, I am of the view that zakaah is due on honey, (at a rate of) one-tenth. ‘Umar took zakaah from them. I said: Were they giving it voluntarily? He said, No, he took it from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Mughni, 4/183-184&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority of scholars, including Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, are of the view that there is no zakaah on honey. They classed as da’eef (weak) the reports that were narrated about zakaah being due on it. They interpreted the saheeh reports concerning that as meaning that the one-tenth that was paid was in return for that protection, as is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth narrated from ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on the tithe (one-tenth) of that which is irrigated by rain and flowing water, and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez did not think that anything was due on honey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz said in Fath al-Baari:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi Shaybah and ‘Abd al-Razaaq narrated with a saheeh isnaad going back to Naafi’, the freed slave of ‘Umar, that he said: ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez sent me as governor of Yemen and I wanted to take one-tenth of honey, but Mugheerah ibn Hakeem al-San’aani said: There is nothing due on honey. I wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez and he said: He is right, there is nothing due on honey. And a contrary report was narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, which was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq, but its isnaad is da’eef (weak). The first report is more sound. It is as if al-Bukhaari is referring to the weakness of the report, “One-tenth is due on honey.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari said in his Tareekh: There is no saheeh report about zakaah on honey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Tirmidhi said: There is no saheeh report on this matter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shaafa’i said: The hadeeth, “One-tenth is due on honey” is da’eef (weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is no proven report concerning honey, nor is there scholarly consensus, so no zakaah is due on it. This is the view of the majority. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), “If he gives you what he used to give to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one-tenth of the honey from the bees, then continue to protect Salabah for him, otherwise there is no protection and anyone may take the honey who wants to.” indicate that what he took from Hilaal was not zakaah, rather it was in return for that protection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali mentioned in his book al-Furoo’ (2/447-450) the evidence quoted by those who said that zakaah must be paid on honey, and he discussed the evidence and proved that it is da’eef (weak), then he said: Whoever ponders that and other texts, will clearly see that the issue is weak. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is zakaah due on honey?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The correct view is that there is no zakaah on honey, because that was not narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Rather it was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) guarded the places where bees lived and took one-tenth from the beekeepers in return. Based on this, no zakaah in due on honey, but if a person gives it voluntarily, that is good, and it may be a cause of his bees increasing in number and producing more honey. But is not an obligatory duty, such that a person would be sinning if he does not give it, because there is no evidence to that effect. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Zakaah, p. 87&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee was asked: Is zakaah due on honey that is produced by bees or not?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No zakaah is due on honey that is produced by bees, rather zakaah is due on its value if it is prepared for sale and one year has passed, and its value reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab), in which case one-quarter of one-tenth is due.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/266.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on working in the manufacture of pet food that contains pork",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to work in a factory that makes pet food, and this pet food contains pork?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly: It is permissible to feed dead meat to animals that are not eaten, such as dogs and cats, and that includes pork, which is dead meat in all cases, whether it is slaughtered or it died without being slaughtered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’ (4/336): It is permissible to feed dead meat to dogs and birds, and to feed impure things to animals. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to put out fires with wine, and to feed dead meat to falcons and hawks, and to clothe animals with impure cloths, and to use impure oils in lamps, according to the more well known of the two scholarly opinions, which is also the better known view of Ahmad. That is because using impure things is a way of using them up without causing harm. End quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra (1/433). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to sell pork, whether on its own or mixed with other things, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2236) and Muslim (1581) from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say during the year of the conquest when he was in Makkah: “Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and idols.” Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to feed dead meat to carnivores but it is not permissible to sell it. End quote from al-Majmoo’ (9/285). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about cans of cat food that contain pork – is it permissible to buy them and feed them to cats?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: If that is by buying the cans then it is not permissible, because it is not permissible to pay for pork and buy it. But if he finds it thrown away and feeds it to his cat, there is nothing wrong with that. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/5231\">5231</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, it is not permissible to work in a food factory where pork or other kinds of dead meat are used, because that is helping in sin and haraam things, as it is manufactured with the aim of selling it, which is haraam as stated above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:2]</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The reason why Quran is recited out loud in the nighttime prayers and silently in the daytime prayers",
      "question": "<p>What is the reason why Quran is recited out loud in Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers? </p>\n<div>What is the reason why it is recited aloud only in the first two rak’ahs of ‘Isha’ and not in all four rak’ahs?.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim is required to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and follow his example, whether he knows the reason behind a ruling or he does not. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:21]</p>\n<p>He should also be certain that Islam is based on great wisdom, but this wisdom may be known to us or we may be unaware of it, or we may know some of it and not the rest of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with a person asking the reason and trying to find out, because knowing it will increase his knowledge and peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars have pondered the reason why Quran is recited out loud in the nighttime prayers and silently in the daytime prayers, and the summary of what they have mentioned concerning that is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The night is a time when people are quiet, alone and more focused, so it is prescribed to recite Quran out loud at that time so as to make manifest the pleasure of a person’s conversing with his Lord, and so that the heart, tongue and ears will be involved in the recitation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This meaning is suggested by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah).</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;Verily, there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties”&nbsp;[al-Muzzammil 74:6-7]</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The point is that this rising may be at any time of night. What is meant here is that when praying at night, both the heart and the tongue are focused on the recitation, hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” i.e., the mind will be more focused when reciting and will understand the words more than during the day, which is a time when people move about and there is a great deal of noise, and it is the time of seeking provision. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (19/40) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant is that the heart, sight, hearing and tongue work together in harmony when reciting Quran, because voices and movements are stilled. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said (p. 1058): “Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” i.e., it is more likely to achieve the purpose of the Quran, where both heart and tongue are focused, because there are fewer distractions, one can understand what one recites, and does the prayer properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is unlike the day, when these purposes cannot be achieved. Hence Allah says “Verily, there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties” – i.e., going about to attend to your needs and living, which means that the heart is distracted and cannot focus fully. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There remains the wisdom behind reciting out loud – what is it? It may be that it is because night is the time when one is alone and people get together for lighthearted talk. So it is prescribed to recite Quran out loud at that time so as to make manifest the pleasure of a person’s conversing with his Lord. This applies only to the first two rak’ahs because the worshipper has more energy then. Because the day is the time of distractions and mixing with people, it is required to recite silently, because the daytime is not the best time to focus fully on conversing with Allah. The morning (Fajr) prayer is joined to the night prayers because its time is not usually a time when there are distractions, like Friday. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (2/91):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the distinction between the nighttime prayers and the daytime prayers, in terms of reciting out loud and reciting silently, there is great wisdom in that, because the night is a time when voices and movements are stilled, and hearts are focused and have renewed energy. The day is the time when people are busy with their day-to-day occupations, and the night is the time when a person can focus with his heart on what he is saying with his tongue. Hence the Sunnah is to make the recitations in Fajr longer than in other prayers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite between sixty and one hundred verses in them, and Abu Bakr used to recite al-Baqarah in them, and ‘Umar used to recite al-Nahl, Hood, Bani Israa’eel, Yoonus and similar soorahs, because the heart is more free of distractions when it has just been wakened from sleep. If the first thing that a person hears is the word of Allah in which there is all goodness, then these words will come to his heart which is free form any distraction, and will thus have a great impact on him. As for the day, the opposite is the case, so Quran is recited silently unless there is a reason, such as the large gatherings on Eid and Jumu’ah (Friday), and when offering prayers for rain and the eclipse prayer. On those occasions it is better to recite out loud and that is more likely to achieve the objective and is more beneficial, and because this serves to convey the words of Allah when there is a large gathering.

Allahumma ighfir li jiddi wa hazli wa khata’i wa `amdi wa kullu dhalika `indi. Allahumma ighfir li ma qaddamtu wa ma ajjartu wa ma asrartu wa ma a`lamtu wa ma anta a`lam bihi minni.

My ignorance and my transgression (in keeping my duty to You), and whatever You know about me better than I do. O Allah, forgive me for sins committed in earnest and in jest, by mistake and deliberately, and I have done all of that. O Allah, forgive me for what I have done in the past and what I will do in the future, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly, and whatever You know about me better than I do.

      "title": "Is the son of her husband’s daughter regarded as a mahram for her?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible for a woman who is over sixty to not wear hijab in front of the son of her husband’s daughter who is fifteen years old? He is like a grandson to her. Is it permissible for her to shake hands with him or kiss him? Her husband who is the grandfather of this boy has passed away.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly: The son who is asked about here is regarded as a     mahram for this woman, so she may shake hands with him and uncover in front     of him as she uncovers in front of her mahrams, and it makes no deference     that his grandfather is deceased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The way in which he is her mahram is that she is the wife of     his grandfather on his mother’s side. Permanently forbidden in marriage for     a man are his father’s and his grandfather’s wife, no matter how far the     line of ascent reaches, whether the grandfather is on his father’s side or     his mother’s, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except     what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an     evil way”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:22]</p>\n<p>It says in Zaad     al-Mustaqni’: The marriage contract makes the wife of the father and     every grandfather a mahram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in     his Sharh: The marriage contract is valid, and makes forbidden in     marriage the wife of his father or grandfather, no matter how far the line     of ascent reaches. Every woman who has been married by his father, even if     he divorced her, is permanently forbidden in marriage to him, and the same     applies to every woman who was married by his grandfather, whether on his     father’s side or his mother’s. The evidence for that is the verse in which     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except     what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an     evil way”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:22]</p>\n<p>If he marries her, that     is worse than zina, because Allaah says concerning zina (interpretation of     the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a     Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an     evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Isra’ 17:32]</p>\n<p>    But concerning this, Allaah says: “indeed it was shameful     and most hateful, and an evil way”. Marrying mahrams – Allaah forbid –     is worse than zina. Hence many of the scholars were of the view that the one     who commits zina with one of his mahrams, even if he is not married, is to     be killed. There is a hadeeth concerning that in al-Sunan. So the     wife of one's father or grandfather, not matter how far the line of ascent     reaches, is forbidden in marriage, whether on the father’s side or the     mother’s, and Allaah has not stipulated that the marriage should be     consummated etc, rather this ruling comes into effect by virtue of a valid     marriage contract. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/198&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a matter concerning which there is no difference of     opinion among the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him)     said, discussing the fact that a father’s wife is a mahram: It is the same     whether she is the wife of his father, or the wife of his paternal     grandfather, or the wife of his maternal grandfather, whether near or far.&nbsp;     There is no dispute concerning that among the scholars as far as we know,     praise be to Allaah. End quote from al-Mughni, 9/518, 524&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to kissing, she may kiss him so long as there is     no risk of fitnah, and it is better to kiss him on the forehead or head.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad (may Allaah     have mercy on him) was asked about a kissing a mahram man. He said: If he     has come from a journey and there is no fear (of fitnah). But it should     never be on the lips, only on the forehead or head.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn     Muflih, 2/266&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was     asked about kissing mahrams. He said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If kissing mahrams is done with desire or one fears that     desire may be provoked, it is haraam without a doubt. If there is no fear of     fitnah then there is nothing wrong with kissing on the head or forehead. As     for kissing on the cheek or lips, that should be avoided, except in the case     of a father and daughter or mother and son, for example. It is more lenient     in this case because Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon     ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was sick and kissed her     on the cheek, and said, “How are you, O my daughter?” End quote, from     Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 691.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows     best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on using American Express reward points",
      "question": "<p>I want to ask about the green American Express credit card, as it allows me to take as much as fifteen thousand riyals, but I am obliged to pay back the entire amount before the fifth of the coming month, and there is no percentage of the amount charged, but there is a withdrawal fee of 75 riyals for each transaction, and in the event of late payment, there is a fee of 150 riyals for each statement that is issued after the deadline for payment, up to 3 months. The final point is that American Express has now changed from charging a percentage to charging a fixed fee for late payments. Also, what is the ruling on using reward points from this card? May Allah reward you with all good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to use credit cards if they are free of the following problematic matters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Stipulating interest or a penalty in the event of late payment.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Charging a fee for issuing an “unloaded” (not prepaid) credit card that is higher than the actual costs involved.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Charging a percentage as a fee for withdrawals if the card is not prepaid. It is permissible to charge the actual costs only, and anything more than that comes under the heading of riba (usury).</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Buying gold, silver and currency with an “unloaded” card.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council has issued a statement concerning this matter. Please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/97530\" target=\"_blank\">97530</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to use the card asked about, because it involves paying a penalty in the event of late payment, even if the user is determined to pay on time. It makes no difference whether the penalty is a percentage or a fixed amount. Anything that is stipulated in addition to the debt is riba.</p>\n<p>According to the statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council:</p>\n<p>Firstly: it is not permissible to issue an “unloaded” credit card or to use it, if it is stipulated that interest be paid, even if the one who is requesting the card is determined to pay it off within the grace period.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>You have to stop using this credit card, and repent to Allah for having fallen into accepting riba and paying it if you actually have to pay the penalty.</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>If someone puts money in the bank in order to use it to pay off the credit card, then in effect that is a loan to the bank, so it is not permissible to accept gifts or rewards from the bank, or from the one who is cooperating with the bank, because that is a gift in return for a loan, and thus is included in the hadith, “Any loan that brings a benefit is riba.”</p>\n<p>See: al-Manfa‘ah fi’l-Qard, p. 461, and the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147775\" target=\"_blank\">147775</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on that, it is not permissible to collect reward points, unless that is done in order to get rid of them by giving them to the poor or needy, as is also to be done with interest, but one must also stop dealing with them, as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>If there is any hadith regarding extravagant which states Prophet Of Allah( peace be upon him)has said one should not use more water than required even sitting beside the bank of a river?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Imam Ahmad (6768) and Ibn Maajah (419) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by Sa‘d when he was doing wudoo’, and he said, “What is this extravagance, O Sa‘d?” He said: Can there be any extravagance in wudoo’?
