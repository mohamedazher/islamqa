      "title": "Our attitude towards rumours and news on the Internet",
      "question": "<p>How should we deal with the rumours that appear on the Internet? What is the Muslim’s attitude towards the news that we read here and there, and what is written in chat rooms, especially since some of it is good news for the Muslims, but the source is unknown.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We live nowadays at a time when many rumours that bring hope are appearing in the guise of news. These appears on Internet web sites and chat rooms, so that they may be spread to the people as glad tidings and so that good-hearted people may accept them as indisputable facts coming from trustworthy sources. Even if any of them could be proven, there are still many rumours that can be classed as no more than fabrications. The one who thinks about this will understand that many of the global media, including the Arab media, exaggerate in their coverage of some events and they analyze them in a subjective manner that shows a complete bias and evident absence of objectivity, trying to take revenge by adding to the news and exaggerating, and telling weird news stories. So there is no such thing as credibility in these media, especially when emotions and wishes play a part. This is apart from the fact that media objectivity has become a victim of this current war, and western circles have rejected the lessons [of objectivity, etc.] that they used to teach others. But this does not mean that we should dispute the facts or deny what is taking place in reality, or that we should face this bias with exaggeration and hopes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here we should pause and remind ourselves, and the good-hearted people who hear this news and tell it to others with good intentions – and those who fabricate these rumours and take upon themselves the job of propagating them – of a few facts. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – We must be certain about the news we accept, and we should not accept it simply because it happens to coincide with our hopes and wishes. We have our own methodology of verifying matters, and we should be consistent with regard to what we like and dislike. It is not right for us to doubt news accompanied by pictures from the battlefield, or to shed doubts on it, when the bottom line is one’s senses. At a time when you see news going around through mobiles from some internet web sites, there are some people who may accept such news but it should be noted that there are people who will never believe it. So they should beware of exposing themselves to being called liars. An old proverb says, “Whoever pursues weird news will be disbelieved.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – We have to be cautious about the fact that the source is anonymous. There is no information more important than that of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), yet despite that it is not part of the Muslims’ methodology to accept reports of the Sunnah from people who are unknown. Hence news must be taken from authentic sources; if it is not authentic then it should at least be known, so that people may be able to find out for themselves whether it is authentic or not. What a bad habit it is for a man to say, “I heard” or “they said.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – If there are people who permit the fabrication of rumours, basing that on some kind of ijtihaad, we must refuse to be the means of transmitting that by believing it and propagating it. (Whoever narrates a saying knowing it to be a lie is one of the liars).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – One of the reasons used by the fabricators to justify making up these rumours is that it is a kind of lying in war, which is permissible. They ignore the fact – of which they are not ignorant – that the only kind of lying that is permitted in war is that which misleads the enemy, not that which creates illusions and deceives the Muslims.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 – If we have lost some aspects of the battle, we must not lose truthfulness which is our capital in our dealings with others. People will be astounded and amazed if they find out that this false news was transmitted through a good man. Whoever is known to have lied or to have transmitted lies will no longer be in a position to be considered trustworthy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;6 – Similarly the righteous will be astounded and will become suspicious of a narrator who appeared to be righteous because he was telling this news and confirming it to them. At the same time, others will express joy, those who took the opposite stance to these youngsters and said, “This is their news, this is their credibility!” Everyone who was upset by the Muslim revival will find an opportunity to generalize this mistake and accuse all the pioneers of the revival of behaving like that. Please, for Allah’s sake, do not make the enemy rejoice or give them a reason to attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 – If truthfulness is an Islamic virtue and part of Arabic chivalry, then telling lies is an obscenity that Islam has forbidden. Even the mushrik Arabs refrained from telling lies, as Abu Sufyaan – when he was still a mushrik – said: “Were it not that I am afraid that people may find out that I had told a lie, I would have told lies about him.” That was when he was speaking to Heraclius (about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). He did not want to have even one lie to be found in his history, even if it was a lie told against his enemy Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Heraclius (the Roman ruler). We are concerned that the propagation of these rumours may lead people to record a lot of lies against us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8 – Fabricating rumours and believing them readily is a form of escapism in the face of a reality which one dislikes and with which one does not feel comfortable. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The soul finds consolation in denying that which it does not like and in fabricating and disseminating rumours, but in the end it will have to submit to the authority of overwhelming reality. But this psychological trick is not fit to be the means of escapism for the followers of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who taught them the virtues of truthfulness and commanded them to strive their utmost to be truthful. He said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will continue to speak the truth and strive to be truthful, until he will be recorded with Allah as a speaker of the truth. And lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell, a man will continue to tell lies and strive in telling lies, until he will be recorded with Allah as a liar.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9 – Delaying recognition of realities and veiling reality with illusions, the greatest form of which is believing and disseminating rumours, will only multiply the amount of losses, and the greatest loss will be the loss of values. The highest and most precious of those values is truthfulness. “then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them” [Muhammad 47:21 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;10 – Recognizing the truth is the first step towards dealing with crises and overcoming them, but not admitting them and concealing them are among the greatest means of reinforcing them, renewing them and repeating them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;11 – Our advice is not to transmit this news. We must advise those who transmit it with the best of intentions and present them with the real facts, we should not try to spare their feelings at the expense of our reason and the transmission of truthful news, and we should try to rescue them from the anxiety of illusion and point them in the direction of reality, because truthfulness brings peace of mind and lies bring suspicion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;12 – Sayyid Qutub (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reality of a thing defeats the outward appearance of another thing, even if it is the reality of kufr.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How I wish that I did not have to talk in this manner, but the problem is there and must be addressed. I have tried to be truthful when speaking about truthfulness, for the dearest of speech to Allah is that which is most sincere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)”</p>\n<p>[al-Tawbah 9:119 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>O Allah, show us the truth as truth and enable us to follow it; show us the false as false and enable us to avoid it. Guide us concerning disputed matters of truth by Your leave, for You guide Whomsoever You wish to the Straight Path.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammd and upon his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "He owes many expiations for breaking oaths (kafaarat yameen) but he does not know what some of them are",
      "question": "<p>I owe many expiations for breaking oaths, some of which I know and some I do not know, because I often swear to do something then break that oath. This has become a habit with me. How can I expiate for that even though there are many of them?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What is required of the       Muslim is to take the matter of oaths seriously, by not swearing many of       them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And make not Allaah’s     (Name) an excuse in your oaths”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:224]</p>\n<p>So do not swear oaths     except when necessary. The Muslim must protect his oath by offering     expiation if he wants to do something other than what he swore to do,     because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “By Allaah, if Allaah wills, I do not swear an oath and then see something     that is better than it but I offer expiation for my oath and do that which     is better, or I do that which is better and offer expiation for my oath.”     Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their Saheehs. This version was     narrated by al-Bukhaari. It was also narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Nasaa’i,     al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and Imam Ahmad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to numerous     oaths, if they all had to do with the same thing, then expiation only needs     to be offered once. For example, if you said, “By Allaah, I will not speak     to So and so,” and you said that many times, then you spoke to him, then you     only have to offer expiation once.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if you swore oaths     regarding several things, such as if you said, “By Allaah, I will not speak     to So and so,” then you spoke to him, and you said, “By Allaah, I will not     travel to such and such a place,” then you went there, and so on, then for     each oath you have to offer expiation. And you should try to be on the safe     side by offering expiation for whatever you think is most likely to be the     case, so that will have discharged your duty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah is the Source     of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad     and his family and companions.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "Definition of terrorism and what it means in Islam and in the West",
      "question": "<p>We have heard a great deal about terrorism. What is terrorism according to the Muslim view? What is terrorism according to the Western view? How can we debate with them if we differ with them concerning the definition?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Terrorism (Arabic irhaab) is a term that refers to scaring others. In and of itself it is neither good nor bad, unless the one who uses this word intends it to mean something and unless we see the consequences of the actions based on it. Whoever says that terrorism (irhaab) in Islam is synonymous with killing is mistaken, because the linguistic meaning of the word does not reflect that. Terrorism refers to scaring, not killing per se. In terms of Arabic usage, words derived from the same root as irhaab (terrorism) appear in the Qur’an where our Lord, may He be exalted, instructs us to fear Him, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “and fear [only] Me [wa iyyaaya farhaboon]” [al-Baqarah 2:40]. He has also commanded us to prepare to face the enemy from whom we expect plots against us and plans to wage war against us. This preparation is intended to scare (or terrify) the enemy so that we will not become easy prey for him. This is stated clearly in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows”</p>\n<p>[al-Anfaal 8:60].</p>\n<p>The unjust colonialist states use this word in conjunction with Islam, intending thereby to distort its image in the sight of all people. Hence they set up conferences and held seminars, and established research institutes in the name of fighting terrorism, but in all of these efforts there was no discussion at all about these criminal colonialist states who are oppressing the weak Muslims, such as the Hindus and their terrorising of Muslims in Kashmir, or the Russians and their terrorising of Muslims in Chechnya, or the Americans and their terrorising of Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Zionists and their terrorising of Muslims in Palestine. Some naïve Muslims have started to use this word to describe anyone they want to fight, and put people off him. They may be right in describing a particular group of Muslims as terrorists, but what about the states that use terrorism, and what about criminal racist organisations that have been spared from having this word used against them, which has become used exclusively in reference to Muslims?!</p>\n<p>The rulings and teachings of Islam were prescribed by Allah for the purpose of protecting the honour, life and wealth of the Muslim. For that purpose Islam forbids killing, theft, zina (unlawful sex), and slander, and has ordained severe punishments for anyone who commits those crimes. The punishment may go as far as execution – as in the case of the previously-married zaani (adulterer) – so as to protect people’s honour.</p>\n<p>There is a severe punishment for one who terrorises and frightens people, such as gangs of bandits on the highways and those who do similar deeds within the city. They are the ones who strive to spread mischief and corruption on earth. Allah has prescribed the severest punishments for them, so as to ward off their evil and protect people’s wealth, lives and honour. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:33].</p>\n<p>In fact, Islam went even further, as it forbids the Muslim to scare his brother, even in jest. It was narrated from as-Saa’ib ibn Yazeed that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one of you should take his brother’s property in jest or in earnest, and whoever has taken his brother’s staff, let him return it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2160) and Abu Dawood (5003); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla said: The companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that they were travelling with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. One of the men fell asleep, and some of them went and took some arrows that he had with him, and when the man woke up he panicked, and the people laughed. He said: What made you laugh? They said: Nothing, but we took this man’s arrows and he panicked. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to scare or alarm another Muslim.” Narrated by Ahmad (23064) and Abu Daawood (4351). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>“Terrorism” (irhaab) in Islam is of two types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is praiseworthy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This refers to scaring an enemy lest he attack the Muslims and occupy their land. That involves being fully prepared, arming themselves with faith, being united, and equipping themselves with weapons. The verse from Soorat al-Anfaal quoted above explains that it is obligatory for the Muslims to do this.</p>\n<p>Islam is not alone in this regard. Rather all nations compete in manufacturing arms and equipping themselves with weapons of mass destruction, establishing huge armies, and holding military parades to show off their troops and weapons. All of that is a show of strength intended to scare their neighbours and enemies, lest they think of attacking them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is blameworthy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This refers to scaring those who do not deserve to be scared, Muslims or others whose lives are protected by Islamic law, such as those who have a covenant with the Muslims, those to whom the Muslims have granted protection and safety, and non-Muslims living under Muslim rule (ahl adh-dhimmah)</p>\n<p>The Islamic Fiqh Council has defined terrorism as: acts of aggression and enmity carried out by individuals, groups or states by way of transgressing against people (affecting their religious commitment, physical and mental well-being, wealth or honour). That includes all ways of scaring, harming and threatening people, or killing them unlawfully, and all actions that are connected to those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, scaring wayfarers and travellers, acts of banditry, and all violent acts or threats that take place in support of criminal objectives, whether they are done by individuals or groups, with the aim of instilling fear and terror in people, scaring them by harming them, or exposing their lives, freedom, sense of security and well-being to danger. Another type of terrorism is damaging the environment, facilities, public or private property, or exposing some national or natural resources to danger. All of these are ways of spreading mischief and corruption on earth, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden the Muslims to do in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters”</p>\n<p>[al-Qasas 28:77].</p>\n<p>Sixteenth session, Makkah al-Mukarramah, 21-26/10/1422 AH -- 5-10/1/2002 CE</p>\n<p>In this statement, they pointed out two important issues:</p>\n<p>The first issue is refuting the argument of those who describe Islam as being a religion of terrorism. Among other things, this statement said:</p>\n<p>The members of the Council have noted that media campaigns are well orchestrated, and based on lies and nonsense, as they are organised by the types of media that are irrational and hostile, which are directed by the Zionist media organisations to stir up resentment, hatred and discrimination against Islam and Muslims, and to make false accusations against the final religion of Allah, foremost among which is the accusation of terrorism.</p>\n<p>It became clear to the members of the Council that accusing Islam of terrorism through media campaigns is but an attempt to put people off Islam, as people are showing interest in it and are entering the religion of Allah in crowds.</p>\n<p>The members of the Council call upon the Muslim World League and other Muslim organisations, and indeed all Muslims, to defend Islam, whilst paying attention to choosing the best methods that are appropriate to the honour that may be attained by undertaking this mission in the context of refuting the lies against Islam, and the accusation of terrorism. It may be noted that terrorism is a global phenomenon that cannot be attributed to a particular religion or people. Rather it is a phenomenon that stems from extremism of which no modern society is free. They explained that there are different types of extremism, such as political extremism, ideological extremism or religious extremism. Extremism that results from exaggeration about some issues of religion is not limited to the followers of a particular religion. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, mentioned the People of the Book exaggerating about their religion, and He forbade them to do that, as He says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Say, O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.\"”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:77].</p>\n<p>The second issue that the council discussed is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. This is a matter concerning which the global media is silent, and has not exposed the people behind it. Among other things, the council said in a statement:</p>\n<p>The Council affirms that there is another type of terrorism, which is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. One of its clearest and most abhorrent forms is the terrorism that is perpetrated by the Zionists in Palestine, and what the Serbs did in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosova. The Council regards this type of terrorism as posing the gravest danger to security and peace in the world, and regards confronting it as coming under the heading of self-defence and jihad in Allah’s cause.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>With regard to terrorism perpetrated by the West, it is what we read of and witness of their invasion of weaker states and the plundering of their resources, and what we see of torture, rape and killing, all of which is documented via audio and video media, in documents that cannot be denied. This is a continuation of their historical practice of occupation by means of force, violence and weapons.</p>\n<p>What is really strange is that Western states – especially America –have not given a definition of terrorism until now! It is clear that they would implicate themselves by any definition they chose. Therefore they have given this word a vague meaning, to be applied to whoever they decide to accuse of terrorism.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:</p>\n<p>From ancient times, the disbelievers have waged war against Islam, describing it in the worst of terms, in order to put people off it. “They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.” [at-Tawbah 9:32]. That includes their description of Islam as terrorism and savagery. They forget that terrorism, savagery, genocide, transgression against people unlawfully, and all other blameworthy attitudes in fact belong to the way of the disbelievers and are part of the disbelievers’ character.</p>\n<p>The fact that some so-called Muslims have behaved wrongly – either out of ignorance or bad intentions – cannot be attributed to Islam, for Islam forbids such deeds.</p>\n<p>The way to protect Islam from this accusation is to explain that the actions of these individuals has nothing to do with Islam; rather these are cases of individuals acting badly, and every Muslim is prone to error; no one is infallible except the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Fawzaan (1/416, question no. 247)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Can I do one wudu after another, seeking greater reward, because I heard that doing that is disliked (makrooh)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It is Sunnah to renew wudu even when one still has wudu, according to the majority of scholars, including the four imams. This is indicated by a number of hadiths, including the following:</p>\n<p>The report narrated by al-Bukhari (214) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do wudu for every prayer. At-Tirmidhi (58) added: whether he was in a state of purity or not.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our companions are agreed that it is recommended to renew wudu, which means when a person’s wudu is still valid and he does wudu again without having invalidated his wudu. End quote.</p>\n<p>See: <em>al-Majmoo‘</em> (1/495), <em>al-Mughni</em> (1/96) and <em>al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em> (10/155).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>When is it recommended to renew wudu? There are several scholarly views. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The most correct view in our madhhab is: If he prayed with the first wudu, whether the prayer was obligatory or supererogatory. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘</em>: Renewing wudu may be Sunnah, if the person prayed with the wudu he did previously. If he prayed with the wudu he did previously, then it is recommended for him to do wudu again for the next prayer.</p>\n<p>For example, someone did wudu for Zuhr and prayed Zuhr, then the time for ‘Asr came and he was still in a state of purity. In that case, it is Sunnah for him to do a new wudu, because he already prayed with the previous wudu. So renewing wudu for ‘Asr is something prescribed. If he did not pray with it, meaning that he did wudu for ‘Asr before the time for the prayer began, and did not pray with this wudu, then when the adhaan was given for ‘Asr he renewed this wudu, this is not prescribed, because he did not pray with the first wudu… End quote.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on the 40 days and 4 months to the different parts of the world to call Muslim brothers towards the duties of Islam?</p>\n",

Their efforts in calling people to Allah (da’wah) cannot be denied. But like many other groups they make some mistakes, and some points should be noted concerning them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistakes_of_Jama39at_al-Tablighnbsp\">Mistakes of Jama'at al-Tabligh&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>These points may be summed up as follows, noting that these mistakes may vary within this group, depending on the environment and society in which they find themselves. In societies in which knowledge and scholars are prevalent and the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah is widespread, the mistakes are much less; in other societies these mistakes may be greater. Some of their mistakes are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Not adopting the ‘aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah. This is clearly seen from the variations in the ‘aqidah of some of their members and even of some of their leaders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Their not paying attention to shar’i knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 – Their misinterpretation of some Quranic verses in a manner that was not intended by Allah. For example they interpret the verses on jihad as referring to “going out for da’wah”. The verses which mentioned the word khuruj (going out) etc. are interpreted by them as meaning going out for da’wah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 – They make their system of going out for da’wah an act of worship. So they started to misquote the Quran to support their system which specifies certain numbers of days and months. This system, which they think is based on evidence from Quran, is widespread among them in all countries and environments. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>5 – They do some things that go against shari’ah, such as appointing one of them to make du'a for them whilst the group goes out for da’wah, and they think that their success or failure depends on whether or not this man was sincere and his du'a accepted. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>6 – Da’if (weak) and mawdu’ (fabricated) ahadeeth are widespread among them, and this is not befitting for those who aim to call people to Allah. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 – They do not speak of munkarat (evil things), thinking that enjoining what is good is sufficient. Hence we find that they do not speak about evils that are widespread among the people, even though the slogan of this ummah – which they continually repeat – is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful” </strong>[Aal ‘Imran 3:104 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>The successful are those who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, not just those who do only one of the two.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8 – Some of them fall into self-admiration and arrogance, which leads them to look down on others, and even to look down on the scholars and describe them as inactive and sleeping, or to show off. So you find them talking about how they went out and travelled, and they saw such and such, which leads to unfavourable results, as we have mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9 – They regard going out for da’wah as better than many acts of worship such as jihad and seeking knowledge, even though those things are obligatory duties, or may be obligatory for some people but not others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10 – Some of them audaciously issue fatwas, and discuss tafsir and hadith. That is because they allow each one of them to address the people and explain to them. This leads to them speaking audaciously on matters of shari’ah. So they inevitably speak of the meaning of a ruling, hadith or verse when they have not read anything about it, or listened to any of the scholars. And some of them are new Muslims or have only recently come back to Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>11- Some of them are negligent with regard to the rights of their children and wives. We have discussed the seriousness of this matter in the answer to question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3043\" target=\"_blank\">3043</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence the scholars do not allow people to go out with them, except for those who want to help them and correct the mistakes that they have fallen into.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We should not keep the people away from them altogether, rather we must try to correct their mistakes and advise them so that their efforts will continue and they will be correct according to the Quran and Sunnah. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fatwas_on_Jama39at_al-Tabligh\">Fatwas on Jama'at al-Tabligh</span></h3>\n<p>There follow the fatwas of some of the scholars concerning <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/47431\" target=\"_blank\">Jama'at al-Tabligh</a> :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39349\" target=\"_blank\">Jama'at al-Tabligh</a> do not have proper understanding of the issues of ‘aqidah, so it is not permissible to go out with them, except for one who has knowledge and understanding of the correct ‘aqidah of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10777\" target=\"_blank\">Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah</a> , so that he can guide them and advise them, and cooperate with them in doing good, because they are very active, but they need more knowledge and someone who can guide them of those who have knowledge of Tawheed and the Sunnah. May Allah bless us all with proper understanding of Islam and make us steadfast in adhering to it.” *Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 8/331)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2 – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Going out for the sake of Allah does not refer to the kind of going out that they mean nowadays. Going out for the sake of Allah means going out to fight. What they call going out nowadays is a bid’ah (innovation) that was not narrated from the salaf.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Going out to call people to Allah cannot be limited to a certain number of days, rather one should call people to Allah according to one's abilities, without limiting that to a group or to forty days or more or less than that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly the da’iyah must have knowledge. It is not permissible for a person to call people to Allah when he is ignorant. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge” </strong>[Yusuf 12:108], i.e., with knowledge, because the caller must know that to which he calls people, what is obligatory, mustahabb, haram and makruh. He has to know what shirk, sin, kufr, immorality and disobedience are; he has to know the degrees of denouncing evil and how to do it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The kind of going out that distracts people from seeking knowledge is wrong, because seeking knowledge is an obligation, and it can only be achieved by learning, not by inspiration. This is one of the misguided Sufi myths, because action without knowledge is misguidance, and hoping to acquire knowledge without learning is an illusion.” (<em>Thalath Muhadarat fi’l-‘Ilm wa’l-Da’wah</em>)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "If a woman in ihram covers her face, does she have to keep the cloth away from her face?",
      "question": "<p>I heard that the piece of cloth with which a woman covers her face in ihram should not touch the nose; how correct is that?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>\tThe Muslim woman \tis required to cover her face in front of men who are non-mahrams to her. If \tshe is in ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, she should cover her face with something \tother than the niqab, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \tupon him) forbade the woman in ihram to wear niqab.</p>\n<p>\tThis has been \texplained, with evidence, in fatwa no. <a href=\"/en/answers/172289\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">172289</a></p>\n<p>\tIf the woman in \tihram covers her face with her head cover, jilbaab and the like, then she \tdoes not have to create a distance between the cover and her face, because \tthere is no report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \thim) to indicate that this is required. Rather the actions of women at the \ttime of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicate that \tthis is not required.</p>\n<p>\t‘Aa’ishah (may \tAllah be pleased with her) said: The riders used to pass us when we were \twith the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in \tihram. When they drew close to us, one of us would let down her jilbaab from \ther head over her face, and when they had passed us we would uncover it \tagain.</p>\n<p>\tIt is well-known \tthat the jilbaab that is let down from the head over the face will \tinevitably touch the face.</p>\n<p>\tShaykh al-Islam \tIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa \t(26/112-113):</p>\n<p>\tIf a woman \tcovers her face with something that does not touch the face, that is \tpermissible according to consensus.</p>\n<p>\tIf it does touch \tthe face, then the correct view is that it is also permissible, and a woman \tis not required to go to the trouble of creating a distance between her \tcover and her face, whether that is with a stick or her hand or anything \telse. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) treated the \twoman’s face and hands equally (in terms of covering) and both of them are \tlike the body of a man, not like his head. The wives of the Prophet \t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to let down (their head \tcovers or jilbaabs) over their faces without paying attention to creating a \tdistance. End quote.</p>\n<p>\tThe difference \tbetween a man’s body and his head in the case of ihram is that a man is \tprohibited from covering his head with anything that clings to the head, \twhether that thing is something ordinary or otherwise. As for his body, he \tis not forbidden to cover it; rather he is only forbidden to wear clothing \tthat is tailored to fit the body. </p>\n<p>\tIbn al-Qayyim \t(may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tThe Mother of \tthe Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the \triders passed by us, one of us would let down her jilbaab from her head over \ther face. And she did not use a stick to create some distance between her \tface and the jilbaab, as some of the fuqaha’ suggest. This is not known from \tany of the women of the Sahaabah or from the Mothers of the Believers at \tall, either as an action that they did or something that was enjoined in a \tfatwa. It is impossible that this could have been one of the practices of \tihram and was not well known among them and known to everyone, elite and \tcommon folk alike.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from\tBadaa’i‘ al-Fawaa’id (2/664-665)</p>\n<p>\tShaykh ‘Abd \tal-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tIt is \tpermissible for the woman in ihram to let her head cover down over her face \tif she needs to do so, without using anything to lift it off her face. If \tthe head cover touches her face, there is no blame on her, because of the \thadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The riders \tused to pass us … and he quoted the hadith mentioned above.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from\tMajmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (16/54-55)</p>\n<p>\tHe also said \t(16/56):</p>\n<p>\tWith regard to \twhat many women do, of using a stick under the head cover to lift it off the \tface, there is no basis for that in sharee‘ah as far as we know. If that \twere prescribed, the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \twould have explained it to his ummah, and he could not have remained silent \tabout it. End quote.</p>\n<p>\tShaykh Muhammad \tibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>\tThere is no \tblame on the woman if her hijab touches her face, contrary to the view of \tsome scholars who say that the hijab must not touch her face, because there \tis no evidence for this condition in the Qur’an or Sunnah.</p>\n<p>\tEnd quote from\tMajmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (22/184)</p>\n<p>\tAnd Allah knows \tbest.    </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Qur’aan: ‘Recite and rise in status as you used to recite in the world, and your position will be at the last verse you recite.’” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1646; al-Tirmidhi, 2914; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.<br />\nDoes this mean if im a non-arab and can not arabic so i did never recite Quran does this mean that i will be in the lowest level of jannah ?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (2914) and Abu Dawood (1464) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Qur’an: ‘Read, and ascend, and recite as you used to recite in the [previous] world, for your status will be according to the last verse that you recite.’”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-‘Azeemabaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It will be said”: i.e., when people are admitted to Paradise</p>\n<p>“to the companion of the Qur’an” i.e., the one who consistently recites it and acts upon it, not the one who reads it and does not act upon it.</p>\n<p>“Read and ascend” i.e., to the higher levels of Paradise or of closeness to Allah.</p>\n<p>“”and recite” i.e., do not be hasty in your recitation in Paradise</p>\n<p>“as you used to recite” that is, in your reading</p>\n<p>“in the [previous] world”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From this hadeeth it may be understood that this greater reward will not be attained except by one who memorized the Qur’an and learned how to recite it properly and in a precise manner, as it should be done.</p>\n<p>End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma‘bood fi Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood (4/237).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/169485\">169485</a> we discussed what is meant by the virtue mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above; it is only attained by the one who memorises the Qur’an and acts upon it; please see the question mentioned for more information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth mentioned above speaks about the virtue of the companion of the Qur’an. That does not mean that the one who has not memorized the Qur’an will be of the lowest status in Paradise. Rather the hadeeth refers to a particular virtue for a particular deed; it does not indicate that the higher levels (of Paradise) will only be attained by those who memorise or read the Qur’an. Most of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not memorise the Book of Allah, in the sense of memorising its recitation; rather they memorised it in the sense of acting upon it. So if anyone misses out on this particular reward and virtue, it is still possible for him to strive hard in whatever virtues Allah makes easy for him, such as prayer, tahajjud and qiyaam (voluntary prayers during the night); or zakaah and charity; or fasting on hot days; or constantly remembering Allah; or meeting people’s needs… Or whatever else Allah wills of different kinds of goodness and guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (3256) and Muslim (2831) narrated from Abu Sa ‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will see the people of the highest place in Paradise above them as you see the brilliant star far away on the horizon in the east or the west, because of the difference in status between them.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, is that the status of the Prophets that no one else will attain? He said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul. They are men who believed in Allah and believed in the Messengers.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (251) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises people in status?” They said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Doing wudoo’ properly at times when it is difficult to do so, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for prayer after prayer. That is constant readiness.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27075\">27075</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

It was narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abi Bakrah, from his father, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) granted a concession to travellers: if a traveller did wudu and put on khuffs, then he invalidated his wudu, he could wipe over the khuffs for three days and nights; the non-traveller could do so for one day and one night.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Ibn Majah (556) and others.
