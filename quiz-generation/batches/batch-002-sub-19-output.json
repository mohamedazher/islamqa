      "question": "A woman gave birth and experienced intermittent bleeding with yellowish discharge. Ten days after childbirth, she begins fasting in Ramadan while still experiencing light bleeding and mucus without complete dryness. What is the ruling on her fasts?",
      "options": [
        "Her fasts are invalid because yellowish discharge or mucus without complete dryness still counts as nifaas",
        "Her fasts are valid since nifaas has a maximum limit of ten days and she has passed that period",
        "Her fasts are valid if the bleeding is very light, even without seeing complete dryness or white discharge",
        "Her fasts are valid after seeing the white discharge, even if yellowish mucus continues afterward"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "According to Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen, yellowish discharge or mucus without clear signs of purity (complete dryness or white discharge) still comes under the same rulings as nifaas blood. The woman is not pure until this ends completely. The maximum limit of nifaas is forty days, not ten, and fasting is not valid while in nifaas."

      "question": "A charitable foundation holds Quran memorization competitions and wants to give cash prizes from zakah funds to the winners. What is the Islamic ruling on this practice?",
      "options": [
        "Prizes can be given from zakah funds only if the winner is among the eight categories entitled to receive zakah",
        "Zakah prizes are permissible for all Muslims who win Quran competitions regardless of their financial status",
        "Zakah funds can be used for such prizes because they encourage memorization of Quran and Islamic knowledge",
        "Non-Muslim winners can receive zakah prizes if they show genuine interest in learning about Islam"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Zakah can only be spent on the eight categories mentioned in Quran 9:60. Shaykh Ibn Jibreen stated that zakah may be given to poor Muslims even if given as prizes, but if the winner is not one of those entitled to zakah, it is not permissible. These competitions should be financed through donations and waqfs, not zakah."

      "question": "What was the belief of pre-Islamic Arabs regarding Allah and their idol worship before Prophet Muhammad was sent?",
      "options": [
        "They acknowledged Allah as the Creator and Provider but worshipped idols as intermediaries to bring them closer to Allah",
        "They were completely unaware of the concept of Allah until Prophet Muhammad introduced monotheism to them",
        "They believed the idols themselves were the actual creators and providers who controlled the universe",
        "They worshipped Allah alone without any partners but rejected the concept of prophethood and messengers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Quran confirms in verses 31:25 and 39:38 that pre-Islamic Arabs acknowledged Allah as the Creator of heavens and earth. Their problem was shirk in worship (uloohiyyah), not denying Allah's existence. They worshipped idols not as creators, but as intermediaries, saying 'We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah' (39:3)."

      "question": "A family's sacrificial animal fell from the roof on the day of Eid after the prayer. They managed to slaughter it properly before it died. What is the ruling on this sacrifice?",
      "options": [
        "The sacrifice is valid if slaughtered at the proper time before the animal died, even though it was damaged from the fall",
        "The sacrifice is invalid because the animal was damaged by falling, making it unsuitable as an udhiyah",
        "A new sacrifice must be offered because the animal died from a headlong fall which is forbidden",
        "The sacrifice is only valid if it was slaughtered before any injury or damage occurred to the animal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The answer clarifies that if the animal was slaughtered during the days of sacrifice (Eid day and three following days) and they managed to slaughter it before it died, it is valid. Quran 5:3 forbids animals killed by headlong fall 'unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death),' which means catching it and slaughtering properly while there is still life in it."

      "question": "A group of friends joked about punishments in Hell months ago. They have since performed Umrah and continue their regular prayers, unaware that such jokes constitute disbelief. What must they do?",
      "options": [
        "They must renew their faith by uttering the Shahadatayn and repent specifically from the apostasy of mocking Islam",
        "Their Umrah and subsequent prayers automatically renewed their faith, so no specific action is needed now",
        "Only the person who initiated the joke needs to repent; those who merely laughed are not affected",
        "They should continue their worship sincerely and Allah will forgive them without explicitly renewing the Shahadah"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "According to Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymin, whoever speaks words of disbelief even in jest has disbelieved and must repent, believing they are repenting from apostasy. While uttering the Shahadah during Umrah or prayer is sufficient for renewal, they must repent sincerely and specifically from this grave evil. Quran 9:65-66 explicitly states that mocking Allah's revelations constitutes disbelief."

      "question": "A Muslim man committed zina with a married woman who had left her abusive husband. The woman has now received her divorce papers and completed her iddah. Both have repented. Can they marry?",
      "options": [
        "Marriage is valid if he did not turn her against her husband and they both sincerely repented from the zina",
        "The marriage is automatically invalid because zina occurred with a married woman, regardless of subsequent repentance",
        "They can marry immediately after her divorce without waiting for iddah since zina already occurred between them",
        "Separation from her husband for one year constituted automatic divorce, so the zina was with an unmarried woman"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The answer states that if the man did not turn the woman against her husband (which would invalidate marriage per Ibn Taymiyyah and Malikis), and only met her after she had already left, the marriage is valid after sincere repentance. Most scholars allow marriage of zaani to zaaniyah after repentance. Separation alone does not cause divorce; actual divorce must occur, and iddah must be completed."

      "question": "What are the conditions required for the Shahadah (La ilaha ill-Allah) to be accepted and lead to Paradise?",
      "options": [
        "Knowledge of its meaning, certainty without doubt, acceptance with the heart, submission to its implications, truthfulness, sincerity, and love for Allah",
        "Reciting it five times daily during prayers, teaching it to family members, and sharing it with the Muslim community",
        "Memorizing all ninety-nine names of Allah, performing all five daily prayers punctually, and making regular supplications",
        "Believing in Allah's existence, avoiding all major sins consistently, and attending Friday congregational prayers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The scholars identified seven main conditions: (1) Knowledge of the Shahadah's meaning, (2) Certainty as opposed to doubt, (3) Acceptance with heart and words, (4) Submission to what it implies, (5) Truthfulness from the heart, (6) Sincerity free from shirk, and (7) Love for this word and its people. Some scholars add an eighth: rejection of false gods (al-kufr bi'l-taghut)."

      "question": "What is the ruling on organizing and attending festivals that feature singers, music, actors and poets for most of the event?",
      "options": [
        "It is haraam to organize or attend such festivals as they waste wealth in sinful activities and spread immorality among believers",
        "Such festivals are permissible if they include some Islamic poetry and Quranic recitation alongside the music and singing",
        "Attending is permissible as long as one maintains good intention and does not personally participate in singing or dancing",
        "Organizing is allowed if the performers are Muslim and the songs contain no explicitly haraam or immoral content"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The answer states it is haraam to organize parties with haraam elements like singing and music, as they are causes of falling into immorality. Quran 24:19 warns about spreading immorality among believers. It is also haraam to attend as this wastes time and money in things not pleasing to Allah and constitutes cooperating in sin, which contradicts Quran 5:2."

      "question": "During Tarawih prayers with lengthy recitation, a worshipper sits between sets to rest. Can he say the opening takbir while sitting, then stand up during the recitation when he feels energetic?",
      "options": [
        "He can say the opening takbir while sitting and stand when energetic, but will receive half the reward of praying standing throughout",
        "He must say the opening takbir while standing or the entire rak'ah will be invalid",
        "Sitting during any part of Tarawih prayer invalidates that rak'ah and it must be repeated",
        "The reward is the same whether sitting or standing since Tarawih is a voluntary prayer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "It is permissible to sit in nafl prayers with no excuse according to scholarly consensus, but the reward is half that of praying standing (as stated in hadith in Muslim 1214). One may say the opening takbir sitting then stand later in the same rak'ah, as the Prophet would recite sitting when tired, then stand to bow. This applies when able to stand; if unable, the full reward is maintained."

      "question": "A person joined the prayer late. The imam made a mistake after the latecomer joined and performed the prostration of forgetfulness before the salaam. What should the latecomer do?",
      "options": [
        "He must follow the imam in prostration, then prostrate again after completing his own missed rak'ahs and giving salaam",
        "He should not repeat the prostration of forgetfulness since following the imam once in prostration is sufficient",
        "He should wait and prostrate with the imam after the salaam if the mistake happened while he was in the prayer",
        "He only needs to prostrate if the imam's mistake occurred specifically in the rak'ah that he joined"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "When the imam prostrates before salaam for a mistake that occurred after the latecomer joined, the latecomer must follow him because he is connected to his imam. However, he must prostrate again after completing his prayer, because his first prostration with the imam was not at the right point in his own prayer (it was only done in following the imam). If the mistake occurred before he joined, he doesn't repeat it."
