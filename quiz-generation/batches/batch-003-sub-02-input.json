      "title": "Referring for judgement to courts of man-made law in cases of necessity",
      "question": "<p>Is referring for judgement to man-made laws or working in that field haraam?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Referring for judgement to courts of man-made law which is contrary to sharee’ah is not permissible; the same applies to working in them and applying those laws among people, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And so judge (you O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) among them by what Allaah has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you. And if they turn away, then know that Allaah’s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And truly, most of men are Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah).</p>\n<p>50.&nbsp;Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:49-50]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.</p>\n<p>60.&nbsp;Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot (false judges) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shaytaan (Satan) wishes to lead them far astray.</p>\n<p>61.&nbsp;And when it is said to them: “Come to what Allaah has sent down and to the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم),” you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) see the hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with aversion”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4: 59 -61]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:65]</p>\n<p>And there are other verses which enjoin referring for judgement to that which Allaah has revealed and forbid referring for judgement to anything that goes against it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if a person is forced to refer for judgement to man-made laws, in order to ward off wrongdoing or get back his rights, it is permissible for him to do that subject to certain conditions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.That he cannot get his rights except by this way.</p>\n<p>2.That he should do it reluctantly and hate this way of referring for judgement.</p>\n<p>3.That he should not take more than his due, even if the law gives it to him.</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: What is the ruling on referring for judgement to American law in a dispute between Muslims, with regard to cases of divorce, commerce and other matters?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: It is not permissible for a Muslim to refer for judgement to man-made laws except in cases of necessity if there are no sharee’ah courts. If he is awarded something that is not his right, it is not permissible for him to take it. End quote.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/502&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on the work of a Muslim who studies man-made law, then opens a law office and represents cases in civil courts on behalf of companies? What is the ruling on the money that he accumulates?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: Putting man-made laws that are contrary to sharee’ah in the place of sharee’ah is kufr, because it is removing sharee’ah and putting taghoot (falsehood) in its place, and this is included in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to a person learning man-made law, if he is learning it in order to ward off falsehood with truth, there is nothing wrong with that. But if he is learning it in order to follow what is contains of laws contrary to sharee’ah, this is haraam. Concerning that we say: even with regard to the lawyer in a country that is governed by sharee’ah, we say that if the lawyer wants to bring people's rights to them, there is nothing wrong with practising this profession, but if he wants to prove the other party wrong, whether it is true or false, this is haraam.

      "title": "Will children be rewarded for their good deeds?",
      "question": "<p>I know that a person is not accounted for his sins before the age of puberty, what about his good deeds, does he get rewarded for them?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Yes, children will be rewarded for doing good deeds, because of the hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1335) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: “A woman lifted up a child and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, will his Hajj (pilgrimage) be counted?’ He said, ‘Yes, and you will be rewarded.’” The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel fi Sharh Mukhtasar Shaykh al-Khaleel said, regarding the matter of children being instructed to pray when they reach the age of seven: “Al-Qaraafi said in al-Yawaaqeet fi’l-Mawaaqeet: children will earn reward for good deeds that they do because of the hadeeth (prophetic narration) of the Khath’ami woman [who lifted up her child and asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about his Hajj].”</p>\n<p>Ibn Rushd said: “The bad deeds of young children are not recorded but their good deeds will be recorded, according to the sound opinion.”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed, commenting on the first hadeeth quoted therein, which is the hadeeth of the Khath’ami woman: “… Abu’l-‘Aaliyah al-Riyaahi said: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: the young child’s good deeds will be recorded but his bad deeds will not be recorded.”</p>\n<p>The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel said, concerning children entering ihraam (sacred state) for Hajj and ‘Umrah:</p>\n<p>“The scholars do not differ concerning the fact that children will be rewarded for whatever acts of obedience (to Allaah) they do, and will be let off for any bad deeds that they do, and any bad deeds they do deliberately will be counted as mistakes. It says in Mukhtasar al-Waadihah: ‘Hajj is not an obligation for boys and girls until boys reach puberty and girls begin menstruating, but there is nothing wrong with taking them for Hajj. It is recommended (mustahabb), and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did so.’”</p>\n<p>Then he reported that Talhah ibn Musarrif said: “It was one of the customs of the Muslims to take their children for Hajj and expose them to the mercy of Allaah.”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed that it is encouraged to take children for Hajj, and that the majority of scholars say this. He also said: “It is nothing strange that a child should earn reward and status in the Hereafter for his salaah (prayers), zakaah (paying poor-due), Hajj and other good deeds if he does them as they should be done, (because this is) grace and mercy from Allaah, just as Allaah shows mercy to the dead by rewarding them for acts of charity done on their behalf by the living. Do you not see that they (the scholars) are agreed that a child should be commanded to pray when he reaches the age of understanding and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led Anas and the orphan in prayer? Most of the salaf (pious predecessors) said that zakaah has to be paid on the property of orphans, and it is impossible that they would not be rewarded for that. Their guardians and the one who does this on their behalf will also certainly be rewarded, as will the one who takes them for Hajj, as a blessing and mercy from Allaah. It was reported that ‘Umar said: ‘Children’s good deeds will be recorded and their bad deeds will not be recorded.’ I do not know of anyone whose opinion is worth following who said anything to the contrary.”</p>\n<p>According to al-Ikmaal, many of the scholars said: “Children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience (to Allaah), and their good deeds will be recorded, but not their bad deeds.”</p>\n<p>It says in Awaa’il al-Muqaddimaat: “The correct opinion in my view is that they are both encouraged to do that and will both be rewarded for it (i.e., the child and his or her guardian). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the woman [who asked about the child’s Hajj]: ‘… and you will be rewarded.’ And Allaah knows best.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Jamaa’ah said: “According to the four (imams/leading scholars), children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience and their good deeds will be recorded, whether they are mature or not. This was reported from ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him. Some scholars report that there was consensus (ijmaa’) in this matter. It is also indicated by what we have already said under the heading of Virtues (fadaa’il), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The jihaad (physival battle) of the very old and the very young is Hajj and ‘Umrah,’ as well as the hadeeth about the woman who lifted up a child.”</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Islamic Ruling on Fasting during Pregnancy",
      "question": "<p>Is it mandatory for a pregnant woman to observe fasting in Ramadan and Ashura. I advised my wife not to fast during last Ramadan and she was not fasting because she was pregnant. She was weak and anemic last time when she was pregnant. She had miscarried by the end of Ramadan when she was 12 weeks pregnant. What is the ruling about her missed fasting during Ramadan? Does she have to complete them before next Ramadan? Can she fast normally when she finds that she is pregnant? She always insists on fasting during pregnancy. Any medical evidences will also help that the baby won't be harmed by fasting during pregnancy.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Fasting_during_pregnancy_Obligatory\">Fasting during pregnancy: Obligatory?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#How_a_miscarriage_in_Ramadan_affects_a_womanrsquos_fast\">How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Ruling_on_making_up_missed_fasts_by_a_pregnant_woman\">Ruling on making up missed fasts by a pregnant woman</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>This question covers three topics:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-The ruling on a pregnant woman breaking her fast in Ramadan</p>\n<p>2-How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast</p>\n<p>3-The ruling on making up fasts after Ramadan</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fasting_during_pregnancy_Obligatory\">Fasting during pregnancy: Obligatory?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3434\" target=\"_blank\">It is permissible for a pregnant woman not to fast</a> if she fears some harm which she thinks will most likely affect her and/or her baby. Breaking the fast becomes obligatory if she fears that she may die or be severely harmed if she fasts. In that case, she has to make up the fast later on but she does not have to pay the fidyah. This is according to the consensus of the fuqaha, because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And do not kill yourselves.” [al-Nisa 4:29]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and do not throw yourselves into destruction.” [al-Baqarah 2:195]</p>\n<p>The scholars are similarly agreed that it is not obligatory to pay the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49944\" target=\"_blank\">fidyah</a> in this case, because a woman in this case is like one who is sick and one who fears for his life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the woman fears for her baby only (and not for herself), then some of the scholars are of the view that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/37719\" target=\"_blank\">it is permissible for her to break her fast</a> , but they say that she must make up the fast later on and pay the fidyah (which means feeding one poor person for each day not fasted), because of the report narrated from Ibn 'Abbas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184]</p>\n<p>Ibn 'Abbas said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This is a concession allowed to old men and women, who can only fast with difficulty; they are allowed to break the fast and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/93243\" target=\"_blank\">to feed one poor person for each day of fasting missed</a> . This also applies to pregnant and nursing women, if they are afraid.” Abu Dawud said: “i.e., if they are afraid for their children, they may break the fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1947; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 4/18, 25) (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 16/272)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence it is clear that if fasting will cause great harm to a woman or to her baby, she is obliged to break the fast, on condition that the doctor who states that fasting will cause harm is a doctor who can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This has to do with breaking the fast during Ramadan. With regard to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/303756\" target=\"_blank\">‘Ashura</a> , fasting on this day is not obligatory, according to scholarly consensus; rather it is mustahabb, and it is not permissible for a woman to observe a nafl fast when her husband is present, except with his permission. If he tells her not to fast then she has to obey him, especially if that is in the interests of the fetus.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_a_miscarriage_in_Ramadan_affects_a_womanrsquos_fast\">How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to miscarriage: “If the matter is as mentioned, that the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/95762\" target=\"_blank\">miscarriage occurred in the third month of pregnancy</a> , then the blood that comes out is not considered to be the blood of nifas (bleeding following childbirth), rather it is the blood of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/68810\" target=\"_blank\">istihadah</a> (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), because what the woman passed was a clot (‘alaqah) in which there were no human features. On this basis, she should pray and fast even if she sees some blood, but she should do wudu for each prayer, and she has to make up the days when she did not fast and the prayers that she missed.” (See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10.218)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ruling_on_making_up_missed_fasts_by_a_pregnant_woman\">Ruling on making up missed fasts by a pregnant woman</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the fasts that a pregnant woman has missed: “Everyone who owes fasts from Ramadan has to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/65875\" target=\"_blank\">make them up before the next Ramadan</a> . They may delay that until Sha’ban. But if the next Ramadan comes and he has not made them up and had no excuse for that, then he is guilty of sin and he has to make them up as well as feeding one poor person for each day, as was stated by a number of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The amount to be given is half a sa’ of the local staple food for each day, which may be given to a number of poor persons or to one. But if a person had an excuse for delaying making up the fasts, because he was sick or was traveling, then all he has to do is to make up the missed fasts, and he does not have to feed the poor, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>‘but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.’ [al-Baqarah 2:184].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And Allah is the Source of strength.” &nbsp;(Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/340)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He wants to do ‘umrah on behalf of someone who has been missing for four years, and he is asking about the ruling on doing ‘umrah on his behalf; will the one who does ‘umrah or Hajj on his behalf be rewarded?",
      "question": "<p>My question has to do with ‘umrah in Ramadan, as I am going to do ‘umrah soon, and I hope that you can answer my question. The father of a friend of mine in Syria, in Damascus, disappeared four years ago, and we have had no news of him. We have spent the last four years looking for him and asking about him, with no success until now, no trace of him and no news. My questions are: 1. Can we assume that my friend’s father has died? What are the rulings once it is assumed that someone who has disappeared is dead? 2. Is it permissible for me to do ‘umrah on his behalf? 3. Will we both receive the reward of ‘umrah in Ramadan, which is equivalent to Hajj, in sha Allah? Or is it only me that will attain this reward?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If someone is lost and disappears to the extent that it is not known whether he is alive or dead, then he may be deemed to have died after the passage of a certain length of time, when it becomes most likely that if he were still alive, you would have heard news of him by now.</p>\n<p>The most correct view regarding the definition of this period is that reference should be made to the qaadi (shar‘i judge). The qaadi is the one who should define what that time period is, because the circumstances of those who go missing and the causes that led to their disappearance vary greatly. &nbsp;So the case of each missing person should be examined by the qaadi in order to determine the most appropriate period in light of the incident that led to his disappearance.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/226048\" target=\"_blank\">226048</a> .</p>\n<p>In the case of this man who is missing in Syria, if he went out of his house as normal and did not return for four years, then in this case it is most likely that his absence is due to his having died.</p>\n<p>But because of the complicated circumstances and situation of people in Syria, and because of the seriousness of the rulings that result from deeming him to have died, no one should determine that he has died except the qaadi.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, regarding the issue of one who is missing:</p>\n<p>It is essential to have the ruling of a qaadi, to avoid causing chaos among people, because if we say that every woman whose husband has gone missing should wait for a certain length of time until she thinks it most likely that he has died, then she may remarry, that would lead to chaos.</p>\n<p>It is essential to consult the qaadi, for he is the one who should handle this matter, and this is a must.\" (A<em>sh-Sharh al-Mumti‘</em>&nbsp; 13/374).</p>\n<p>If there is a qaadi (shar‘i judge) in your area, then he should be consulted to rule concerning this matter.</p>\n<p>If there is no qaadi or it is not possible to contact him, then the scholars in your area should act in the stead of the qaadi, because it is a matter of necessity. So one of the trustworthy scholars may rule concerning that, who is qualified to issue fatwas concerning such matters, and his ruling will be binding, like the ruling of the judge.</p>\n<p>Ad-Dasooqi al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Note regarding some issues connected to the missing person: his marriage may be annulled because of his not spending on his wife’s maintenance or because his wife is harmed because of the empty bed. But his marriage can only be annulled by a qaadi, unless it is difficult to find a qaadi either in a real sense are in a metaphorical sense, such as if the qaadi insists on charging to annul the marriage, in which case a group of Muslims may act in his stead, as was mentioned by our shaykh al-‘Adawi.\" (<em>Haashiyat ad-Daasooqi</em>&nbsp; 3/302).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>With regard to the rulings that result from the determination that the missing person has died, there are many rulings, the most important of which are:</p>\n<p>His wealth should be divided among his heirs if the qaadi rules that he has died.</p>\n<p>His wife should observe the ‘iddah of one whose husband has died, from the time it is determined that he has died. After her ‘iddah ends, she may remarry if she wishes.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/214999\" target=\"_blank\">214999</a> .</p>\n<p>With regard to doing ‘umrah on behalf of this missing person, there is nothing wrong with doing ‘umrah on his behalf, even if the judge has not determined that he has died, because doing an act of worship on behalf of someone else, or dedicating the reward of that to him, is not a transgression against any of the rights of the missing person, or any of his relatives, so it is not taking away someone’s rights or neglecting someone’s rights, and it is not a matter to be strict about. The matter is broad in scope, praise be to Allah.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/228060\" target=\"_blank\">228060</a> .</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If someone does ‘umrah or Hajj on behalf of someone who is deceased or incapacitated, will he have a similar reward, or is the reward only for the one on whose behalf it was done?</p>\n<p>There are two scholarly views concerning this matter, as the texts concerning it are not clear.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, undoubtedly the one who does that on behalf of someone else will be rewarded for showing kindness to his brother by doing the rituals on his behalf, and he will be rewarded for whatever he does of acts of worship that are separate from the actions of Hajj, that he does in the Haram, such as prayer, dhikr, du‘aa’, and so on.</p>\n<p>With regard to any reward in addition to the reward for that, that is subject to Allah’s will, and Allah’s bounty and kindness are immense.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/174707\" target=\"_blank\">174707</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Reciting du`a in Qunut al-Witr is permissible for the imam and the one who is praying alone, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (1425) and Ibn Maajah (1178) from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me some words to say in qunoot al-witr: “Allahumma’hdinee fiman hadayta wa ‘aafinee fiman ‘aafayta wa tawallanee fiman tawallayta wa baarik lee fimaa a’tayta wa qinee sharra maa qadayt, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa ‘alayk.

Protect me from the evil You have decreed for verily You decree and none can decree over You. For surety, he whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take an enemy is never honored and mighty. O our Lord, Blessed and Exalted are You. There is no refuge from You except with You).”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i. See also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/14093\">14093</a>.</p>\n<p>It is not proven that Qunut al-Witr is something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, rather it is proven that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did it, as was narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Bayhaqi.</p>\n<p>Hence some of the scholars are of the view that it is better not to recite al-Qunut all the time, rather one should do it sometimes and not at other times. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) (4/19).</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that one should not recite Qunut except in the second half of Ramadaan. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i and of Maalik in one report.</p>\n<p>Al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Qunut should not be recited in Ramadaan except in the second half (of the month). This is what Ibn ‘Umar and Mu’aadh al-Qaari used to do. End quote from Mukhtasar al-Muzani, published with al-Umm (8/114).</p>\n<p>Al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa (1/210): Two reports were narrated from Maalik concerning that, one of which says that Qunut should not be recited in Witr at all, and the other says that it is mustahabb during the second half of Ramadaan, This was reported by Ibn Habeeb from Maalik, and this was also the view of al-Shaafa’i.</p>\n<p>Abu Haneefah and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them) were of the view that Qunut should be recited throughout Ramadaan, and Qunut may be recited in Witr throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Qunut is Sunnah in Witr, in the single rak’ah, throughout the year. This is what is narrated by our companions and this is the view of Ibn Mas’ood, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and ashaab al-ra’i. It was also narrated from al-Hasan.</p>\n<p>Another opinion was narrated from Ahmad, which is that Qunut should not be recited except during the second half of Ramadaan. That was also narrated from ‘Ali and Ubayy, and it was the view of Ibn Sireen, Sa’eed ibn Abi’l-Hasan, al-Zuhri, Yahya ibn Wathaab, Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and it was the view favoured by Abu Bakr al-Athram, because of the report narrated from al-Hasan, that ‘Umar united the people behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b, and he used to lead them in prayer for twenty nights during which he only recited Qunut in the second half. Narrated by Abu Dawood. This is like consensus.</p>\n<p>Qataadah said: Qunut should be recited throughout the year except in the first half of Ramadaan, because of this report. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that he only recited Qunut in the second half of Ramadaan.</p>\n<p>And it was narrated that he did not recite Qunut in prayer at all.</p>\n<p>The first report is the one that is favoured by most of our companions. Ahmad said, according to the report of al-Marwadhi: I was of the view that it should be done in the second half of Ramadaan, but now I recite Qunut, because it is du`a and is good,and because of the report narrated from Ubayy, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Witr, and recite Qunut before bowing. It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say at the end of his Witr: “Allahumma innee a’oodhu bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika, wa a’oodhu bika minka. La uhsee thanaa’an ‘alayka, anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsik (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your protection from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from You. I cannot praise You enough, and You are as You have praised Yourself.”&nbsp; He did that all the time, and Ubayy’s action indicates that he saw him. The difference of opinion among the Sahaabah concerning this is not to be criticized, because it is Witr, in which Qunut is prescribed, like the latter half, and because it is dhikr that is prescribed in Witr, so it is prescribed throughout the year like any other dhikr. End quote from al-Mughni (1/447).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>One should not make the du`a of Qunut too lengthy, rather al-Baghawi said: It is makrooh to make Qunut lengthy, just as it is makrooh to make the first tashahhud lengthy. [Quoted by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo’, 3/479]. Al-Qaadi Husayn said: If Qunut is made lengthier than usual, that is makrooh, and may be invalid. [Quoted by al-Khateeb al-Sharbayni in Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 1/167].</p>\n<p>One should also avoid that which has been introduced by some imams who turn it into an exhortation by mentioning the grave, the resurrection, the reckoning and so on, which is more suited to sermons and exhortations than du`a and Qunut. If it is limited to the du`a that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to al-Hasan, or adds a little to that, this is better. It is a short du`a that you should learn by heart, so there is no need to look at a piece of paper.</p>\n<p>If you add some other short du`as that were taught by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this will be good, and it is easy to do.</p>\n<p>But if the imam or the worshipper is not able to memorize the du`as that are to be recited in Witr, there is nothing wrong with him choosing whatever du`as he wishes, because there is no specific du`a to be recited in Qunut, and al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad narrated that the scholars were unanimously agreed on that. [See: al-Majmoo’ 3/477].</p>\n<p>Now that we understand that the basic principle concerning the du`a of Qunut is that it is a short du`a, and that making it lengthy is makrooh and contrary to the Sunnah, and that there is no specific du`a to be recited, not even the du`a that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then there is no need to write the du`a on a piece of paper and read it whilst praying. Rather it seems that the motive for doing that is the desire on the part of imams or worshippers to&nbsp; recite complicated du`as and to make Qunut lengthy, as is the case with many imams nowadays.</p>\n<p>What the worshipper should do is be keen to ponder and focus, because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3479) from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Call upon Allah and be certain of a response, and understand that Allah does not answer a du`a from a heedless heart.” This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>There is no sin on a fasting person if he uses toothpaste, but he should be careful to avoid swallowing any of it.</p>\n<p>See also question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13619\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13619</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>A very personal and difficult to explain<br />\n      question:<br />\nI have a boy-friend who is originally from XXX,<br />\n   so he is a muslim. He now lives in the XXX and I live in<br />XXX. I am a christian.<br />He has asked me to marry him and I have agreed.<br /> The problem is .... his family. <br />They have arranged a future wife for him, but he does notwish to marry<br />\n      her. But out of respect for his father he will anyway, unles I become a muslim.<br />Then he HOPES his father will agree to our marriage.<br />Once I knew this, I asked him, what his family would do if they found out<br />\n      he intends to marry a European girl.<br />He could not really answer that question. <br />Now my question is: Do you have any idea how the family might react, and<br />\n      is it likely that the father would agree if I am a muslim?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is difficult to say what their reaction will be. Most parents want    their children to marry in accordance with their wishes, and in most cases they will have    chosen a wife for their son from their own country, whose customs and tradition are closer    to those of the society in which they live. The idea of their son marrying a western woman    may be very strange for them and difficult to accept, especially if they have heard about    the widespread promiscuity in the West and the freedom with which Western women enter into    relationships. They may also want their son to be near them, and they may be afraid that    if he marries someone overseas they will only see him rarely. They may warn him about the    consequences of raising his future children in a non-Islamic environment. On the other    hand, they might agree if they hear that their son is going to marry a decent, upright    Muslim girl, especially if their son is going to stay on and work in the West after    completing his studies, and if they give any weight to their son’s own wishes –    which is a matter that differs from family to family.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, you will not lose anything by entering Islam, whether    you marry this man or not. If you become Muslim and marry this man, after you both repent    from the forbidden relationship, then you will have got what you wanted. If this marriage    is not destined for you, then maybe Allaah will send you another good, clean Muslim man    whom you can marry and be happy with. The most important thing here is that you understand    that striving to please Allaah by following His religion is more important than all other    considerations. In any case, we hope that you will become Muslim and that your hopes will    be realized in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Thank you for your trust and your    question.</p>\n",

      "title": "A Christian woman is close to becoming Muslim and is married to a (Muslim) man who does not pray. What is the ruling on her marriage?",
      "question": "<p>There is a Christian woman who lives in Canada and is married to a Muslim man. She wanted to find out about Islam, and she has learned a lot at close hand and wanted to embrace it some day, but she was frustrated because she sees that her husband is careless about prayer, and the matter is so bad that he stopped praying a few months ago, until now. After he lost his job, he started to stay at home and his wife is the one who works and spends on household expenses. He just sits at the computer, talks to women and watches permissive movies on the net. To make matters worse, the wife found out about that by means of spy programs. <br />\n<br />\nWhat advice can you offer them? Please note that scholars differ as to whether the one who does not pray is a kaafir. I hope that you can explain this issue to us according to both views. May Allaah bless you. And I hope that you could send us the answer in both Arabic and English. May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars are unanimously agreed that the one who does not     pray because he denies that it is obligatory is a kaafir who is doomed to     remain eternally in the fire of Hell if he dies in that state, but they     differed concerning the one who does not pray, not because he denies that it     is obligatory, but because he is lazy and heedless. The majority of them     said that he should be asked to repent, and if he repents all well and good,     otherwise he is to be executed as a hadd punishment. Others said that he     should be given a disciplinary punishment (ta’zeer) and imprisoned until he     starts to pray. So there are three opinions concerning this issue:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The first opinion: that the one who does not pray is a     kaafir, without differentiating between the one who denies it and the one     who is lazy. This is the view of the Sahaabah, and no difference of opinion     is known among them. Among those who hold this view are: Imam Ahmad (may     Allaah have mercy on him) according to the more correct of the two opinions     narrated from him, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and Mansoor     al-Faqeeh among the Shaafa’is. It was also narrated from Abu’l-Tayyib ibn     Salamah among the Shaafa’is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The second opinion: that the one who does not pray because he     is lazy and heedless, not because he denies it, is one of the evildoers     among the Muslims, but he is not a kaafir. However, he should be asked to     repent -- although they differed concerning the time that should be allowed     for that -- then if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he is to be     executed as a hadd punishment! Like the married adulterer, but he should be     executed with the sword. This is the view of Maalik and his companions, and     it is the view of al-Shaafa’i and most of his companions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The view that someone like this should be executed as a hadd     punishment is subject to further discussion. We have explained the error of     this opinion in the answer to question number    <a href=\"/en/answers/6035\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">6035</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The third opinion: that the person who does not pray     deliberately, because he is lazy and heedless, although he acknowledges that     it is obligatory, is not a kaafir and should not be executed, rather he     should be given a disciplinary punishment (ta’zeer) and imprisoned until he     begins to pray.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is the view of Imam Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy     on him) and his companions, and of a number of the people of Kufah, Sufyaan     al-Thawri, and of al-Mazani the companion of al-Shaafa’i, but it is the     weakest of the opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Many practical rulings are based on the difference in opinion     on the ruling on one who does not pray, such as: whether he inherits,     inheritance from him, whether he is to be washed and buried in the Muslim     graveyard, whether the funeral prayer is to be offered for him, ruling on     meat slaughtered or hunted by him, whether his marriage remains valid and     other rulings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For those who say that the one who does not pray is a kaafir     -- even if he does not deny it is obligatory -- all the rulings on apostates     apply to him. So he cannot inherit or be inherited from, he cannot be washed     (after he dies), he cannot be buried in the Muslim graveyard, the funeral     prayer cannot be offered for him, meat slaughtered by him is not halaal and     his marriage contract becomes invalid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For those who ruled that he is not a kaafir, the rulings     mentioned above do not apply to him; rather he is regarded as an evildoer     among the Muslims and one who is committing a major sin, but the majority of     them say that he should be asked to repent, then if he does not pray, he is     to be executed as a hadd punishment! Similarly -- in their view -- if he is     married to a Christian or Jewish woman, then his marriage contract is deemed     to be valid, and is the marriage contract between a Muslim man and a woman     from the People of the Book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The more correct of these two opinions is the first one,     because of the apparent meaning of the evidence from the Qur'aan and Sunnah,     and because of the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with     them) concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is what was stated in fatwas by shaykhs such as:     Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Muhammad ibn Saalih     al-‘Uthaymeen, the scholars of the Standing Committee and others, despite     the difference of opinion concerning the hadd punishment which the one who     does not pray is thought to deserve.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that: the marriage contract between this man and     that woman is a marriage contract between an apostate and the Christian     woman -- if she is still following her religion -- and her situation is less     serious than his, because she is a woman of the People of the Book, whilst     he is an apostate from his religion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answers to questions number    <a href=\"/en/answers/2182\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">2182</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/5208\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">5208</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/33007\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">33007</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/10094\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">10094</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the woman asked about, if she has become     Muslim, it is not permissible for her to stay with a man who does not pray.     The ruling on that has been discussed above in detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if she is still a nonbeliever, then their are no rulings     that have to do with her marriage to him, because they are both not Muslim.     Neither of them is Muslim so that the rulings of sharee’ah would apply to     their marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We advise her to leave this man and marry a man who is really     a Muslim. Because he does not pray, he is not regarded as a Muslim, and the     evils and sins that he commits are not part of the Muslim’s attitude.     Moreover, as seems to be the case to us from the question, he is lacking in     chivalry and decency, because he agrees to his wife going out to work and     bearing the burden of earning a living, whilst he sits at home. By Allaah,     his attitude would be wrong even if he were staying home to read Qur'aan and     pray, whilst his wife goes out to work and support him, so what should we     say about him when he is staying home to commit sin and evil?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What we say to this wife is: O female slave of Allaah, do not     look at the religion on the basis of its people or on the basis of one of     them; rather look at what there is in it of truth, goodness, honesty and     righteousness. As for the people, if your husband is as you describe, then     among the Muslims there are people who adhere to its etiquette, rulings and     morals and manners apart from this man. There are still people, among both     Muslims and non-Muslims, who are sincere, righteous and decent, and there     are some who are not like that. But the attitude of the Muslim, if he still     follows his religion properly is more sublime and more righteous and purer     than the attitude of others. Think about it and you will find that this is     true. Remember that most of the Muslims around you are interested in worldly     gains and greed, and they have gone against the rulings of their religion     which forbid living in the lands of the kuffaar for the sake of worldly     gains and greed, so what kind of attitude do you expect from them? Very few     of them adhere to the commands of their religion, or they are living there     for a reason which makes that permissible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    O female slave of Allaah, hasten and do not delay; do not let     people and their attitudes be a barrier between you and light from your     Lord. Every soul is a pledge for that which it has earned, and people will     be called to account on the Day of Resurrection one by one, and no soul will     bear the burden of another: it will get what it deserves, good or bad. So     come to the light that you have seen, and beware of delaying, lest darkness     overwhelm you and the light of guidance disappear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If there is something that is keeping you away from the     light, remove it from your eyes no matter what it is, and hasten towards     your Lord on His straight path.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Can you differentiate clearly the difference between crying for a deceased person and wailing? Does wailing include shouting, and voicing your grief... and crying simply tears? This is confusing and I need clarity due to wailing being a sin.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Crying is well known; it refers to tears from the eyes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for wailing, according to the scholars has to do with words and sounds that come from the woman or man who is wailing. The words referred to here are eulogizing, listing his good qualities, keening (the well known chanting of women when they wail and lament), screaming and other well-known actions that are done by wailing women.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some fuqaha’ say that this applies if there is also crying, and others say that it is not necessarily accompanied by crying; rather it is connected to the actions of wailing mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the hadeeth: it was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah fell sick and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to visit him with ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas and ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas‘’ood (may Allah be pleased with them). When he entered upon him, he found him unconscious with his family around him and he said: “Has he died?” They said: No, O Messenger of Allaah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wept, and when the people saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) weeping, they also wept. He said: “Listen, Allaah does not punish for the tears of the eye or the grief of the heart, rather He punishes for this” – and he pointed to his tongue – “or shows mercy (because of it).”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1304; Muslim, 924&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and one of his daughters sent word to him, calling him and informing him that a child of hers – or a son of hers – was dying. He said to the messenger: “Go back to her and tell her that to Allaah belongs that which He has taken, and to Him belongs what He gives, and everything has an appointed time with Him. Tell her to be patient and seek reward.” Then the messenger came back and said: “She is adjuring you to come to her.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up, and Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah and Mu‘adh ibn Jabal got up with him, and I went with them. The child was lifted up to him and his soul was rattling like water poured into a waterskin. His eyes filled with tears and Sa‘d said to him: What is this, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: “This is compassion that Allaah has instilled in the hearts of His slaves. Allaah only shows mercy to the merciful ones among His slaves.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1284; Muslim, 923&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What this means is that Sa‘d thought that all kinds of crying or weeping were haraam, and that tears from the eye are haraam, and he thought that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had forgotten that, so he reminded him. But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him that simply crying or shedding tears from the eye is not haraam or makrooh; rather it is mercy and a virtue. What is haraam is wailing and lamenting and crying that is accompanied by both or one of them. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He committed zina with a woman; is he allowed to marry her daughter?",
      "question": "<p>I am a thirty year old man. The shaytaan tempted me and I committed zina with a woman, then Allaah blessed me and had mercy on me, and I repented sincerely to Allaah, may Allaah accept it from me. Until now I have not gotten married. I have decided to get married and my mother has suggested a girl, but this girl is the daughter of the woman with whom I committed zina before (please note that the zina occurred two years ago, and her daughter is now twenty years old). Hence I hope that you can advise me whether this marriage is haraam or not? I hope that you can explain fully.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We ask     Allaah to accept your repentance. Strive to make it a sincere repentance,     because the crime of zina is a grave sin which results in many evils. The     married man who commits zina deserves to be stoned to death, and there is no     greater punishment than that among the hudood punishments, because of the     abhorrent and repugnant nature of this crime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice     to you is not to marry this girl, not because marrying her is haraam, but     because through this marriage you will become closer to her mother with whom     you committed zina, and getting close to her will remind you of that evil     sin, and the shaytaan may whisper to you again, and make sin appear     attractive to you, so you fall into it. Keeping away from reminders of evil     and sin is part of repentance. This is indicated by the hadeeth about the     one who killed one hundred people; the scholar told him to leave his village     because its people were evil and immoral people. This is part of repenting     fully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard     to whether it is permissible to marry this girl, there was a difference of     opinion among the scholars regarding such cases. Al-Shaafa’i and Maalik –     according to one of the two reports narrated from him – said that it is     permissible, but Abu Haneefah, Ahmad and Maalik – according to the other     report – said that such a marriage is haraam. The more correct is the first     view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd     al-Barr said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They     differed concerning a man who commits zina with a woman; is it permissible     for him to marry her daughter or mother? Similarly, if he committed zina     with a woman, can his son or father marry her? In all these cases, does zina     make haraam what a valid marriage or an invalid marriage makes haraam (i.e.,     makes certain relatives mahrams to whom marriage is forbidden)?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maalik said     in his Muwatta’: Zina with a woman does not make it haraam for the     one who commits zina with her to marry her daughter or mother. If a man     commits zina with the mother of his wife, his wife does not become haraam to     him, rather he should be killed. Zina does not make haraam anything that a     permissible marriage makes haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the     view of Ibn Shihaab al-Zuhri and Rabee’ah; it was also the view of al-Layth     ibn Sa’d, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Thawr and Dawood. It was also narrated from Ibn     ‘Abbaas, who said concerning that: A haraam deed does not make something     permissible haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn     al-Qaasim narrated from Maalik something other than what is said in     al-Muwatta’. He said: If a man commits zina with the mother of his wife,     he must be separated from his wife, and in his view he comes under the     ruling of one who has married his wife’s mother and consummated the marriage     with her. This is also the view of Abu Haneefah and his companions, and of     al-Thawri and al-Awzaa’i, all of whom said that if a man commits zina with     his wife’s mother, then his wife becomes haraam for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sahnoon     said: The companions of Maalik all disagreed with Ibn al-Qaasim on this     matter and they agreed with what it says in al-Muwatta’. Allaah has     forbidden the Muslim to marry his wife’s mother or daughter. If a man owns a     slave woman and he has intercourse with her, then her mother and daughter     also become haraam for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly,     if his father has intercourse with a woman whom he marries or owns as a     slave, they become haraam for the son, and vice versa. This has to do with     permissible types of intercourse. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>These     fuqaha’ – the ones who were qualified to issue fatwas in the Islamic regions     – were unanimously agreed that it is not haraam for a man to marry a woman     with whom he committed zina, if it is established that she is not pregnant,     so it is more likely that he is permitted to marry her mother or daughter.     And Allaah is the source of strength.</p>\n<p>Al-Istidhkaar     (5/463, 464).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh     Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The correct     view is that the mother of a woman with whom a man has committed zina is not     haraam for the one who did that, and the daughter of the woman with whom he     committed zina is not haraam for the one who did that, because Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“All     others are lawful”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’     4:24]</p>\n<p>Allaah did     not mention the mother or daughter of a woman with whom zina has been     committed as being among those to whom marriage is forbidden, rather He     said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“your     wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your     wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not     gone in them (to marry their daughters),”</p>\n<p>[al-Nisa’     4:23]</p>\n<p>It is well     known that the woman with whom a man has committed zina is not one of his     wives at all. As she is not one of his wives, it is not valid to compare     fornication to valid marriage. If he has repented from zina it is     permissible for him to marry the mother or daughter of a woman with whom he     committed zina. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh     al-Mumti’ (7/38, 39)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conclusion:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a     matter concerning which the scholars differed. The correct view is that it     is permissible to marry the daughter of a woman with whom one has committed     zina so long as she is not one’s own daughter, but our advice to you is     not to marry her for two reasons: to be on the safe side, because she is     haraam for you according to many of the scholars, and so that your marriage     to her will not be a cause of your getting close to her mother and getting     in touch with her, which may lead to you going back to that sin from which     you have repented. And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

The kind of touching which breaks wudu is <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/175180\" target=\"_blank\">physical touching</a> with no barrier in between.
