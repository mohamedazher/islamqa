      "title": "If a poor person is able to do a job that is not befitting for him, can he take zakaah funds?",
      "question": "<p>There are poor families who have grown-up children who are able to earn money, but they do not work on the grounds that this work is not befitting for them. Should they be given zakaah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to give zakaah to a poor person who is     able to earn a living, because he is not regarded as poor so long as he is     able to earn a living by working.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Adiyy ibn al-Khayyaar     from two men who were Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) that they came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) and asked him for charity. He looked at them and     saw that they were strong and said: “If you wish, I will give to you but     there is no share in it for one who is independent of means or one who is     strong and able to earn a living.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (1633); its isnaad     was classed as saheeh by al-Nawawi in Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (1/171) and     by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood (5/335).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in Fiqh al-‘Ibaadaat (1/295), which is a     Maaliki book: The one who is independent of means is the one who has what is     sufficient for one year, or he is able to earn a living, or he has a salary     that suffices him. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In al-Minhaaj ma‘a Mughni al-Muhtaaj (4/173) it says:     The poor man (faqeer) is the one who has no wealth and no means of earning a     living and meeting his needs. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever has     a means of earning a living that will make him and his dependents, if he has     dependents, independent of means and he has enough to suffice him every day,     is “rich” and has no right to zakaah. This is the view of Ibn ‘Umar and     al-Shaafa‘i … End quote from al-Mugni, 6/324&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But it is stipulated that the work by which he earns a living     should be befitting for him; if it is not befitting for him, such as if he     is one of the prominent people then he becomes poor, he is not obliged to do     work that is not befitting for him, so he should not be obliged to work in a     shop and the like. It is permissible to give zakaah to one who is like this.     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Ghazaali was asked about a strong man from a prominent     family who usually do not earn a living through physical work; can he take     zakaah from the share of the poor and needy?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He said: Yes, this is in accordance with what is mentioned     above, that what matters is a profession that is befitting for him. End     quote from Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, 6/175&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In al-Minhaaj it says: The faqeer (poor person) is the     one who has no wealth and cannot earn enough to meet his needs. And he is     still regarded as poor even if he can earn a living in something that is not     befitting for him. End quote. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The commentator al-Sharahbeeni said in Mughni al-Muhtaaj,     4/174&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    i.e., it is not befitting for him with regard to his status     and dignity, because it undermines his dignity, so it is as if (that job)     does not exist. The word ‘earning” in the hadeeth is to be interpreted as     referring to permissible and suitable means of earning. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    To sum up: with regard to people who do not work on the     grounds that the work is not befitting for them, if the work is indeed not     befitting to them, they may take zakaah. But if the work is befitting and     others like them do this kind of work without any reluctance, it is not     permissible to give them zakaah; rather they should be advised to work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "What is meant by sahoor in the hadiths that speak of its virtue is the sahoor of those who fast in particular",
      "question": "<p>With regard to sahoor in the hadith of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Verily Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels send blessings upon those who eat sahoor”, or in other hadiths, does this mean that the barakah (blessing) is only for those who fast, or is it the case that at the time of sahoor on any day it is mustahabb to have sahoor, even if it is only a sip of water?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Sahoor refers to the food or drink that is consumed by a person at the end of the night. It is called sahoor because it is consumed at the time of sahr which is the end of the night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lisaan al-‘Arab (4/351)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are a number of hadiths that speak of the virtue of sahoor, such as that in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat sahoor, for in sahoor there is blessing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1923) and Muslim (1095). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The difference between our fasting and the fasting of the People of the Book is the meal before dawn (sahoor).” Narrated by Muslim (1096). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels send blessings upon those who eat sahoor.” Narrated by Ahmad (11086); classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (1654)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by sahoor in these hadiths is the food eaten before dawn by the one who is going to fast in particular, because that food gives the fasting person strength for the act of worship that is fasting, and makes it easier for him. Moreover it is the sahoor that differentiates between our fast – us Muslims – and the fast of the People of the Book. This is understood from the comments of the scholars about the reason why sahoor is regarded as a blessing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars are unanimously agreed that it (sahoor) is mustahabb but is not obligatory. As for the barakah that is in it, it is obvious, because it gives one strength and energy to fast, and because of it one wants to fast more, because it reduces the hardship involved for the one who eats sahoor. This is the correct view concerning its significance.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim (7/206)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Verily Allah, may He be exalted, and His angels send blessings upon those who eat sahoor”: That is, those who eat sahoor with the aim of strengthening themselves for the fast, because of what it does of calming the desires of the stomach and private part, which leads to purification of the heart and dominance of the spiritual over the physical, which brings one closer to one’s Lord, may He be exalted. Therefore sahoor is very highly recommended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer (2/270)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/270):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sahoor is Sunnah for the one who fasts. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that there was consensus on its being recommended. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is prescribed for the one who fasts is to eat sahoor before dawn breaks, because that gives one strength for fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (9/26)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily in sahoor there is barakah (blessing).” Where is the barakah? All of it is barakah, for it is an act of worship, following the example of the Messenger, differing from the people of Hell, helping oneself to fast, and giving one’s nafs its rights, because it will be followed by a time of self-restraint, so it gets its share of food and drink so as to gain strength for carrying out an act of worship; it is the precursor to the fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (7/147)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The barakah in sahoor is attained in several ways: it is following the Sunnah, differing from the People of the Book, giving oneself strength to do an act of worship, increases one’s energy, wards off the bad attitude that may stem from hunger, is a means of giving charity to one who asks for it at that time or joins a person when eating, it enables one to remember Allah and call upon Him at a time when the response is hoped for, and it helps one to form the intention of fasting, for one who forgot to do so before going to sleep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fath al-Baari (4/140)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of these reasons mentioned by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) are not only applicable to the one who fasts, but they are connected to the intention of fasting, for the intention of fasting is the basis, which is followed by these benefits of eating sahoor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars are unanimously agreed that sahoor is mustahabb for one who is fasting, but we do not know of anyone among the scholars who said that it is mustahabb for one who is not fasting. If sahoor was mustahabb both for one who is fasting and one who is not, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have always eaten sahoor, but he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not do that, which indicates that sahoor is only mustahabb for the one who wants to fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on stoning the Jamaraat with a piece of concrete",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on stoning the Jamaraat with a piece of concrete? It looked the same as the stones to me, until someone pointed that out to me on the second day. Do I have to repeat the stoning? What is the ruling on stoning the Jamaraat with a piece of a big rock after breaking it into small pieces?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The majority of fuqaha’ stipulated that the Jamaraat should be stoned with pebbles, which are small stones of whatever type of rock. Concrete is not rock, so it is not acceptable, according to the majority.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is acceptable to stone the Jamaraat with anything that is called pebbles, which are small stones, whether they are black or white or red, and whether they are marble, flint, granite and so on. This is the view of Maalik and ash-Shaafa‘i. al-Qaadi said: Marble, buraam and kadhdhaan (types of rock) are not acceptable. And we may understand from his words that marble and solid stones are not acceptable either. Abu Haneefah said: It is permissible to use dried clay or mud, or anything that comes from the earth. Something similar was stated by ath-Thawri. It was narrated from Sakeenah bint al-Husayn that she stoned the Jamarah, and a man was handing pebbles to her, and she was saying takbeer with each throw. And she dropped a pebble, so she threw her ring.</p>\n<p>We also have a report that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stoned the Jamaraat with pebbles, and he told the people to throw pebbles the size of chickpeas, so nothing other than pebbles is to be picked up, and that includes pebbles of all types. It is not permissible to single out any particular type without evidence, or to add anything else to it, because it is a topic in which there is no room for analogy.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni, 3/218</p>\n<p>In al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (15/277) it says: When stoning the jamaraat, it is stipulated that the pebbles be of stone, according to the majority of fuqaha’ (Maalikis, Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis). So it is not permissible to use gold, silver, iron, lead, wood, clay, seeds, dust, pearls, antimony or plaster in their view, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) threw pebbles and instructed us to throw pebbles the size of chickpeas, so nothing else should be picked up. The Shaafaa‘is allowed stoning the Jamaraat with all kinds of stones.</p>\n<p>The Hanafis were of the view that it is permissible to stone the Jamaraat with all kinds of things that come from the earth, such as stones, mud and clay, and everything with which it is permissible to do tayammum, but it is not permissible to use wood, amber, pearls or gemstones, because they are not from the earth. End quote.</p>\n<p>Based on this, there is nothing wrong with breaking stones or large rocks and stoning the Jamaraat with them.</p>\n<p>As for throwing concrete or pieces of brick, it is not acceptable according to the majority, although it is acceptable according to the Hanafis. However the view of the majority is more on the safe side.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on stoning the Jamaraat with pieces of concrete?</p>\n<p>He replied: Some scholars think that the stones that are taken from concrete are not acceptable for stoning the Jamaraat, unless this piece of concrete contains stone. If it contains stone then there is nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 23/125</p>\n<p>To sum up: If on the first day you threw pieces of concrete in which there was no stone, then your stoning was not valid according to the majority, and you have to sacrifice a sheep, the meat of which is to be distributed among the poor of the Haram; you may delegate someone to do that on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you cannot afford the price of a sheep, then you do not have to do anything.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He said: “If tomorrow is Ramadaan, then I will fast”",
      "question": "<p>If no announcement had been made about the beginning of Ramadaan, and a person slept early and said: “If tomorrow is the first of Ramadaan then I am fasting,” is this intention sufficient and is his fast valid?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The fuqaha’ differed concerning this matter and there are two views, based on their difference of opinion about making an intention specific. The issue is, does he have to intend to fast specifically for Ramadaan, or is it sufficient for him to have the intention of fasting, whether he intends it as an obligatory or naafil fast? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority of Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that he has to stipulate that he intends to fast for Ramadaan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hanafis are of the view that he does not have to have a specific intention. This was also narrated from Ahmad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this view, the fast of one who says “If tomorrow is Ramadaan then this is my obligatory fast”&nbsp; is valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Furoo’ (3/40): It is essential to form a specific intention for each obligatory fast, according to Maalik and al-Shaafa’i. This means that he should form the intention of fasting Ramadaan or making up a missed fast or fasting in fulfilment of a vow or as an expiation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each person will have but that which he intended.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another view was also narrated from Imam Ahmad, which is that he does not have to form a specific intention for Ramadaan, which is similar to the view of Abu Haneefah, because specifying is for the purpose of distinguishing and the time of Ramadaan is already distinct from other times, therefore the general intention of fasting is valid. If someone wants to form the intention of observing an obligatory fast but he was not certain … &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he said “If someone wants to form the intention of observing an obligatory fast but he was not certain”, such as if he formed his intention on the night of doubt by saying: “If tomorrow is Ramadaan then my fast will be obligatory and if it is not then it will be naafil,” this is not valid, according to the first view, until he is certain that he will fast tomorrow for Ramadaan. But according to the second view it is valid. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Insaaf (3/295): If his intention is “If tomorrow is Ramadaan it will be my obligatory fast otherwise it will be a naafil fast,” this is not valid. This is our view and it is the view of the majority of our companions. This is based on the fact that it is essential to form a specific opinion. It was narrated from Imam Ahmad that this is valid, and this is based on a report that says it is not essential to form a specific intention in the case of Ramadaan. This view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Taqiy al-Deen. It says in al-Faa’iq: This was supported by the author of al-Muharrar and by our Shaykh, and it is the favoured view. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Bahr al-Raa’iq, 2/280; Majma’ al-Anhaar, 1/233; Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 2/150; al-Mughni, 3/9; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 5/165, 28/22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the view of the author of al-Zaad: If his intention is, ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast’, that is not valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This issue is important and comes up frequently. For example: a man slept early on the night before the thirtieth of Sha’baan, and it is possible that this night may be the first of Ramadaan, so he said: ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then it will be my obligatory fast,’ or he said, ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then I am fasting,’ or, ‘If tomorrow is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast, and if it is not then it is an obligatory expiation’ and the like. Our view is that this is not valid, because his words, ‘If it is Ramadaan then it is my obligatory fast’ show a kind of uncertainty, but intentions must be based on certainty. So if he does not wake up until after dawn and he finds out that it is Ramadaan, then he has to make up this day, according to the author.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second view narrated from Imam Ahmad is that his fast is valid if he finds out that it is Ramadaan. This view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). Perhaps this is included in the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr: “Go for Hajj, and stipulate that if you are prevented from continuing, you will exit ihraam at that point and Allaah will accept whatever you stipulate.” This man made his intention conditional because he did not know whether the next day would be Ramadaan, so his hesitation was based on uncertainty about the month, but there was no uncertainty about whether he would fast or not. Hence if he said on the night before the first of Ramadaan: ‘I may fast tomorrow or I may not,’ we say that this is not valid because it is uncertainty. … Based on this, if we go to sleep on the night before the thirtieth of Sha’baan , we may intend that if the next day is Ramadaan, we will fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/375.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>In 1996 I bought a shop for my brother to work in, but the shop has remained closed until now; my brother has not worked in it and I have not benefited from it. It did not enter my mind that zakaah may be due on it until recently. The price of the shop when I bought it was 400,000, then the price dropped to 300,000 in the year 2000. Now the price is between 700,000 and 800,000. In the coming year, in sha Allaah, I will try to open the shop so that someone can work in it and benefit from it.<br />\n<br />\n I hope that you can advise us as to whether zakaah is due on it or not. What can I do if I do not have enough money to pay zakaah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslim     does not have to pay zakaah on his car, house or shop, even if the value of     these things is great. Rather zakaah is due on things that are bought and     sold for the purpose of trade and profit, which are called “trade goods”. If     a person has any property or real estate – land, houses or shops – which he     has acquired for the purpose of trade, buying and selling, then he should     work out their value at the time when zakaah becomes due and pay one-quarter     of one-tenth. But if a person has acquired that property to live in, or to     farm it, or to rent it out or to buy and sell in it, then no zakaah is due     on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars     of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wealth that     people own is of various types. With regard to money, zakaah is due on it if     it reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab) and one hijri year has passed. In     the case of agricultural land, zakaah is due on the grains and crops on the     day of the harvest, not on the land itself. In the case of land or buildings     that are rented out, zakaah is due on the rent when one year has passed, not     on the land or building itself. If the land, building or other goods are for     trade, then zakaah is due on them when one year has passed, and you should     pay zakaah on the profit when one year has passed for the capital, if the     capital has reached the nisaab.

      "question": "<p>When I was reading question no. 125922, I discovered that there is a du‘aa’ that the husband should say when he has intercourse with his wife… I am now four weeks pregnant, but we did not say this du‘aa’; hence I am very worried. What must we do now, so as to protect our child from the Shaytaan? Is there something I can say or do that will take the place of that du‘aa’?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari (6388) and Muslim (1434) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you wants to have intercourse with his wife, let him say, ‘Bismillaah, Allahumma jannibnaa al-shaytaan wa jannib al-Shaytaan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah. O Allah, Keep the Shaytaan away from us and from what You bestow upon us).’ Then if it is decreed that they should have a child, the Shaytaan will never be able to harm him.”</p>\n<p>This hadith contains a promise to the one who says that and is blessed with a child, that the Shaytaan will not harm him, but that does not necessarily mean that if a person does not recite these words at the time of intercourse that the Shaytaan will inevitably harm his child, or that the Shaytaan will inevitably have a share of that intercourse. The hadith does not say that; rather he has missed out on the virtue and protection mentioned here, but if he did not do that because of an excuse, such as if he was unaware of it, or he forgot it at that time, then he will be pardoned, if Allah wills, because of the promise that Allah, may He be exalted, made to the ummah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There are many ways in which the one who missed out on the virtue mentioned here can make up for what he has missed. They include the following:</p>\n<p>01.</p>\n<p>He can strive hard to obey Allah and obey His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in word and deed, to fear Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in secret and in public, and to seek halaal earnings, whilst constantly remembering Allah and reading or reciting Qur’an. All of that will guarantee – by the grace of Allah – that a person himself and his wife and children will be protected.</p>\n<p>Al-Haakim (3395) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82]: They were protected because their father was righteous; there is no mention of whether they were righteous.</p>\n<p>Classed by al-Haakim as saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim; adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab said to his son: I increase my prayer for your sake in the hope that you will be protected for my sake. Then he recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82]. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: There is no believer who dies but Allah will protect his offspring and the offspring of his offspring for his sake. Ibn al-Munkadir said: Allah will protect, for the sake of a righteous man, his children and his children’s children, and the households around him, and they will continue to be under the protection of Allah.</p>\n<p>When a person is preoccupied with obedience to Allah, Allah will protect him in that situation. End quote.</p>\n<p>Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (p. 187)</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi Shaybah (35374) narrated that Khaythamah said: ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) said: Glad tidings to the child of the believer; glad tidings to him, they will be protected after he is gone; and Khaythamah recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82].</p>\n<p>He also (36460) narrated that Abu Moosa said: al-Hasan recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82]. He said: There is no mention of his two children being righteous; Allah protected them for the sake of their father.</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words (interpretation of the meaning), “and their father was a righteous man” [al-Kahf 18:82] indicate that the progeny of a righteous man will be protected, and the barakah (blessing) of his worship will benefit them in this world and the hereafter, and by virtue of his intercession for them, they will be raised&nbsp; to the highest degrees in Paradise so that he may have the joy of the company, as it says in the Qur’an and is mentioned in the Sunnah. End quote.</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer (5/186-187)</p>\n<p>02.</p>\n<p>Another matter to which attention should be paid in the hope that the child will be righteous is to release him from the pledge by offering the ‘aqeeqah on the seventh day after his birth, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah, which is to be sacrificed on his behalf on the seventh day, his head is to be shaved, and he is to be given his name.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Abu Dawood (2838); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.</p>\n<p>It was said that what is meant is that the ‘aqeeqah is a means of freeing the child from the Shaytaan and protecting him from him.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12448\">12448</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60252\">60252</a></p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The apparent meaning of the hadith is that he himself is kept in pledge and prevented and detained from some goodness intended for him, but that does not imply that he will be punished for that in the hereafter, even though he may be prevented, because of his parents not doing the ‘aqeeqah, from that which another may get for whom his parents did do the ‘aqeeqah. And the child may miss out on some good because of his parents’ negligence, even though that is not his fault. End quote.</p>\n<p>Zaad al-Ma‘aad (2/326)</p>\n<p>03.</p>\n<p>Supplication (du‘aa’) is another shar‘i means of protecting one’s children, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says concerning His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the Muttaqoon (pious)’”</p>\n<p>[al-Furqaan 25:74].</p>\n<p>Ibn Jareer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says: those who turn to Allah in their du‘aa’ and ask of Him by saying: “Our Lord! Bestow on us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes” by causing us to see them doing acts of worship and obedience to You. End quote.</p>\n<p>Tafseer at-Tabari (19/318)</p>\n<p>Then he narrated that al-Hasan and Sulaymaan at-Taymi said concerning the phrase “the comfort of our eyes”: (This refers to) the believer seeing his wife and children obeying Allah.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>So they ask Him to give them the joy of seeing their spouses and children complying with His commands. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ar-Rooh (p. 252)</p>\n<p>04.</p>\n<p>Ruqya as prescribed in Islam is a means of protecting one’s children. Al-Bukhaari (3271) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your father (Ibraaheem) used to seek refuge with (these words) for Ismaa‘eel and Ishaaq: A‘oodhu bi kalimaat Illaahi’t-taammah min kulli shaytaanin wa haammah wa min kulli ‘aynin laammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from every devil and every vermin, and from every bad eye)”.</p>\n<p>05.</p>\n<p>It is also worth pointing out with regard to this issue that children should be prevented from going out (after sunset) until it is fully dark, because that is the time at which the devils come out. It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the wings of the night spread&nbsp; – or when evening comes – keep your children in, for the devils come out at that time. Then when part of the night has passed, let them go. And close the doors and mention the name of Allah, for the Shaytaan does not open a closed door. And tie up your waterskins and mention the name of Allah, and cover your vessels and mention the name of Allah, even if you only put something over them, and extinguish your lamps.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5623) and Muslim (2012).</p>\n<p>The phrase “when the wings of the night spread” refer to the time after the sun has set, which is the first part of the night.</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad (14482) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Keep your children in until after it is fully dark, for that is a time when the devils come out.”</p>\n<p>The phrase “until it is fully dark” refers to the first part of the night.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, adopting the measures prescribed in Islam with regard to raising children is the basis for protecting them from the accursed Shaytaan.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He hears music sometimes in school without wanting to; is that a sin?",
      "question": "<p>I have previously stopped listening to music, by me not putting it on, but I hear it at school and other places, where I try not to enjoy it but sometimes I do?<br />\n<br />\nWould that count as listening, and would I be accounted for it or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>           There is a difference between the one who listens to           music and the one who hears it. The one who listens to songs hears them           deliberately, wants to hear them and enjoys that, whereas the one who           only hears the sound that reaches him, without wanting or intending           to do so, such as when riding in an airplane or a bus in which there           is music, or who goes to the marketplace and hears that from some stores           without wanting or intending to listen to it. There is a difference           between the latter and the one who sits down to listen to and enjoy           this haraam thing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           Hence Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: The command and the prohibition           have to do with listening. Merely hearing something is like seeing;           it has to do with the intention behind seeing, not what happens without           a person choosing it…. The same applies to committing sin through the           five senses of hearing, sight, smell, taste and touch; the commands           and prohibitions are connected to what a person intends and does, but           whatever happens without him choosing it, there is no command or prohibition           with regard to that.</p>\n<p>           (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, part 5, p. 566)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           One has to denounce that evil as much as possible, but           if he cannot do that, then he should denounce it in his heart. One of           the things implied by denouncing it in one’s heart is not remaining           in a gathering or a place where that evil is happening, if one is able           to leave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           With regard to listening to it, one must strive against           that as much as possible and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan,           and remember Allaah. Then Allaah will take that away from you. If that           makes your heart attracted to it, then you should keep away from those           parts of the school. If it will not cause you a lot of trouble to miss           some of those classes in which these things happen then you should not           attend them. You have to remember that Allaah is always watching and           fear Him, for whoever fears Allaah, Allaah will give him a way out.           Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to           Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)”</p>\n<p>           [al-Talaaq 65:2]</p>\n<p>           And Allaah is the Source of strength.</p>\n",

The symposium was held with the participation of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, the regional office of the World Health Organisation in Alexandria and the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture, 23-25 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1419 AH/13-15 October 1998. A number of senior jurists, doctors, pharmacists, specialists in biological science and scholars from the humanities participated in the symposium.</p>\n<p>Among the recommendations made were the following:</p>\n<p>3. Genetic engineering:</p>\n<p>The symposium has discussed the topic of genetic engineering and the reservations and fears with which it has been surrounded since its inception in the 1970s, because if it is practised without any guidelines or restrictions, it is a two-edged sword which may be used for good or for ill.</p>\n<p>The symposium thinks that it is permissible to use it to prevent, treat or mitigate disease, whether through gene surgery which replaces one gene with another or inserts a gene into the patient’s cells, or inserts a gene into another living being in order to replicate that gene in larger numbers so that it may be used to treat some diseases. However, use of genetic engineering on reproductive cells should be prevented, because of the Shar`i reservations concerning that.</p>\n<p>The symposium affirms the necessity of states providing such services to their citizens of modest income who need it, because it is very costly to provide.</p>\n<p>The symposium thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering for evil purposes or to cross the genetic barrier between different species for the purpose of creating hybrid beings for the purpose of entertainment or out of scientific curiosity.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the symposium thinks that it is not permissible to use genetic engineering as a means of changing the genetic structure for the purpose of what is called eugenics, or any attempt to tamper with the genetic make-up of humans, or to interfere with an individual’s ability to be individually responsible. All of these are matters that are prohibited according to Islamic teachings. …</p>\n<p>The symposium does not think that there is anything wrong, in Islamic terms, with using genetic engineering in the fields of agriculture and animal husbandry, but the symposium cannot ignore the voices that have recently warned of the possibility of long-term harm that could affect humans, animals, agriculture or the environment, and it thinks that companies and factories that produce foods of animal or vegetable origin should point out to the public anything offered for sale that is produced through genetic engineering (or genetic modification – GMO), so that the purchaser will be aware of what he is buying. The symposium also recommends monitoring the consequences of genetic modification of foods, and they should follow the advice and recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration, the World Health Organisation and the World Food Programme in particular.</p>\n<p>The symposium notes the necessity of establishing organisations to protect and educate consumers in the Muslim world.</p>\n<p>In other recommendations, it says:</p>\n<p>12. The scholars of the Muslim world should write books simplifying scientific information about heredity and genetic engineering, so as to spread awareness and support concerning this issue.</p>\n<p>13. Muslim countries should introduce genetic engineering through a program of education at various levels, paying particular attention to university studies and postgraduate education<em>.\" (Majallat Majma` Al-Fiqh Al-Islami,</em> issue no. 11, Vol. 3, p.533)</p>\n<p>Based on that, there is nothing wrong with studying human genetic engineering and using it for beneficial and permissible purposes only.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers:&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21582</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111969\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">111969</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/119830\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">119830</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
