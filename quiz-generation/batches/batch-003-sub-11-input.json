      "question": "<p>The father of one of my friends has died and it was necessary to attend the dinner that they offered to the people present. Whilst we were waiting for the food to be served, some of the people present began to recite Qur’aan together, and I am aware that this is an innovation and that it is not proven from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and his family). <br />\n<br />\nI wanted to object to this action but I was afraid of causing trouble and I did not have sufficient evidence.<br />\n<br />\nWas I sinning by being present and listening to their recitation? <br />\n<br />\nShould I have objected to them, even if that was by saying that there is no proof of this from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not \tpermissible for the family of the deceased to make food and invite people to \tcome and eat. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade \tthat. Jareer ibn ‘Abdullah said: We used to regard gathering with the family \tof the deceased and making food after the burial as coming under the same \theading as wailing.. Narrated by Ahmad, 6866; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \tin Talkhees Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not \tpermissible to go to these meals and gatherings; rather what must be done is \tto tell people not to do that and to explain to them that it is contrary to \tIslam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard \tto reciting Qur’aan together, if the group starts to recite Qur’aan together \tin unison, this is another innovation; this was not narrated from the \tProphet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or from any of his \tCompanions.</p>\n<p>This has \tbeen discussed previously in the answer to question no.\t<a href=\"/en/answers/4039\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">4039</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on \tthat, you should not have attended this gathering and if you did attend, \tthen you should have explained to them that this action is not prescribed in \tIslam. If they did not respond to you then you should have left the place, \tbecause the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\t“Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let \thim change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his\ttongue [by speaking out]; and if he \tcannot, then with his heart – and that is the weakest of faith.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by \tMuslim, 49&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Part of \tobjecting to evil in the heart is leaving the place where it is happening.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also the \tanswer the question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/96662\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">96662</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Her brother cheated her and bought her share for a very low price, and is refusing to give her anything on the grounds that she agreed to the sale",
      "question": "<p>My father died and left behind a tannery; my brother took over running it and he was paying us rent. Two months ago, I asked him to buy my share, because I needed the money. I did not know the value of my share, and I did not ask anyone, because I trusted my brother. So he bought it for 60,000 pounds. Two weeks later, he bought from the rest of my sisters their shares in the tannery, paying each one 160,000 pounds, i.e., more than double (what he had paid me). I found out that the government estimated it at a higher price, because the business is going to be moved, and he knew and my sisters all knew, except me. Now he has cheated me, because he knew the real price, but when I asked him to give me the rest of the money, he said to me: You sold it and you agreed (to that price), and I bought it. Do I really have no right to ask for the rest of my dues like my sisters? Or will he bear a burden of sin, and is he obliged to give me the rest of what is due to me, because he deceived me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If someone sells something to another person who is unaware of its real price and did not bargain about the price, trusting the purchaser to be honest, then finds out that he was cheated, he has the choice to annul the deal.</p>\n<p>He has the right to ask the purchaser for the rest of the price, and if the purchaser refuses, then the seller has the right to cancel the deal, take back the items sold, and give back to the purchaser the price that he paid.</p>\n<p>The fuqahaa’ differed with regard to the percentage of the price that is regarded as cheating – whether it is one third or one fifth or what is regarded by traders as being unfair and cheating – but if your brother bought from your sisters their shares, which were the same as your share, for 160,000, and this was the market price, then what happened to you is cheating and is unfair according to scholarly consensus.</p>\n<p>It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (7/435) regarding one who has the right to cancel a deal that is regarded as unfair and cheating: … the third case is one who entered into a transaction on the basis of trust. What is meant here is one who was unaware of the real value, whether he was a seller or a purchaser, and is not good at bargaining. He has the option of annulling the deal if he was cheated of the percentage mentioned above, i.e., by a percentage that is out of the ordinary, because that unfair deal took place because of his ignorance (of the real value). Therefore he has the right to annul the deal.</p>\n<p>But in the case of one who has experience and is aware of the price of the item sold, but enters into a transaction knowing that the price is unfair, and one who accepts an unfair price because he was in a hurry to sell, and if he had paused to think and had not rushed, that unfair transaction would not have taken place – in these cases they do not have the right to annul the deal, because there was no cheating or deceit in this case. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone buys an item for 2500 riyals, when it is only worth 1500 riyals, if the seller knew that the price was 1500 riyals, but he knew that this man was a stranger who did not know prices, and he sold it to him for 2500, then he is sinning and it is not permissible for him to do that; if the buyer finds out, then he has the right to annul the deal, and this is described as an annulment due to an unfair deal, because 1000 out of 2500 is a lot. But if it was slightly unfair, such as a 10% difference, then that does not matter, because people commonly do deals that involve slight overcharging or undercharging.</p>\n<p>But if the seller does not know – for example, if the price is 2500 but prices have fallen, and the seller is unaware of the fall in prices, then the seller is not sinning, but the purchaser still has the right to annul the deal, because he has been subject to an unfair deal.</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqaa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (56/14).</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: if someone were to ask: is it possible for the seller to enter into an unfair deal and be cheated?</p>\n<p>The answer is: Yes, this happened a great deal, especially in earlier times. For example, a trader might know that sugar was rising in price, so he would go to people who had sugar and buy all that they had at the current price, when they did not know that its value had risen. This is undoubtedly unfair and is cheating, and the sellers were not being negligent when they sold it at that price, because when they sold it they thought that that was the correct value and that the prices were stable.</p>\n<p>To sum up: just as the purchaser has the right to cancel the deal if he finds out that he got into an unfair deal, the seller also has the right, if he finds that he got into an unfair deal, to cancel the deal. There is no difference in that regard.</p>\n<p>End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (8/303).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The right to cancel an unfair deal gives the one who finds that he has been cheated the choice between annulling the deal or going ahead with the deal without any compensation.</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars said: he has the right to choose between cancelling the deal or going ahead with the deal with compensation, which is to make up for the difference in price.</p>\n<p>According to the first view, you have the right to cancel the deal, then to sell your share for the price that you want.</p>\n<p>According to the second view, you have the right to go ahead with the deal and to be given the difference, which is 100,000.</p>\n<p>It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (3/212):</p>\n<p>The purchaser has a choice between returning the goods or keeping them.</p>\n<p>Ibn Rajab said in Sharh al-Arba‘een an-Nawawiyyah: The price should be reduced for the purchaser to a level that is fair, if he has been cheated, and the extra amount should be returned to him if he has already&nbsp; paid it.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Does saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse protect one against major sins?",
      "question": "<p>Does saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse protect the child from committing major sins?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “If one of you says, when he has intercourse with his wife: ‘Bismillaah, Allaahumma jannibni al-Shaytaana wa jannib al-Shaytaana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allaah, O Allaah, keep the Shaytaan away from me and keep the Shaytaan away from that which You bestow upon us),’ if it is decreed that they should have a child, the Shaytaan will never harm him.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5165; Muslim, 1434.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to how this benefits the child, the scholars differed as to what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “the Shaytaan will never harm him.” There are many opinions:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That what it means is that the Shaytaan will not control him because of the blessing of saying Bismillaah, rather he will be one of the people of whom it was said: “Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves” [al-Hijr 15:42].</p>\n<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that he will never harm him physically.</p>\n<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that this is a means of his being protected from shirk and kufr.</p>\n<p>4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that he will keep away from major sins.</p>\n<p>5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was said that he will not be harmed by the Shaytaan’s participation in his father’s having intercourse with his mother, as it was narrated that Mujaahid said: The one who has intercourse and does not say Bismillaah, the Shaytaan wraps himself around his penis and has intercourse along with him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar said: Perhaps this is the most correct answer. But the first answer may also be correct, especially since we know that many people who know about the great blessing of saying Bismillaah may forget all about it at the time of intercourse, and for the few who may remember it and say it, pregnancy may not occur. If this is very rare, then it is possible that the first answer may be correct.</p>\n",

      "title": "Any Benefits of Reciting Surah Ad-Dukhan on Friday?",
      "question": "<p>Is it Sunnah (from the Prophet’s teachings) to read Surah Ad-Dukan on the night before Friday?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There are marfoo‘ Hadiths (reports attributed to the prophet) about the virtue of reading <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11722\" target=\"_blank\">Surah Ad-Dukhan</a> on the night before Friday, but none of them are saheeh (authentic).&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Ha-Mim <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/115841\" target=\"_blank\">(Surah) Ad-Dukan</a> on the night before Friday will be forgiven.”&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It was narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2889) via Hisham Abu Al-Miqdam, from Al-Hasan, from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We only know this Hadith through this isnad, and Hisham Abu’l-Miqdam is inauthentic. And Al-Hasan did not hear from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). This was the view of Ayyub, Yunus ibn ‘Ubayd and ‘Ali ibn Zayd.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus the Hadith has two faults:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abu Al-Miqdam Hisham ibn Ziyad (may Allah have mercy on him): the scholars of Hadith unanimously agreed that he is to be regarded as da‘eef. Ibn Hibban said: He narrates fabricated reports from trustworthy narrators, and it is not permissible to quote him as evidence. (See: Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, 11/39)</li>\n<li>There is a break in the chain of narrators between Al-Hasan and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence it was classed as inauthentic by Ibn Al-Jawzi in Al-Mawdu`at (1/247), Ibn Al-‘Arabi in ‘Aridah Al-Ahwadhi, 6/35, and Al-Albani in Da`if At-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"2\">In his Tafsir (exegesis) (4/46), Al-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated a Hadith from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) that is similar to the Hadith quoted above, except that its chain of narrators includes Sallam ibn Salim who is accused of lying. Hence, As-Shaykh Al-Albani, in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (no. 4632), ruled that it is very inauthentic.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ahmad ibn Mani` also narrated it from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) in his Musnad, as it says in Al-Busayri’s Ithaf Al-Khiyarah Al-Maharah (6/89). Then he said: This chain of narrators is weak because Harun ibn Kathir is not known. &nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\">It was narrated from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Whoever recites Ha-Mim (Surah) Ad-Dukhan on the night before Friday or on Friday, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir (8/264).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As-Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“(It is) very inauthentic. It was narrated by Al-Asfahani in At-Targheeb wa At-Tarhib (p. 244) from Hafs ibn ‘Umar Al-Mazini: Fidal ibn Jubayr told us, from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) in a narration attributed directly to the Prophet …”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I [Ash-Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him)] say: “This chain of narrators is da‘eef jiddan. With regard to Fidal ibn Jubayr, Ibn Hibban said: It is not permissible to quote him as evidence under any circumstances; he narrated Hadiths that have no basis. Because of him, Al-Haythami regarded it as a faulty Hadith and said (2/168): It was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Kabeer and its isnad includes Fidal ibn Jubayr, who is very inauthentic, and Hafs ibn ‘Umar Al-Mazini, who is not known, as it says in Al-Lisan.” (Silsilah Al-AHadith Ad-Da`ifah wa Al-Mawdu`ah, 11/191, no. 5112)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Hadith is also classed as inauthentic in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Daimah, 3/141.</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/6653\" target=\"_blank\">6653</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7699\" target=\"_blank\">7699</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9211\" target=\"_blank\">9211</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13692\" target=\"_blank\">13692</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on registering with a group that will stay overnight outside of Mina",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on staying with the groups that go for Hajj and their tents are in Muzdalifah, outside the boundaries of Mina? Are these tents an extension of Mina or not? Is there anything wrong with going with these groups? Does that affect the validity of one’s Hajj at all?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Staying overnight in Mina on the night before the eleventh     and twelfth of Dhu’l-Hijjah is obligatory according to the majority of     scholars, and the one who fails to do it without an excuse has to offer a     sacrifice of a sheep, to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed     to the poor of the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a person cannot find any room in Mina, he should stay     where the tents end, even if it is in Muzdalifah, because Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you     can”</p>\n<p>    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]</p>\n<p>    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was     asked about a person who did Hajj and stayed outside of Mina: what does he     have to do? What are the guidelines about staying overnight in Mina?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: If a person cannot find any room in Mina, he     should stay where the tents end. But if he can find room (in Mina) then he     must stay there overnight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The guidelines about staying overnight are that he should be     in Mina for most of the night. But if he leaves Mina, for example to do     tawaaf al-ifaadah at the beginning of the night, then he is not able to go     back before dawn because of the crowds, there is no sin on him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is obligatory     to look for a place in Mina before he decides to stay in Muzdalifah. If he     cannot find a place (in Mina) then he may go to Muzdalifah and stay there.     He does not have to go to Mina and spend most of the night driving around,     or looking for a spot on the roadside among the vehicles, because that may     put him in danger. We say: If you cannot find a place in Mina, then stay in     Muzdalifah, where the tents end, and you do not have to do anything so long     as you looked for a place but did not find any, because Allaah does not     burden any soul beyond its scope. End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn     ‘Uthaymeen (23/240, 241).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If the     pilgrim tries hard to look for a place in Mina to spend the night there, but     he does not find any, there is no sin on him if he stays outside of it, and     he does not have to offer any fidyah, because of the general meaning of the     words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you     can”</p>\n<p>    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]</p>\n<p>    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon     him) said: “If I enjoin you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.”     &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (16/149).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, he must register with a group that will spend     the night in Mina, or he may register with a group that will spend the night     in Muzdalifah, but he should have the intention of looking for a place in     Mina. If he finds a place he must stay there for half the night, but if he     does not find a place there is no sin on him if he stays in Muzdalifah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it valid to retract a vow?",
      "question": "<p>I am a student and I asked Allah to let me get first place in my class, and I vowed that if I achieved that, I would fast on a specific day, which is Thursday. Before I started the second half of the year, before the results were known, I found out that the school would announce who was first in the school, not in each class, so I retracted my vow. Now I would fast on the same Thursday if I got first place in the school, not in the class. <br />\nThe results came out and I got second place in the school, and first place in the class. Hence I did not fast on that day, because I did not get first place in the school.  <br />\nAm I sinning in this case? What should I do?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Your vow that if you got first place in your class, you would fast that Thursday, is an act of worship that must be fulfilled when the condition for it is met. As you came first in your class, you have to fast for a day as you vowed to do, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to obey Allah, let him obey Him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6318).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not acceptable to retract a vow, because of what we have stated above about it being obligatory to fulfil it, and because ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Four things are binding in every case: manumission, divorce, marriage, and vows.” Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf (4/82). And it was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “There are four that cannot be retracted and must be fulfilled: marriage, divorce, manumission and vows.” This was quoted by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (8/197).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (7/267).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your second vow has to do with the placing in the school; you do not have to do anything because the condition was not fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, if you vowed that you would fast on any Thursday, then you must fulfil the vow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you vowed that you would fast a specific Thursday and it has passed, then you have to make up this day and fast on another Thursday, and you also have to offer expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen), because you did not fast on the day that you specified for fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (28/212):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he vowed to fast a certain month and he did not fast it with no excuse, then he has to make it up and also offer expiation for breaking an oath – and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point. If he did not fast it due to an excuse, then he has to make it up – and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point – but there are two opinions narrated from Imam Ahmad with regard to expiation. Our view is that he also has to offer expiation, and this was regarded as the correct opinion by Ibn Qudaamah and others. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should note that making vows is makrooh, although it is obligatory to fulfil them, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6608) and Muslim (1639) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told people not to make vows and said: “They do not avert anything, all they do is get something out of a stingy person.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

(al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i)</p>\n<p>When he had finished reciting Quran, he would pause for a moment then raise his hands, say takbeer and do rukoo’.</p>\n<p>(Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 128).</p>\n<p>He used to raise his hands when he stood up from rukoo’</p>\n<p>(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and this raising of the hands is mutawaatir (reported by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). It is the opinion of the majority of scholars and of some of the Hanafis. (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by al-Albaani, p. 136).</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say takbeer when he got up for the third rak’ah</p>\n<p>(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and he would raise his hands sometimes when he said this takbeer.

And in the time of the Sahaabah, if ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar saw someone not raising his hands in prayer, he would throw a stone at him. [next phrase is unclear].</p>\n<p>(I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/376).</p>\n<p>So what is proven in the Sunnah with regard to raising the hands in prayer is that they should be raised at four points in the prayer: when pronouncing takbeerat al-ihram, when doing rukoo’, when standing up from rukoo’, and after standing up from the first tashahhud.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He owes money and wants to pay it off with haraam wealth",
      "question": "<p>I am a mother of four sons, spending on their maintenance. Three years ago, I lent someone a large amount of money, giving him some money every now and then, on the basis that he would return the money one year later. Three years have gone by, and I have asked him to pay me back any sum of money, even in monthly instalments. Now he is saying to me that he does not have anything left over of his salary from the company, because of his responsibilities and commitments, but if I want haraam wealth, then he can pay me back the money that I lent him within one month, but it will be from haraam wealth; I will be accountable for this haraam wealth before Allah, may He be exalted, and he will have discharged his obligation before Allah, may He be exalted, and will be free of the sin of this haraam wealth. Should I take back my money from him and accept this haraam wealth, because I have been waiting for three years and he has not paid me back my money, even by monthly instalments?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Haraam wealth is of two types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is haraam in and of itself, which is wealth that is taken without consent, such as wealth that is stolen, seized by force or plundered. This is haraam to the one who takes it, and to the one to whom it is passed on, if the latter is aware of the situation, because the prohibition concerning it has to do with the wealth itself, because it is the property of the one who was wronged and must be returned to him. As for making use of it and benefiting from it, that is sharing in the wrongdoing and sin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if the wealth is haraam in and of itself, it is not permissible for him to pay off the debt with it, and it is not permissible for you to accept it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That which is haraam because of the manner in which it was acquired. This is wealth that is taken with consent in return for a haraam action, or by means of a haraam business deal, such as the fee of a singer or musician, or money resulting from riba-based transactions, such as bribes and interest, money paid for alcohol or drugs, and the like.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This wealth is haraam only for the one who acquires it, according to some scholars, and it is not haraam for the one to whom it is passed on by permissible means, such as a gift or maintenance.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/289442\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">289442</a>.</p>\n<p>If the one who acquired this wealth has repented, and is in need, it is permissible for him to take from it as much as he needs, and it is permissible for him to pay off his debt with it.</p>\n<p>Based on that, if the debtor does not own anything except this haraam wealth, there is nothing wrong with him paying off his debt with it, and there is no blame on you for accepting that.</p>\n<p>What appears to be the case from the question is that he does not currently possess this haraam wealth; rather he wants to commit sin in order to pay off his debts. If that is the case, according to what we understand, then it is not permissible for him to do that, and it is not permissible for you to call on him to do that. Rather you must give him more time, if he is indeed in financial difficulty, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease” [al-Baqarah 2:280].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One of the things we learn from this verse is that it is obligatory to give one who is in difficulty more time, until he becomes well-off, because Allah, may He be exalted, says: “then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease.” So it is not permissible to demand that he pay off the debt or to ask him for what is owed.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah (3/391).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>My problem is with my father i have 7 brothers and i am number 5 and i asked my father that i want to marry and his answer was no wait 4 years and i am going to finish my trainnig in shallah after 1 year and maybe you know how is my country it is really not good ALLAH AL MODTA3AAN so i want to know is my father going to have thnoooob coz he didn't let me marry and my all brothers are singles not marry and i cant talk to him any more coz when i talk to him he gets angry and i cant say anything that time and really i didn't do any thing bad  wallah i want to do everything in the right way but he don't allow me to do it</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We noticed in your question that you are kind to your father,     and this is something to be commended. We urge you to keep honouring your     father, for Allaah has enjoined that upon you, and the texts which enjoin     that are so well known that we do not need to quote them here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We also noticed from your question how hard you are trying     not to fall into doing something that would lead to doom and punishment.     This indicates – in sha Allaah – that your religious commitment is strong.     Your religious commitment is your capital, so beware of squandering it and     losing out in this world and in the Hereafter. Keep this fear of falling     into immoral actions which would earn you the wrath of Allaah. Always     remember that Allaah is watching you, night and day, and remember that He     knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden; He knows the fraud of     the eyes, and all that the hearts conceal. It is sufficient to imagine if     Allaah were to take your soul whilst you – Allaah forbid – were committing a     sin: how would you meet Allaah?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;We advise you to fear Allaah, for that will form a barrier     between you and immoral actions. We advise you to lower you gaze and avoid     looking at anything that Allaah has forbidden. You are only allowed the     first glance which happens unintentionally. We advise you not to listen to     things that Allaah has forbidden that may provoke desire, and to keep away     from bad company and immoral friends who do not want anything for you except     Hell in the Hereafter and shame in this world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    These are some of the things that make a person fall into     immoral actions. The more you keep away from them, the more you will keep     away from immorality. After that, we advise you to do acts of worship,     especially fasting, which is the remedy recommended by the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in cases such as yours. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with     him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)     said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do     so, and whoever cannot, then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.”</p>\n<p>    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4778; Muslim, 1400)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We advise you to read Qur’aan and to make a lot of du’aa’,     asking Allaah to keep you away from temptations both obvious and hidden. We     advise you to find good friends who can guide you to the path of     righteousness and help you to adhere to it. We also advise you to exercise,     and to go to sleep early.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some of the means which, hopefully, will be the     means of keeping you away from everything that is not pleasing to your     Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We offer you the following useful advice:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Muflih said – quoting from Ibn ‘Aqeel in al-Funoon     – You listen to the words “Tell the believing men     to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things)” [al-Noor 24:30 –     interpretation of the meaning], but you are     staring at that which Allaah has forbidden as if you are desperate to     acquire it or regretting that you have no way to get it. And you listen to     the words, “Some faces that Day shall be Naadirah (shining and radiant)”     [al-Qiyaamah 75:22 – interpretation of the meaning] and you think that     they were revealed concerning you. And you listen to the words “And some     faces that Day will be Baasirah (dark, gloomy, frowning and sad)”     [al-Qiyaamah 75:24 – interpretation of the meaning], and you think that     they were revealed concerning someone else! How can you be so sure? Where     did this wishful thinking come from? This is a kind of deception which     stands between you and taqwa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/151, 152)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to what your father is doing, preventing you from     getting married and delaying your marriage, this is a mistake on his part.     He should fear Allaah with regard to his sons, and hasten to arrange their     marriages. He should realize that the need of some of his sons and daughters     for marriage may be greater than their need for food and drink.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There follows a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah     have mercy on him) on a case that was similar to your father’s:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “As Allaah has enjoined upon your father to spend on your     food, drink, clothing and accommodation, he must also arrange your marriage     if you need to get married, as the scholars have said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    I would like to take this opportunity to point out something     important, which is that some fathers, even though they are well-off, refuse     to arrange their sons’ marriages when the sons ask them to, telling them,     ‘Earn enough money to spend on yourself and get married, for you are a man,’     and so on. But the scholars have stated that whoever is obliged to spend on     a person is also obliged to keep him chaste and arrange his marriage. So let     these fathers fear Allaah and do that which Allaah has enjoined upon them,     namely keeping their sons chaste. And Allaah is the Source of strength.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From Fataawa Manaar al-Islam, part 3, p. 619&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Finally, we ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast and     chaste, and to help us, for He is the Best of supporters and helpers.</p>\n",

      "title": "First and second stages of exiting ihram",
      "question": "<p>When does the pilgrim exit ihram?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly: the actions of the Day of Sacrifice are three for the pilgrim who is doing Ifraad. They are: stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, shaving the head or cutting the hair, and tawaf al-ifaadah, plus Sa`i if he&nbsp; did not do it after the tawaf of arrival. For those who are doing Tamattu’ or Qiraan, they must also slaughter the sacrifice. The one who is doing tamattu’ must also do Sa`i after tawaf al-ifaadah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: these actions should be done in the following order: stoning the Jamrah, then offering the sacrifice, then shaving the head or cutting the hair, then tawaf and Sa`i. This is best, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he stoned the Jamrah, then offered the sacrifice, then shaved his head, then ‘Aa’ishah put perfume on him, then he went to the Ka’bah (to do tawaf al-ifaadah). He was asked about the order in which these actions were to be done, by those who had done some of them ahead of others, and he said: “It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly: Whoever does two of them apart from offering the sacrifice has thus completed the first stage of exiting ihram, hence it becomes permissible for him to do all the things that were forbidden to him whilst in ihram, apart&nbsp; from intercourse. When he has done all three, then everything that was forbidden to him become permissible, including intercourse. There are many ahaadeeth concerning this which point to this meaning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.
