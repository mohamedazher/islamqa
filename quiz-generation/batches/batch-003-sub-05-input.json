      "title": "Does chatting between the sexes on social media sites come under the heading of khulwah that is forbidden?",
      "question": "<p>Does chatting between the sexes on social media sites come under the heading of khulwah that is forbidden?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No man should be alone with a woman unless there is a mahram present.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5233) and Muslim (1341).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;What is meant by khulwah in this hadith is physically being alone together.</p>\n<p>The reason for this prohibition is that it is thought that this khulwah will lead to falling into what is prohibited (haraam), because it enables the Shaytaan to instill such temptation. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) referred to that when he said: “Indeed, no man is alone with a woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2165); he said: This is a hasan saheeh ghareeb hadith with this isnad. al-Haakim said in al-Mustadrak (1/114): It is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim], and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel (6/215).</p>\n<p>Al-Minnaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“but the Shaytaan is the third one present” by means of his waswasah (whispers), stirring up of desire, dispelling of modesty, and encouragement to commit sin, until he tempts them to commit the act of intercourse or that which is less than it of precursors that will soon lead to it. This hadith proves that it (khulwah) is haraam.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer (3/78).</p>\n<p>The prohibition on being alone with a non-mahram woman comes under the heading of barring ways that lead to shameful deeds. This is one of the fundamental principles of our religious teaching.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that anything that is a means that leads to fitnah (temptation) is not permissible, because the means that lead to mischief must be barred, if that is not outweighed by a greater interest.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (15/419).</p>\n<p>If a man talks to a non-mahram woman in a private chat on social media websites – even if it does not come under the heading of the khulwah discussed by the fuqaha’ – this is still a means that leads to fitnah (temptation) and mischief, so it is disallowed for that reason.</p>\n<p>If looking, shaking hands and the like are forbidden, so as to block the means of being tempted by the woman, even if there is no khulwah, then disallowing private conversation, especially among young people and those who are thought most likely to be vulnerable to temptation, also comes under that heading.</p>\n<p>There are many religious texts which forbid seeking enjoyment in talking to a non-mahram woman and finding pleasure in listening to her voice and looking at her; this is regarded as a type of zina.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that “Allah has decreed for the son of Adam his share of zina, which he will inevitably get. The zina of the eyes is looking and the zina of the tongue is speaking. The heart wishes and hopes, and the private part confirms that or denies it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6243), Muslim (2657). Ahmad (27430) added: “And the zina of the ears is listening.”</p>\n<p>With some people, the matter may go as far as the Shaytaan tempting them to the extent that they take off their clothes for one another (exchanging nude photos etc).</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the Shaytaan has many traps into which people fall, such as mischief, desires and temptations. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left behind me among the people any fitnah (trial) that is more harmful to men than women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5096) and Muslim (2741).</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe”</p>\n<p>[al-A‘raaf 7:27].</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>So Allah has forbidden the children of Adam to be tempted by the temptation of the Shaytaan, as their parents were tempted, by disobeying Allah and obeying the Shaytaan in going against the commands and prohibitions of Allah.</p>\n<p>He stripped&nbsp; the parents of their clothing, and in like manner he may strip their offspring of the garment of piety (taqwa) and their physical garments, so that they show their private parts.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Istiqaamah (2/170).</p>\n<p>To sum up, for a man to chat with a non-mahram woman on social media websites, in a chat room away from other visitors and subscribers, does not come under the heading of the khulwah that is forbidden,</p>\n<p>But it is disallowed because of what it involves of temptation and the likelihood of mischief.</p>\n<p>So Muslim men and women should avoid such contact, unless it is for a greater religious purpose, such as asking questions of scholars, or it is for a legitimate worldly purpose, in which case the conversation should be only as much as is needed, without unnecessary chitchat and going off topic.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Who are the siddeeqoon? What are their characteristics?",
      "question": "<p>Who are the siddeeqoon [the strong and true in faith, or the first and foremost to believe] according to the Qur’an and Sunnah? What are their characteristics and virtues? How can a person become one of them?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>High ambition, sublime aims and the desire to attain high status and draw closer to Allah by doing righteous deeds and refraining from that which is forbidden are all things that are prescribed and encouraged in Islam. Al-Bukhaari (7423) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws, for it is the middle of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise; above it is the Throne of the Most Gracious, and from it flow the rivers of Paradise.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with the Muslim praying to be among the righteous close friends of Allah, or the sincere siddeeqoon.</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The close friends of Allah, may He be exalted, are the pious ones among His creation who fear Him. Everyone who is pious is a close friend of Allah, but that close friendship varies according to the level of a person’s faith and piety or fear of Allah. The highest status thereof after that of the Prophets is the status of the siddeeqoon; those who attain this status are the siddeeqoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And whoso obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!”&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:69]</p>\n<p>“And those who believe in (the Oneness of) Allah and His Messengers, they are the Siddeeqoon (i.e. those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them), and the martyrs with their Lord, they shall have their reward and their light”&nbsp;[al-Hadeed 57:19].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Khaazin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The siddeeq (explained here as one of “those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them” is the one who speaks the truth. The siddeeqoon are those followers of the Messengers who followed their path after they were gone, until they met them. And it was said that the siddeeq is the one who believes in the entire religion, to the extent that he has no doubt at all about his faith.\"(Tafseer al-Khaazin&nbsp; 1/397)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The word siddeeq is a grammatically intensive form which indicates a high level of belief. The siddeeq is the one who confirms with his actions what he says with his tongue. And it was said that they (the siddeeqoon) are the best of the followers of the Prophets who were the first of them to believe, such as Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi 5/272)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The siddeeqoon are those who reached the highest levels of faith, righteous deeds, beneficial knowledge and true certainty.\"(Tafseer as-Sa‘di&nbsp; p. 841)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The highest level of sincerity is that of the siddeeq; it is perfect submission to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), accompanied by perfect sincerity towards the One Who sent him.\"(Madaarij as-Saalikeen&nbsp; 2/258)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2424\" target=\"_blank\">2424</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever follows the Siddeeqoon in their path of sincerity, belief, piety and righteousness will be one of them and will be gathered with them (on the Day of Resurrection). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And whoso obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!”&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:69].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever wants to strive to reach this status and for Allah to bestow it upon him, and to be one of its people, must have perfect sincerity in word and deed, and fear Allah privately and in public.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/107283\" target=\"_blank\">107283</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She said to her husband: You are haraam to me until the Day of Judgement",
      "question": "<p>A woman swore an oath to her husband and said to him: You are haraam to me until the Day of Judgement. What is the religious ruling on that? What is required to get out of her oath? Will she be brought to account for that?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a wife says to her     husband, You are haraam for me, or you are haraam until the Day of     Judgement, that does not result in zihaar or talaaq, because zihaar and     talaaq can only be done by the husband. Rather it comes under the heading of     making what is halaal haraam, such as stating that some kind of clothing or     food is haraam. When breaking this oath she must offer expiation for     breaking an oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Prophet! Why do you     forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to you, seeking to     please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;Allaah has already     ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths”</p>\n<p>[al-Tahreem 66:1-2]</p>\n<p>So Allaah has described     making haraam something that is halaal as a kind of oath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The expiation for breaking     an oath is freeing a slave, or feeding or clothing ten poor persons. The one     who cannot do any of these things must fast three days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She only breaks the oath if     her husband has intercourse with her when she is willing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah     have mercy on him) was asked: If a woman says to her husband, If you do such     and such you are haraam for me like my father, what is the ruling on that?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied: If a woman says     she is haraam for her husband or she likens him to one of her mahrams, that     comes under the same ruling as an oath, and does not come under the ruling     on zihaar, because zihaar can only be done by husbands to wives according to     the text of the Qur’aan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In that case the woman must     offer expiation for breaking an oath, which is to feed ten poor persons,     giving each poor person half a saa’ of the local staple food, which is     equivalent to approximately one and a half kilograms, giving them either     lunch or dinner; or clothing them in garments that are acceptable for     praying in, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allaah will not punish     you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your     deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen     (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your     own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford     (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the     oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa'idah 5:89].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman makes haraam     that which Allaah has permitted, it comes under the same ruling as an oath.     The same applies to a man making haraam that which Allaah has forbidden,     except his wife, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“O Prophet! Why do you     forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to you, seeking to     please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;Allaah has already     ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And Allaah is your     Mawlaa (Lord, or Master, or Protector) and He is the All‑Knower, the     All‑Wise”</p>\n<p>[al-Tahreem 66:1-2]</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa     Islamiyyah (3/301).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wife must repent to     Allaah for saying this, because making haraam what is halaal is not     permissible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should he cancel the investment certificates after a fatwa was issued stating that it is prohibited to invest in them? And what is the ruling on previous profit?",
      "question": "<p>I used to deduct a portion of profits from the Islamic bank where I put my money, in order to avoid dubious transactions that could be subject to error. Then the fatwa concerning that changed, which meant that I should put my money in a current account. 1.. What is the ruling on what remains of these profits that were previously given to me? Do I have to calculate what I earned in the past and give it to the needy, with the aim of getting rid of it, or should I do that from the date that I came to know of the change in the fatwa? 2.. What should I do with the investment certificates? Should I wait until they expire and not renew them? Or should I cancel them immediately, and bear the resulting losses for not completing the stated period?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If the Islamic bank put some of its money into bonds or riba-based treasury bills, or it invests the money in organized tawarruq [a trick whereby the bank pays for an item on behalf of a customer, then asks the customer to pay back more than the original price, to be paid in instalments. The customer then sells the item himself, or asks the bank to sell it on his behalf, in order to obtain cash], it is not permissible to invest money in it, because according to the investment contract, the bank is representing itself and acting as a proxy for the investors, so the sin of the haraam transactions it is doing will also be on them, and the sin is not waived from them by getting rid of the haraam interest.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Regarding the riba-based interest that you received <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2492\" target=\"_blank\">before coming to know of the prohibition</a> , you may make use of it, whether you spent it already or you still have it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding riba (interpretation of the meaning): <em>{</em><em>But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past</em><em>} [al-Baqarah 2:275]</em>.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What there is no doubt about, in our view, is that whatever he received on the basis of a misunderstanding or ignorance, he may keep what is past, without a doubt, as is indicated by the Qur’an and Sunnah and the correct scholarly view.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Tafseer Aayaat ashkalat ‘ala Katheer min al-‘Ulama’</em> (2/592).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he was not aware that this is prohibited, he may keep everything that he acquired, and he does not have to do anything; or if he was confused by a fatwa issued by a scholar which stated that it is not prohibited, he does not have to pay anything. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {<em>So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah</em><em>} [al-Baqarah 2:275]</em>.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri</em> (67/19).</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we learn from the verse is that whatever a person receives of ribe (interest) before coming to know of the prohibition is permissible for him, on condition that he repents and stops engaging in that transaction.&nbsp;End quote from <em>Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah</em> (3/377).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>You must stop investing in this bank, whether that is through an investment account or through limited-time certificates, even if that results in losing some money, so as to flee from dealing with riba and in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p><em>{</em><em>O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.</em></p>\n<p><em>And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged}&nbsp;[</em><em>al-Baqarah 2:278-279]</em>.</p>\n<p>And Muslim narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

(See also Fath Al-Bari by Ibn Rajab, 2/104)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/84314\" target=\"_blank\">On the night of the Isra’</a> , one and a half years before the Hijrah, Allah enjoined upon His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the five daily prayers, and explained that there were conditions and essential parts and other matters having to do with them, bit by bit.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7/164)</p>\n<p>Then Jibril (peace be upon him) came down and taught the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9940\" target=\"_blank\">the times of the prayers</a> :&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (522) and Muslim (611) narrated from Ibn Shihab that `Umar ibn `Abd Al-`Aziz delayed the prayer one day. `Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr entered upon him and told him that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah delayed the prayer one day when he was in Kufah, and Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari entered upon him and said: What is this, O Mughirah? Do you not know that Jibril came down and prayed, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed, then he prayed and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed. Then he said: This is what has been enjoined upon me. `Umar said to `Urwah: Think what you are narrating, O `Urwah! Is Jibril the one who taught the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1092\" target=\"_blank\">the times of the prayers?</a> `Urwah said: That is what Bashir ibn Abi Mas`ud used to narrate from his father.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nasa’i (526) narrated that Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Jibril (peace be upon him) came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when the sun had passed its zenith and said: Get up, O Muhammad. That was when the sun had passed the meridian. Then he waited until the (length of) a man’s shadow was equal to his height, then he came to him for `Asr and said: Get up, O Muhammad, and pray `Asr. Then he waited until the sun set, then he came to him and said: Get up and pray Maghrib. So he got up and prayed it when the sun had set fully. Then he waited until the twilight had disappeared, then he came and said: Get up and pray `Isha’, so he got up and prayed it… In this Hadith it says: He (i.e., Jibril) said: The period between two of these two times is the time to pray. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>`Abd Ar-Razzaq narrated in his Musannaf (1773) and Ibn Ishaq narrated in his Sirah – as it says in Fath Al-Bari (2/286) – that this happened on the morning after the night in which prayer was made obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“(The scholars) did not differ concerning the fact that Jibril (peace be upon him) came down on the morning following the night of the Isra’, when the sun passed its zenith, and taught the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the prayer and its timings.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Jibril’s explanation of the timings of the prayer came on the morning following the night of the Isra’.” (Sharh Al-`Umdah, 4/148)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the five daily prayers were first made obligatory, each prayer was two rak`ahs, then after the Hijrah, that was confirmed in the case of travel, and two rak`ahs were added for those who are not travelling, except Maghrib, which remained as it was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (3935) and Muslim (685) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Prayer was enjoined with two Rak`ahs, then when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) migrated, it was enjoined with four Rak`ahs, but prayer whilst travelling remained as it had originally been.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_did_the_Muslims_pray_before_prayer_was_made_obligatory\"><strong>How did the Muslims pray before prayer was made obligatory?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions used to pray before the five daily prayers were made obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (27/52-53):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12305\" target=\"_blank\">Prayer</a> was originally enjoined in Makkah at the beginning of Islam, because there are Makkan verses that were revealed at the beginning of the Prophet’s mission that encourage praying. As for the five daily prayers in the form that is well-known, they were made obligatory <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/203789\" target=\"_blank\">on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj</a> .”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars are of the view that prayer was made obligatory at the beginning, two Rak`ahs in the morning and two Rak`ahs in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fath:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“A number of scholars are of the view that before the Isra’ there was no obligatory prescribed prayer, but prayers were offered at night, without any number of Rak`ahs being specified. Al-Harbi was of the view that prayer was made obligatory, two rak`ahs in the morning and two rak`ahs in the afternoon. Ash-Shafi`i narrated from some of the scholars that prayer at night was obligatory, then it was abrogated by the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {So, recite you of the Quran as much as may be easy for you} [Al-Muzammil 73:20]. So it became obligatory to pray for part of the night. Then that was abrogated by the five daily prayers.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Before the Isra’, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) definitely used to pray, as did his Companions, but there is a scholarly difference of opinion as to whether any kind of prayer was made obligatory before the five daily prayers or not. It was said that what was obligatory at first was prayer before sunrise and prayer before sunset. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting} [Ta-Ha 20:130], and similar verses.” (See also Tafsir Ibn `Atiyyah (1/204); At-Tahrir wat Tanwir by Ibn `Ashur (24/75)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

I was wondering if you have the time to email me personally and just help through this?<br />\n<br />\nPlease, please, please get back to me.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There are some preliminaries that we should talk to you     about, and we hope that you will pay attention to what we say to you:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1.</p>\n<p>    We recognize that you are living in a country that is     permissive in moral terms, in which things are allowed that are forbidden in     Islam, and things have reached a state where they -- both males and females     -- ride bicycles in the street in front of people when they are virtually     naked. People are undoubtedly affected by their environment, hence there is     a stern warning against settling among the mushrikeen and those who are     morally bankrupt. We think that if you were living in a decent, conservative     environment, you would not be feeling this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2.</p>\n<p>    We are sorry to see that in your question that you went     beyond asking questions in seeking to understand, to the extent of impugning     the laws and wisdom of Allah, and differentiating between faith in Allah,     may He be exalted, and the laws of Islam. The laws of Islam came from Allah     in the first place; they come from Him and from nowhere else. So it is     better to phrase such objections in the form of questions that are aimed at     removing doubt, and not in this style or form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    3.</p>\n<p>    You have mixed up the rulings of Islam and the actions of     Muslims. The laws of Islam are pure and were prescribed by Allah, may He be     exalted, to set straight the affairs of people and countries. Whatever the     Muslims do that is contrary to the laws of their Lord can only be attributed     to them, not to their religion. The religion of Allah does not permit males     to drink alcohol or to make friends with non-mahram women or to commit zina     (fornication or adultery). How can you attribute these evil deeds and major     sins that are committed by the misguided youth to the laws of Allah, and     claim that He permits that to them [males] and forbids them to females? You     are mistaken and confused. You have made a mistake by attributing their     actions to Islam and you are confused in your belief that these actions are     permissible for males and not females.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You said some objectionable words in your question, which are     very wrong and pose a danger to your religious commitment, so you have to     repent from them and regret them. Among the worst of them are your words,     “why do people say that Islam is the greatest religion on earth if it’s so     unfair and cruel?” These are words which, if they were spoken by one who     understood their meanings, they would be tantamount to apostasy in his case.     They imply impugning of Allah, may He be exalted, which is a serious matter.     Perhaps your excuse is that you were confused between the laws of Allah and     the actions of some Muslims. Islam is the religion of Allah and it is what     He has prescribed. It is what He revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings     and peace of Allah upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Truly, the religion with Allaah is Islam”</p>\n<p>    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:19]</p>\n<p>    “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will     never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”</p>\n<p>    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Accusing Islam of being unjust and cruel is one of the     falsest of falsehoods. Allah says, negating the first accusation     (interpretation of the meaning): </p>\n<p>    “Verily, Allaah enjoins Al‑‘Adl (i.e. justice and     worshipping none but Allaah Alone — Islamic Monotheism) and Al‑Ihsân [i.e.     to be patient in performing your duties to Allaah, totally for Allaah’s sake     and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet    صلىالله عليه وسلم in a perfect manner],     and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allaah has ordered you to     give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of     help), and forbids Al‑Fahshâ’ (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual     acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false     witness, to kill a life without right), and Al‑Munkar (i.e. all that is     prohibited by Islamic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every     kind of evil deeds), and Al‑Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He     admonishes you, that you may take heed”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nahl 16:90].</p>\n<p>    And He says, negating the second accusation:</p>\n<p>    “Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make     things difficult for you”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:185].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?”</p>\n<p>    [Yoonus 10:32].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Messenger of Allah (sa) said: “Allaah did not send me to     make things hard for people in the hope that they would make mistakes,     rather He sent me to teach and make things easy.” Narrated by Muslim, 1478.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with     him) said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (sa): Which religion is     most beloved to Allah? He said: “al-Haneefiyyah al-Samhah (easy     monotheism).” Narrated by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The basic principle with regard to the commands and     prohibitions is that there is no differentiation between males and females     with regard to them. There is no need to point out that this applies to all     rulings, but we find that in the case of some prohibitions, Allah mentions     both sexes, and this confirms what we say, which is that there is basically     no difference between the sexes, especially with regard to things that are     forbidden in Islam. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (i)</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off     (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which     they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah. And Allaah is     All‑Powerful, All‑Wise”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:38].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (ii)</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning):</p>\n<p>    “The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them     with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a     punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day.     And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.”</p>\n<p>    [al-Noor 24:2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    (iii)</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking     at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual     acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do.</p>\n<p>    31.&nbsp;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from     looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal     sexual acts)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Noor 24:30. 31].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, we should tell you that there are some things that     are forbidden for men but permissible for women, because they are     appropriate for women’s nature but arenot appropriate for men. It was     narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah,     may He be glorified and exalted, has permitted silk and gold to the females     of my ummah, and has forbidden them to the males.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Ahmad (19184) and al-Nasaa’i (5265); classed as     saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We should also tell you that the differences in the physical     makeup of both genders may dictate variation in some rulings, but in the     context of reward and status with Allah, this variation becomes     insignificant and each person will be rewarded in accordance with his effort     and his situation; no one will be wronged and no deed will be undervalued;     no one will be brought to account for something they did not do. Allah, may     He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female,     and is a (true) believer [in the Oneness of Allaah (Muslim)], such will     enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a Naqeera     (speck on the back of a date stone), will be done to them”</p>\n<p>    [al-Nisa’ 4:124]</p>\n<p>    “Whosoever does an evil deed, will not be requited except     the like thereof; and whosoever does a righteous deed, whether male or     female and is a true believer (in the Oneness of Allaah), such will enter     Paradise, where they will be provided therein (with all things in abundance)     without limit”</p>\n<p>    [Ghaafir 40:60].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is this sufficient for you to realise how wrong you are in     thinking that haraam things are permissible for males and not females? From     this you will realise that your saying “why is it okay for a boy to go out     and get so drunk he can’t walk properly and sleep with a million different     girls?” has no basis in truth. Alcohol and zina (fornication) are major sins     and no differentiation is made with regard to them between males and     females; both of them -- if they do these things -- incur the burden of sin     and deserve the prescribed punishment. If many people differentiate in this     matter by allowing their sons to do this but not their daughters, that is     due to the temptation of the Shaytaan and does not stem from the laws of the     Most Merciful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is there any reason or wisdom, is there any justice or     fairness in anything if you regard the deeds of evildoers and immoral people     and the filth of addicts and fornicators as the criteria to judge the     religion of the Lord of the Worlds??&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your saying, “some Muslims seem to think it’s okay to marry a     fifteen-year-old girl to some thirty-year-old man she's never met before,     why is that okay?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    These words are unfair and contrary to the reality that you     want to judge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please take note of what we are going to tell you:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1. </p>\n<p>    A marriage can never take place between a thirty-year-old man     and a fifteen year old girl, between that girl and a man of whatever age she     wants, except with her agreement. What harm will it do you if a man of that     age proposes marriage to you when you are at the age you are at, then you     accept it and want to marry him, and you tell your guardian to go ahead with     that? What if she is thirty years old and he is forty-five? So what? The     fact that she did not accept this husband before does not mean anything. The     matter is for her to decide, if she wants that and agrees to it after asking     about him and making enquiries about him; and if she wants she can reject     him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2. </p>\n<p>    Moreover, if she has met him before -- as happens among those     who act contrary to sharee‘ah and have haraam relationships -- that does not     mean that their marriage will be happy; rather most of what you hear about     husbands beating their wives, wives killing their husbands, divorce,     separation and marital infidelity -- all of that, in the society in which     you are living and others like it -- happens between spouses who knew one     another and met one another before marriage, and in many cases had a child     or children. Did that meeting before marriage benefit them at all?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2.</p>\n<p>    As a thirty-year-old man can marry a fifteen-year-old girl,     so too a man of twenty can marry a woman of thirty or even forty. So what?     What matters is the fact that both agree and consent to the marriage. What     harm does it do if there is a difference in age between the spouses? Is     there any marriage that was happier than the marriages of the Prophet     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Khadeejah and ‘Aa’ishah? His     marriage to Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her) took place when she     was nearly twice his age, and his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah took place when he     was much older than her, but they were among the most successful of     marriages on earth. So when did the difference in ages between the spouses     in and of itself have a negative impact on the marriage?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fifthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Your saying “Why is it that when a Muslim girl strikes out on     her own and wants to do something with her life she can’t because Islam is     holding her back?” is not correct, because Islam does not prevent a woman     from going out on her own to the mosque or to the marketplace or to the     houses of her family, relatives and neighbours. Rather what is forbidden is     for her to travel on her own without a mahram, and the accompaniment of a     mahram when travelling is only prescribed in order to protect her from those     who would mess with her and cause her harm. Perhaps you see in the country     in which you live that women are not safe if they go out alone to the     marketplace or to work, and they are aware that the “wolves” of the streets     are waiting for them. When Islam prescribes something that is aimed at     protecting women, that is not mistreatment of them; rather it is because     Islam holds them in high esteem and shows great respect to them, as well as     paying attention to their weakness and their need for someone else who will     protect and guard them against evildoers who would do them harm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, every wise person realises that women need     protection and care more then men, and the need to protect girls against     going astray or falling victim to aggression is even greater. If she loses     her virginity or becomes pregnant or her honour is physically tarnished,     that may affect her and her future, and it may be difficult for her to     conceal it. As for boys, there is no differentiation between a boy and girl     with regard to the shar‘i punishment in this world or the recompense in the     Hereafter, but a boy -- at least -- can conceal his misdemeanour, and its     effect and shame are not apparent in his case. Moreover, he is not the one     for whom aggression is feared; he is the one who is the aggressor and the     girl is the target and victim. So which of them is more deserving of being     protected, guarded, watched over and cared for? “if you but knew” [Nooh     71:4].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sixthly:</p>\n<p>    As for your saying “why is it not okay for a Muslim woman to     marry a non-Muslim man when she's fallen in love with him but it's perfectly     fine for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim lady?”, this is a very strange     comment! Can these be the words of one who believes in Allah, may He be     exalted, as her Lord and describes herself as a Muslim? Where is the faith     in the name of Allah al-Hakam (the Most Wise), and where is the belief in     your Lord’s attribute of wisdom? Where is the submission to His commands and     prohibitions? Now you want any Muslim woman who falls in love with a     Buddhist or Hindu man to be able to marry him! Do you believe that Islam     allows men to marry female idolaters, Communists or Buddhists? This is a     mistaken notion. It is not permissible for Muslim men to marry kaafir women,     except those who are Jews or Christians; it is not permissible for them to     marry women of any other religions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the case of a Muslim woman, it is haraam for her to marry     anyone of any other religion apart from Islam. This is a matter on which     there is scholarly consensus and there are no differences concerning that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is very strange that you want a Muslim woman be able to     marry any kaafir she falls in love with, whilst many kaafirs do not allow     their daughters to marry Muslim men even if they fall in love with them!     Buddhists and Hindus do not give their daughters in marriage to Muslims.     Indeed there are some Christian denominations who do not marry one another!     How did it occur to you that Islam does not take care of Muslim women and     allows them to marry men of any religion, so that could lead to them being     driven away from their religion?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please see the answer to question number    <a href=\"/en/answers/83736\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">83736</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Seventhly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to your saying “why do the men get to choose who     they want to marry but sometimes woman gets no say in it at all? Why is it     so unfair?” your mistake is very clear and obvious. In fact the woman may     choose just as the man may choose; in fact her right to choose is greater     than his. The woman who receives marriage proposals can choose whoever she     wants and reject all the others. In fact she may choose a man who suits her,     whereas it may not be easy for a man to propose to more than one or two. All     the choices made by men in fact create choices for the woman, because she     has the right to refuse him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The tradition is for the woman to be makhtoobah (proposed to)     and not khaatibah (the one who proposes); for her to be mankoohah (the one     who is married) and not naahikah (one who marries); for her to be matloobah     (the one who is sought) not taalibah (the one who seeks). This is something     that is deeply rooted in the nature of the sons of Adam and indeed other     living beings: the female is usually the one who is sought.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Despite that, there is no reason in sharee‘ah, if a woman     likes a man, for her not to express her wish to marry him. But that should     not be done in an appropriate manner. So she should not propose to him or be     the one who marries him; rather he is the one who proposes and she is the     one who is proposed to; he is the one who marries and she is the one who is     married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Eighthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Finally, you should understand that Islam honour woman as a     daughter, a mother and a wife: it protects her rights that have been taken     from her. In its laws it pays attention to woman’s weakness and emotional     nature. So it prescribes for her that which will protect her honour and     dignity. What you see of loss of honour and transgression against women in     the form of assault and rape is only because of the bad conduct of men who     have lost all mercy and compassion, and who have lost all sense that Allah     is always watching them; it is also because of women showing their     adornments and being heedless about mixing, shaking hands, working and     corresponding with men. If women adhered to the laws of Allah in their     clothing and by not mixing with men or travelling alone, and if they adhered     to Islamic guidelines on talking to men and looking at them, a great deal of     evil and mischief in society would come to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no doubt that allowing women to mix freely with men     is the basis of all calamities and evils, and it is one of the greatest     causes of bringing punishment upon the entire community. It is also one of     the causes of corruption in both public and private affairs. And mixing of     men with women is a cause of many immoral actions and zina, and it is one of     the causes of widespread death and ongoing plagues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah, p. 405&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please also see the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/40405\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">40405</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Our advice to you is to beware of the tricks of the Shaytaan,     to venerate your Lord, may He be exalted, be proud of your religion and     express your appreciation of the Prophet of Islam (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him). You should understand that life is not sex, such that     you should focus only on that issue. Islam is all great and its rulings are     all in the interests of both individuals and societies at all times and in     all places. Wise people in the West are entering the religion of Allah in     crowds, not in order to flatter anyone, but because of what they see of the     greatness of its laws and its suitability to all times and places. These     wise people differentiate between what they know of Islam and what they see     of the actions of some Muslims. So think again about what you said and take     another look at your verdict on Islam: you will see the greatness of this     religion and that you are enjoying a blessing of which millions of people     are deprived.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Is it true that all the disbelievers, even if their morals are good and they do not harm anyone, will enter Hell? If the answer is yes, then what about non-Muslim children and those who had no choice but to be born disbelievers?</p>\n",

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikun will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.” [Al-Bayyinah 98:6]</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies without having believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” (Narrated by Muslim, 153)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ill-Mannered_conduct_towards_Allah\">Ill-Mannered conduct towards Allah</span></h3>\n<p>The point is not whether <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/198330\" target=\"_blank\">their morals are good</a> , rather the point is whether they submit to Allah and obey his commands. Do you not see the Magians [Zoroastrians] or the Buddhists, for example, who worship fire or idols instead of Allah, and they do not worship Allah or submit to Him alone, and the Christians who say that God has a son, and other Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah). They are being ill-mannered towards Allah, and insulting and reviling Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says, `The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: Allah has taken to Himself a son, while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4974)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So how can their morals be good when they are so ill-mannered towards Allah, even though Allah has given them hearing and sight, and has made everything easy for them, and has sent His Messengers to them and revealed His Books to them, and bestowed His blessings upon them, so it is His right that they should thank Him and not be ungrateful to Him or disbelieve in Him. If they do not do that then they deserve His punishment and wrath. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“and your Lord treats no one with injustice.” [Al-Kahf 18:49]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_fate_of_the_children_of_disbelieversnbsp\">The fate of the children of disbelievers&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/6496\" target=\"_blank\">situation of their children who die when still young</a> , Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz was asked about that and he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/118103\" target=\"_blank\">If one who is not yet accountable dies among non-Muslim parents</a> , then he comes under the same rulings as them in this world, so he should not be washed and the funeral prayer should not be offered for him, and he should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But in the Hereafter his case is referred to Allah. It was narrated in an authentic report that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about the children of the Mushrikin he said: “Allah knows best what they would have done.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1384) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars were of the view that Allah’s knowledge about them will be made manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be tested, as <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98714\" target=\"_blank\">will the people who lived during the Fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If they do what they are told to do then they will enter Paradise, and if they disobey then they will enter Hell. There are authentic Hadiths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which say that the people who lived during the Fatrah (interval between two Prophets) will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. These are <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1244\" target=\"_blank\">the people whom the call of the Messengers did not reach</a> and those who come under a similar ruling, such as the children of the Mushrikin, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).” [Al-Isra’ 17:15]</p>\n<p>This is the most correct view among the various opinions concerning the people who lived during the Fatrah and others whom the call did not reach, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim, and a number of the earlier and later generations.
