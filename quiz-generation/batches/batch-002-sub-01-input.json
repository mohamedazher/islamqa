      "title": "Can I ask for a divorce because of my resentment towards my husband?",
      "question": "<p>I am suffering a lot of problems with my husband, which is because we are not getting along, especially since he is too busy at work, which requires him to spend a lot of time outside the home. I feel resentment towards him when he tries to get close to me, and sometimes I hate him, especially when he wants to have sex repeatedly and without any consideration for my feeling exhausted because of housework or because of severe sickness, even if I have a fever or am menstruating. Is this sufficient grounds for me to get a divorce, especially as I cannot carry on in this marriage to him?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It may be important here to remind the     questioner that for every problem there is a remedy and a solution, and     divorce may in fact be a solution to complex problems in marriage, and it is     for that reason that Allah has prescribed it. However, there is no doubt     that every smart person should regard it as being like painful cauterisation     which a sick person may have no choice but to undergo. As the Arabic proverb     says: The remedy of last resort is cauterisation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But before thinking of this     “cauterisation” it is essential to exhaust all other possible means of     reaching a deal that both spouses can agree to, whereby the problems will be     reduced and harmony will increase. Only then will one’s conscience be at     peace and one will be certain of the right decision that one may have to     take in order to find a solution.</p>\n<p>    It is most likely that the sister who     asked this question has heard or read a great deal of advice concerning this     matter, but that should not prevent us from offering her advice that may     provide her with another angle from which to examine the issue. Our advice     is that she should weigh up the pros and cons, and evaluate the possible bad     consequences that may convince a person of the right decision, rationally     and emotionally, with regard to breaking the ties of marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    One calm and quiet discussion – in many     cases – may be sufficient to bring about reconciliation between two gravely     dissenting parties. It is also guaranteed to pave the way towards complete     harmony and understanding. But unfortunately most people do not realise that     and they do not try to achieve it; rather they soon feel despair and give up     hope, because of the failure of one or two or more attempts. However the     wise person is the one who regards establishing a successful and happy     marriage as a challenge that he should try hard to meet, and he should not     be too hasty in announcing its failure, especially as human relations are     always subject to turmoil and ups and downs. In this way one may acquire     experience and attain the qualities of deliberation and calmness that will     help to ensure that any subsequent relationship may be successful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shar‘i reasons cannot occur in isolation;     rather each spouse should check himself or herself and watch out for     shortcomings with regard to his or her duties towards Allah. Perhaps a sin     that was committed may result in consequences that affect the individual     with regard to his or her family and household. Sin is the root of all     problems, and repentance and praying for forgiveness are at the root of all     remedies. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to fear     Him in dozens of places in his Holy Book, and he has made success and     prosperity in this world and the Hereafter dependent upon achieving this     important goal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted,     says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Keep your duty to     Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth.</p>\n<p>    H e will direct you to do righteous     good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His     Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) he has indeed achieved     a great achievement (i.e. he will be saved from the Hell-fire and made to     enter Paradise)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Ahzaab 33:70-71]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe (in Moosa (Moses)     (i.e. Jews) and ‘Eesa (Jesus) (i.e. Christians))! Fear Allah, and believe     too in His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), He will give you a double portion of     His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight),     and He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”</p>\n<p>    [al-Hadeed 57:28]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “And if the people of the towns had     believed and had the Taqwa (piety), certainly, We should have opened for     them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the     Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn     (polytheism and crimes, etc.)”</p>\n<p>    [al-A ‘raaf 7:96].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If living with one’s spouse is becoming     impossible and there is no more room for mutual understanding or treating     one another on the basis of kindness and honouring mutual rights, then there     is no blame on the wife if she seeks divorce.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have     mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If problems have begun to appear between     the couple and the woman can no longer give the man his rights and she     resents him, or she cannot live with him any more, then she has the right to     release herself from him by giving back what he gave her, and there is     nothing wrong with her giving that to him or him accepting it from her.     Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):     “And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of     your Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of     marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they     would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g. to deal with each     other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep     the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she     gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul (divorce)” [al-Baqarah     2:229].</p>\n<p>    End quote from Tafseer al-Qur’an al-‘Azeem     (1/613)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is proven in the Sunnah that the     wife of Thaabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah     be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with     Thaabit regarding his religious commitment or his attitude, but I hate to go     back to kufr after coming to Islam. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Will you give his garden back to him?”     She said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) said (to Thaabit): “Accept your garden, and divorce her (one talaaq).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5273)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That is, I do not want to leave him     because of any bad attitude on his part or shortcoming in his religious     commitment. The report of Ayyoob mentioned above adds: But I cannot stand     him. … In fact another reason was stated clearly, which is that he was     physically ugly.&nbsp; In the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from     his grandfather – which was narrated by Ibn Maajah – it says: Habeebah bint     Sahl was married to Thaabit ibn Qays, who was an ugly man. She said, O     Messenger of Allaah, by Allaah, were it not for fear of Allaah, when he     enters upon me I would spit in his face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The words “but I hate to go back to kufr     after coming to Islam” mean: If I stay with him, I would hate to do anything     that could lead to kufr. … It is as if she was hinting that her intense     dislike for him could lead her to make a show of kufr so that her marriage     to him would be annulled. She knew that this was haraam, but she was afraid     that her intense dislike would make her do that. Or it may be that what she     meant by kufr here was ingratitude to her husband, when falling short with     regard to her husband’s rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Fath al-Baari     (9/399-400)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    However, we should point out to the     questioner here that with regard to her husband’s desire for intercourse     during her menses it is not permissible for her to obey him in that regard;     rather she has to refuse and tell him that this is haraam. If he does not     pay attention to that and transgresses the limit set by Allah with regard to     this matter, then this alone is sufficient grounds for separation. In fact     Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the     husband repeatedly has intercourse with his wife during her menses, and he     does not pay heed, then they should be separated, as we said with regard to     a husband who has anal intercourse with his wife and does not pay heed.</p>\n<p>    End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah     by al-Ba‘li (27)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answers to questions no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/99870\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">99870</a>     and     <a href=\"/ar/answers/\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">117185</a></p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

That is their saying with their mouths…” [al-Tawbah 9:30]</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah: “The well known view is that ‘Uzayr was one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel.” On this basis there is nothing wrong with calling him ‘Uzayr, so long as there is no inclination of the heart towards the Jews, and so long as one is not influenced by them because of being their neighbour. The scholarly differences as to whether ‘Uzayr was actually a Prophet or not are well known.</p>\n",

      "title": "Wants to marry a\r\n    girl but his father does not approve of her",
      "question": "<p>I have chosen a religious and<br />\n      well-mannered girl to be my wife, but when I told my father about this, he rejected the<br />\n      idea. I have tried to convince him but he is insisting. I wanted to know why, but he said<br />\n      there is no reason why. I am confused. Should I obey my father and forget about the girl I<br />\n      have chosen even though this will cause me and my family so much pain? I hope that you<br />\n      will advise of the right thing to do. May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet  (peace and blessings of    Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother    what he likes for himself.”</p>\n<p>It is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so    that you will understand what is going on. </p>\n<p>Our advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and    avoid division, then do so.</p>\n<p>But you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to    help you make the right choice.</p>\n",

      "title": "Advice to one who wants to get married but is not able for it",
      "question": "<p>In the mosque we had a program where the Muslim youth could discuss with those who are older the ahaadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning marriage, and the fact that they should make it easy for the youth to get married. This subject led to a number of discussions, because the parents are concerned about the situation and welfare of the couple, especially if they have children. <br />\n<br />\nYoung people nowadays do not complete their university studies until the age of 21, or 23 for those who study medicine. They cannot afford the expenses of marriage. So what practical advice can you give them? Many of the Muslim youth in the west want to complete half of their religion.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Discussing Islamic matters and spending time     on that is one of the most beneficial things that a person can do for himself, because seeking knowledge is an obligation and an act of worship,     and he is spending time in doing something that is of benefit to him and to others. If the people who are discussing do not understand something,     then they have to ask people who have knowledge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice to those who live in the lands of     immorality and kufr is to migrate from them to the Muslim lands where the temptations of this world and of women are less. The Muslim countries     are not equal in that regard, so he has to choose the best of them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise them to leave every environment in     which he may stumble and fall, whether that is his accommodation, his work or his school/college.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise them to hasten to marry, and to     choose righteous wives who do not make extravagant demands with regard to the mahr, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We advise those who are unable to get married     to fear Allaah and not to look at or listen to haraam things, not to walk towards haraam things, not to touch that which it is not permissible for     him to touch. They should help themselves in this regard by fasting and praying, making du’aa’, and keeping company with righteous people. They     should keep themselves busy with beneficial things such as seeking knowledge, memorizing Qur’aan and making du’aa’ to Allaah, for if a person     keeps busy in obeying Allaah, that will distract him from disobeying Him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advise to community leaders and parents     and guardians of boys and girls is not to regard completion of studies as an impediment to marriage. Since when is marriage an obstacle to     acquiring knowledge?! Rather reality and experience point to the opposite, because marriage helps a person to focus and makes his mind clear, and     above all that it is obedience to the command of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the youth to get married.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So parents and guardians should not burden     the youth with excessive demands that may be regarded as a form of extravagance. They should limit the demands to that which the woman and the     house need only. They should understand that marriage is one of the means by which provision is sought. Allaah says (interpretation of the     meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no     husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor,     Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people)”</p>\n<p>[al-Noor 24:32]</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Do weight loss injections invalidate the fast?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to take injections for weight loss half an hour before Iftar, knowing that they are administered either in the stomach, thigh, or arm, and they release a hormone in the body that helps to increase insulin levels; to enhance the metabolic rate, assist in eating a smaller quantity of food, and to suppress appetite<span>?</span></p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Weight loss injections, which are one of the therapeutic techniques that help reduce weight, rely on injecting the body with the substance liraglutide, a protein similar to carbohydrates that affects neural receptors in the brain, working to suppress appetite and reduce sugar intake.</p>\n<p>Saxenda injections work to lower blood sugar levels by preventing the body from secreting the hormone glucagon, which affects sensory receptors in the brain, thereby reducing appetite for food and increasing the feeling of fullness. Consequently, the rate of fat burning in the body increases, and it is converted into the energy needed by the body. End quote.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>These injections are neither food nor drink, nor do they serve as a substitute for them, meaning they are not nutritious, and therefore they have no effect on fasting.</p>\n<p>Since they help suppress appetite, they are not considered the same as nutritious injections.</p>\n<p>It is stated in \"Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da'imah\" (10/252):</p>\n<p>\"It is permissible for a fasting person to be treated with injections in the muscle or vein during the daytime in Ramadan.</p>\n<p>However, it is not permissible for a fasting person to take nutritional injections during the daytime in Ramadan; because it is similar to consuming food and drink, and taking such injections is considered a trick to break the fast in Ramadan.

      "title": "He hates life and wishes for death",
      "question": "<p>What is the Islamic ruling on a man who hates this life very much, and asks Allah to cause him to die if that is good for him, and he is waiting for death?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to hate life and despair of what Allah, may He be exalted, could grant him of relief and good health. What is required of him is to bear with patience whatever he is facing of what Allah has willed and decreed, and to seek reward with Him, may He be exalted, for what befalls him of calamities, and to ask Him, may He be glorified, to avert that from him, to help him and to reward him for what He decrees should befall him of that. And he should wait for relief from Allah, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): <em>“For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.&nbsp; Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease” [ash-Sharh 94:5-6]</em>. It is makrooh for a Muslim to wish for death because of some harm that befell him, such as sickness, hardship or anything else. In <em>as-Saheehayn</em> it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death because of some harm that befalls him. But if he must do that, then let him say: ‘O Allah, cause me to live so long as life is good for me, and cause me to die so long as that is good for me.’” From the wording of the hadith, we understand that this is a kind of delegating one’s affairs to Allah and submitting to His will and decree. Whatever befalls a Muslim of calamities in this world is an expiation for him, if he seeks reward for that with Allah, may He be exalted, and does not become discontent. This is a wake-up call to turn away from heedlessness, and a lesson for the future.</p>\n<p>And Allah is the source of strength.

      "title": "Ruling on defaming and exposing offences committed by non-Muslims",
      "question": "<p>One of my non-Muslim work colleagues was caught red-handed trying to defraud a citizen, and he took some money from him unlawfully, by abusing his position at work. During the court proceedings against him, he was still coming to work, taking advantage of the fact that the manager at work is a close friend of his, and he is also a non-Muslim. I spoke against him in front of others and in his presence, without addressing him directly, but I mentioned him by name and I mentioned his abhorrent actions and denounce his evil deeds, especially since we are sure that the manager will try to protect him from any punishment imposed by the law. Some of my Muslim colleagues objected to my speaking against him and said: Islam does not enjoin us to do that, because it is blameworthy schadenfreude, and Allah prefers concealment in such situations, and I was hurting his feelings, and it was sufficient that he felt ashamed and embarrassed with us, so we should console him and not expose him. Please explain what we should do in such situations.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The one who is caught red-handed trying to defraud someone deserves punishment, and he must return what he took unlawfully. This is something that is to be decided by the judicial authorities, or by the departmental body that has the authority to question him.</p>\n<p>It is not appropriate to expose him or tell everybody of his misdeeds, unless he did it blatantly and recklessly, or there is the fear that he could defraud or cheat more people, if people are not aware of him and if he appears to be persisting in committing his misdemeanours.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the concealment that is required in this case, what is meant by that is concealment of those who appear to be good people and the like, who are not known to be evildoers or mischief makers.</p>\n<p>As for one who is known for being like that, it is recommended that his situation should not be concealed; rather his case should be referred to the authorities, provided that there is no fear of any negative consequences, because concealing in this case will encourage him to do more harm and spread more mischief, and transgress the sacred limits, and it will encourage others to do likewise. End quote from Sharh Muslim (16/135).</p>\n<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone is well known for committing sins, and does so openly, and does not care what he commits of sins or what is said about him, then he is an evildoer who commits evil openly, and talking about him and his misdeeds is not regarded as backbiting, as al-Hasan al-Basri and others stated. With regard to such a person, there is nothing wrong with investigating and finding out about him, so that the hadd punishments may be carried out against him. That was stated clearly by one of our companions, and he quoted as evidence for that the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “O Unays, go to the wife of that man in the morning, and if she admits it, then stone her.” There can be no intercession for such a person if he is caught, even if the authorities are not informed; rather he should be left so that the hadd punishment may be carried out against him, in order to put an end to his evil and to deter others like him.</p>\n<p>Maalik said: If someone is not known to cause harm and offence to people – rather he made a mistake – there is nothing wrong with interceding for him, provided that news of his case has not reached the authorities. But if he is known for evildoing and mischief, I would not approve of anyone interceding for him; rather he should be left so that the hadd punishment may be carried out against him. This was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir and others. End quote from Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (1/341).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by concealing is hiding faults, concealing is not something praiseworthy unless it serves an interest and will not lead to evil consequences. For example, if an offender commits an offence, we do not conceal him if he is known to be an evildoer and mischief maker. But in the case of a man who appears to be good, then he did something that is not permissible, concealment may be what is required in his case. So concealment depends on what interest is to be served; the person who is known for evildoing and mischief should not be concealed, whereas in the case of one who appears to be good but made a mistake, the Sunnah is to conceal his mistake.

Ibn Hibbaan included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled, “The Fire is the lot of the one who says things to offend the People of the Book,” in which he quoted the hadith of Abu Moosaa, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Whoever says something offensive to a Jew or a Christian will enter the fire.” This hadith was classed as saheeh by Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq Ibn Hibbaan, and by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, no. 3093.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar al-Haytami said in az-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir (2/27): al-Ghazaali was asked in his Fataawa about backbiting about a disbeliever.</p>\n<p>He said: On the part of the Muslim it is forbidden for three reasons: hurting the feelings of a fellow human; belittling the creation of Allah, for Allah is the Creator of people’s deeds; and wasting time on something that is of no benefit.</p>\n<p>He said: The ruling on the first is that it is haraam, on the second that it is makrooh, and on the third that it is other than what is more appropriate.</p>\n<p>With regard to the dhimmi [a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], he is like the Muslim in that no one should hurt him, because Islam has protected his honour, his life and his wealth. It says in al-Khaadim: The first reason is the correct reason [i.e., the first reason – which is that it is hurting the feelings of a fellow human – is the real reason why it is forbidden].</p>\n<p>Ibn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says something offensive to a Jew or a Christian will enter the fire.”</p>\n<p>What is meant in this hadith is saying something to annoy or offend him. This settles the matter, because it clearly indicates that it is haraam to do that.</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazaali said: As for the harbi [a non-Muslim whose people are at war with the Muslims], it is not haraam with regard the first reason, but with regard to the second and third reasons it is makrooh.</p>\n<p>As for the innovator, if his innovation constitutes disbelief, then he comes under the same ruling as the harbi; otherwise, he comes under the same ruling as a Muslim. As for speaking about him in the context of his innovation, that is not makrooh.

      "question": "<p>Assalam alaikum,<br />\nThe question has arisen due to many needy Muslims who are being thrown<br />\nout of schools due to lack of tuition. There are many Muslims who have bank<br />\naccounts which give interest, and they have not been using it as interest is<br />\nharam. What should one do with the interest. Should he leave it to the bank<br />\nor can it be used for such case as paying the tuition to the non Islamic<br />\ninstitutions ?<br />\nPlease give valid reasons. This question is very important and urgent as the<br />\nacademic term has just started and funds are not available. <br />\nJazakawallahu Kheiran,</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>and may His peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Muhammad  and on his family and companions.</p>\n<p>To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani , May Allah safeguard you , Judge of Nairobi - Kenya </p>\n<p>May Allaah’s peace and blessings be upon you.</p>\n<p>I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what scholars have mentioned: </p>\n<p>If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the purification of one’s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and good.</p>\n<p>This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc… Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is considered as lost money that no one owns.</p>\n<p>Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims.</p>\n<p>Reference: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/401-411, \"What should one do who repents from earning forbidden money\", Al-Fawzaan.</p>\n",

      "title": "With regard to wiping over the head cover for a woman, are the same conditions stipulated as for wiping over the khuffs?",
      "question": "<p>What are the rulings for a woman wiping over her head cover when doing wudu? Are they the same as the rulings on wiping over the socks?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>We have previously discussed the ruling on wiping over the head cover, and the difference of scholarly opinion concerning that, in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/148129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">148129</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Those Hanbali scholars who say it is permissible for a woman to wipe over her head cover, say that it comes under the same ruling as the khuffs and socks, so they stipulated that it must have been put on when in a state of purity, and said that the time period during which it is permissible to wipe over it is the same as that for the khuffs and socks.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the ruling on wiping over the turban:</p>\n<p>The ruling on the turban with regard to the time period during which it is permissible to wipe over it, and the stipulation that it should be put on when one is in a state of purity, and that the state of purity is broken if it is taken off, is the same as the ruling on khuffs, because they are both to be wiped over when purifying oneself, on the basis of comparison.(<em>Al-Kafi</em>, 1/39).</p>\n<p>But it does not seem that this view is correct, because neither the head cover nor the turban come under the same ruling as the khuffs. Therefore what is stipulated in the case of the head cover and turban is not the same as what is stipulated with regard to wiping over the khuffs, and drawing an analogy with the khuffs is far-fetched. The original ruling regarding the feet is that they are to be washed [when doing wudu], in contrast to the head, regarding which the original ruling is that it is to be wiped. Moreover, only the top of the khuff is to be wiped, but wiping over the head cover is not like wiping over the khuffs; rather the correct view is that the entire head is to be wiped, whether all of it is uncovered or covered, or part of it is uncovered and the other part is covered.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>There is no reason in common between the rulings on wiping over the turban or head cover and wiping over the khuffs. Rather the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that one must be in a state of purity when putting on the khuffs in order to be able to wipe over them, but he did not make any such stipulation in the case of the turban and head cover. Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {… that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them} [An-Nahl 16:44], {And never is your Lord forgetful} [Maryam 19:64]. If that were required with regard to the turban and head cover, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have explained it as he explained that with regard to the khuffs. The one who says that the turban and head cover are the same as the khuffs in this regard is making a claim with no proof, and he must provide proper evidence to support this claim. So it should be said to him: How do you conclude from the Prophet’s words about wiping over the khuffs and the requirement to be in a state of purity before putting them on that this also applies to the turban and head cover? There is no way to come up with such an argument except on the basis of individual opinion, which carries no weight. Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {Produce your evidence if you are telling the truth} [Al-Baqarah 2:111].</p>\n<p><em>Al-Muhalla</em>, 1/310.</p>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If someone were to say: Because wiping over the khuffs is permitted for a specific time limit when travelling and for a different specific time limit when not travelling, then wiping over the turban should be likewise, this is a claim for which there is no proof of its soundness, and a statement for which there is no evidence that it is obligatory. It should be said to him: What is your evidence to prove what you are saying about the ruling for wiping over the turban being the same as the two times mentioned with regard to wiping over the khuffs? This is something for which there is no proof at all except his statement. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wiped over his turban and head cover, and he did not stipulate a time limit for that as he did for wiping over the khuffs. Therefore we must say what he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, and not say anything about issues of religion that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never said. Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not transgress them} [Al-Baqarah 2:229].</p>\n<p><em>Al-Muhalla</em>, 1/310.</p>\n<p>There is not even a single soundly-narrated religious text stipulating that the turban must be put on when in a state of purity in order to be able to wipe over it, and there is no time limit regarding that for one who is not travelling or one who is travelling. What has been narrated concerning that is weak (da`if), such as the hadith of Abu Umamah, which says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wipe over his khuffs and turban for three days when travelling and for one day and one night when not travelling.</p>\n<p>Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>But its chain of narrators includes Marwan Abu Salamah. Ibn Abi Hatim said: He is not strong. Al-Bukhari said: His hadith is odd. Al-Azdi said: He is nothing. Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about this hadith and he said: It is not authentic.(<em>Nayl al-Awtar</em>, 1/204).</p>\n<p>See also the answers to questions no.&nbsp; <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/129557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">129557</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/72391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">72391</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/139719\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">139719</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The Jews had Saturday, and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and Allah guided us to Friday. So there is Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and we will be dealt with before all others.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Muslim, 856)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Al-Qadi said: The apparent meaning is that it was obligatory for them to venerate Friday but this was not stated clearly; the matter was left to their own reasoning… But they did not manage to work it out and Allah did not guide them to it. It was enjoined clearly upon this ummah, and was not left to their own reasoning, thus they were blessed with it … It was narrated that Musa enjoined Friday upon them and told them of its virtues, but they disputed with him and argued that Saturday was better, and it was said to him, ‘Let them be.’ Al-Qadi said: if there had been a clear command, their arguing with him would not have been valid, rather it would have been said to him that they were going against the command. I say: it may be that that was clearly enjoined upon them but they disputed as to whether it was something they had to adhere to or they could change it to another day; they decided to change it to another day and they erred greatly thereby.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that Friday was specifically enjoined upon them and they went against that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz said: “How can it be otherwise when they are the ones who said “We hear and we disobey”?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aws ibn Aws narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On that day Adam (peace be upon him) was created; on that day he died; on that day the Trumpet will be blown and on that day all of creation will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings upon me, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings upon you be shown to you when you have turned to dust?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets, peace be upon them.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1047; classed as sahih by Ibn al-Qayyim in his comments on Sunan Abi Dawud, 4/273; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 925)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted to Paradise and on it he was expelled therefrom.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Muslim, 1410)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith includes some of the reasons why Friday is regarded as special. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The apparent meaning is that these virtues do not mean that Friday is regarded as special because Adam was expelled on a Friday and the Hour will begin on a Friday. Rather it is meant to explain what momentous events took place and will take place on this day, so that people will make the most of this day to do righteous deeds, so as to attain the mercy of Allah and ward off His punishment.&nbsp; This is the view of al-Qadi. Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said in his book al-Ahwadhi fi Sharh al-Tirmidhi: All of these events are good and add to the virtue of Friday. The expulsion of Adam from Paradise is the reason why his offspring and the messengers, the prophets, the righteous and the awliya exist. He was not expelled from it as such, but rather it was for a purpose, then he will return to it. With regard to the Hour beginning on a Friday, the reason is so that the reward may be hastened for the prophets, believers in truth, awliya and others, and their honour and high status may be made manifest. This hadith points to the virtues of Friday and its high status in relation to the other days.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Lubabah ibn ‘Abd al-Mundhir said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Friday is the master of days, and the greatest of them before Allah. It is greater before Allah than the day of al-Adha and the day of al-Fitr. It has five characteristics: on this day Allah created Adam, on it He sent Adam down to the earth, on it Allah caused Adam to die, on it there is a time when a person does not ask Allah for anything but He gives it to him, so long as he does not ask for anything haram, and on it the Hour will begin. There is no angel who is close to Allah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain and no sea that does not fear Friday.”&nbsp;(Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1084; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, no. 2279)</p>\n<p>Al-Sanadi said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“They fear Friday” means they fear the onset of the Hour.
