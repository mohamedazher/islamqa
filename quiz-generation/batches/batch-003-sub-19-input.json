      "title": "Minimum Days between Two Periods in Islam",
      "question": "<p>What is the minimum period of purity (Tuhr)? My menstrual cycle is not regular. Sometimes I do not have a period for months, sometimes it comes on time. I did ghusl following my period ten days ago, and during this time there was some light yellow spotting from time to time, but after ten days it increased and became a new period, with cramps (period pains) and the usual colour of menstrual blood. I was told to do ghusl and pray because the minimum length of Tuhr (purity following the previous period) is fifteen days. Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good, because I stopped praying, thinking that this was a period.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is no set minimum limit for the period of purity between two menstrual periods, rather when a woman sees the blood – i.e., menstrual blood which is “black” (dark red), recognizable and has a distinct odour – she should refrain from fasting and praying, on condition that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/221997\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the total number of days of menstrual bleeding does not exceed half of the cycle</a>&nbsp;(i.e., fifteen days in the month).</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50059\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yellowish and brownish discharges seen after the period has ended</a>&nbsp;are of no significance and they do not come under the same rulings as menstruation.</p>\n<p>Find further details in these answers: (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/220644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">220644</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/292538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">292538</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/68818\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">68818</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">82507</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/247317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">247317</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">57</a>)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The myth that visiting the grave of ‘Ali equals seventy Hajj",
      "question": "<p>Does visiting the graves of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), al-Husayn, al-‘Abbaas and others equal seventy pilgrimages to the Sacred House of Allaah? Did the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “Whoever visits the members of my household (ahl bayti) after I die will have seventy Hajj recorded for him”? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Visiting graves is a Sunnah which provides a lesson and a reminder. If the graves are those of Muslims, one should make du’aa’ for them… The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves and make du’aa’ for the deceased, as did his companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter.” He used to teach his companions, when they visited graves, to say, “Al-salaamu ‘alayum ahl al-diyaar min al-mu’mineen wa’l-muslimeen, wa innaa in sha Allaah bikum laahiqoon. Nas’al Allaaha lana wa lakum al-‘aafiyah (Peace be upon you O inhabitants of the dwellings, believers and Muslims. If Allaah wills, we shall join you soon. We ask Allaah to keep us and you safe and sound.).” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah: “Yarham Allaah al-mustaqdimeena minna wa’l-musta’khireen (may Allaah have mercy on those of us who went first and those who will join them afterward).” According to the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas “yaghfir Allaah lana wa lakum, antum salafuna wa nahnu fi’l-athr (May Allaah forgive us and you. You are our predecessors and we are following in your footsteps).” Making du’aa’ for them in these or similar words is all good. Visiting them brings a reminder and a lesson to the believer to prepare for what has befallen them, i.e., death, for what happened to them will happen to him too. So let him make preparations and strive to obey Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and keep away from that which Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden. Let him repent from his previous shortcomings. This is how the believer is to benefit from visiting graves. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what is mentioned (in the question) about visiting the graves of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), al-Hasan, al-Husayn and others being equivalent to seventy Hajj – this is a lie and is falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it has no basis. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the best of all, is not equivalent to one Hajj; this visit has its status and virtues, but it is not equivalent to Hajj, so how about visits to anyone else’s grave? This is a lie, as is the phrase “Whoever visits the members of my household (ahl bayti) after I die will have seventy Hajj recorded for him.” All of this has no basis at all and all of it is false. All of it is lies made up by the liars. The believer has to beware of these fabricated things that have been falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is Sunnah to visit the graves whether they are graves of the members of his household (Ahl al-Bayt) or other Muslims; (it is Sunnah) to visit them, make du’aa’ for them, pray for mercy for them and then leave. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If they are the graves of kaafirs, they may be visited for the purpose of learning a lesson and being reminded, without making du’aa’ for them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) visited his mother’s grave, but his Lord forbade him to pray for forgiveness for her. He visited her grave for the purpose of the lesson and reminder, but he did not pray for forgiveness for her. This applies to all other graves – graves of kaafirs – if a believer visits them for the purpose of the lesson and reminder, there is nothing wrong with that, but he should not greet them with salaams or pray for forgiveness for them, because they do not deserve that.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on “skin sewing” that can be removed at any time",
      "question": "<p>I would like to know whether “skin sewing” comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah, which is haraam and with which Iblees threatened the slaves of Allah. In brief, this refers to a form of adornment in which a needle with thread is passed beneath the transparent outer layers of dead skin on the hands and feet only. And we do not pass a needle any deeper than that, into the layers of the skin. This method means that the needle does not cause any sensation of pain or leave any marks in the skin at all after sewing with the needle. It is possible to remove the needle from the skin on the same day, and it is not permanent at all, hence I do not regard it as being like tattoos or plucking the eyebrows in any way  like the haraam things mentioned above. I hope that you can clarify this matter.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We have not come across this type of adornment except in the following clip:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ3p490mHog\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ3p490mHog</a></p>\n<p>If the matter is as it appears to us to be, and as you mentioned in your question, that it involves inserting the needle into the dead layer of skin and using a thread that is not permanent, rather it is removed within one or two days, then what appears to be the case is that this does not come under the heading of tattooing and there does not seem to be any reason to disallow it, if there is no risk of harm.</p>\n<p>We have previously stated that it is permissible to use temporary tattoos, subject to certain guidelines, as in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/99629\" target=\"_blank\">99629</a>. This is no different to that in terms of ruling.</p>\n<p>But we should pay attention to an important matter having to do with this sewing, which is that it is done in parts of the body that are washed when doing wudoo’ and purifying oneself. Therefore what appears to be the case, from what we have seen, is that this prevents the water from reaching the skin and makes it not possible to wash the part of the body that must be washed when doing wudoo’ or ghusl.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, then it is not permissible to do this in the places that must be washed in wudoo’, because it makes no sense to do this and then remove it the time of each prayer.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbid his daughter Fatimah to complain about her husband?",
      "question": "<p>My in-laws are from the Tablighi jamat and their scolar who came to our house said that we shld stop complain and gave refrence of the incident where Hazrat Fatima complained about Hazrat Ali 's big stomach wealth and quoted this When Fatimah came, the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked her if she came to complain about Ali. She replied that she had. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: \"By the Lord of the Ka'bah! Go back to Ali and tell him that you are prepared to rub your nose in dust in order to keep him happy. You may do as you please.\" (Jailul 'Uyoon: 61) Is this incident authentic or jus a made up story.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We have not come across this report which speaks of Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) complaining to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about her husband ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>With regard to women complaining about their husbands, that is not all at the same level. In some cases it is permissible, in order for the woman to ward off harm from herself or her faith.</p>\n<p>An example of that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (5364) and Muslim (1714) from ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which Hind bint ‘Utbah said: O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a stingy man and he does not give me enough maintenance for myself and my children, except what I take from him without his knowledge. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children, on a reasonable basis.”</p>\n<p>In the case of Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) feared that she would be put to trial, he listened to her complaint.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (3729) and Muslim (2449) narrated that al-Miswar ibn Makhramah said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib proposed to the daughter of Abu Jahl, and he was already married to Faatimah the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When Faatimah heard of that she came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Your people are saying that you do not get angry for the sake of your daughters, and ‘Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl.</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and I heard him when he recited the shahadah, then he said: “I gave a daughter of mine in marriage to Abu’l-‘As ibn ar-Rabi‘, and when he spoke he told me the truth. Fatimah bint Muhammad is a part of me, and I do not like to see her upset. By Allah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah and the daughter of the enemy of Allah will not be joined together as wives of one man.” So ‘Ali abandoned that proposal.</p>\n<p>According to a report narrated by al-Bukhari (3110) and Muslim (2449) from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, he said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib proposed marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl (to be a co-wife) to Fatimah, and I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) addressing the people concerning that, on this minbar of his, and I was an adolescent at that time. He said: “Fatimah is part of me, and I fear lest she be put to trial with regard to her religious commitment.”</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>“and I fear lest she be put to trial with regard to her religious commitment” means: she will not be able to put up with jealousy, so if she became angry, she would treat her husband in a way that is not befitting to her commitment to Islam [because it would be contrary to Islamic teachings].\"(<em>Fath al-Bari</em>&nbsp; 9/329).</p>\n<p>With regard to problems that the Muslim woman is able to resolve through dialogue with her husband and with patience, it is more appropriate in this case for her not to complain.</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>The questioner is saying: I have a sister who is married, and she has problems with her husband and his family. When she comes to visit us, she tells us what is happening to her and her children, and she cries a great deal, because she is being mistreated a great deal. We advise her to be patient, but I wonder: does she have the right to do that when she is with us? May Allah reward you with good, what do you advise us to do?</p>\n<p>Answer: we advise her to be patient, if her husband is a good man; we advise her to be patient and not complain to you and not tell you anything. Rather that should be between her and her husband. If she is able to ask his father, older brother or maternal or paternal uncle, if they are good, to advise him, if there is a need to do that, then there is nothing wrong with it. But whenever it is possible for her to solve her problems between her and him by herself, that is more appropriate. She should use good manners and good words, and show kindness, until he calms down, so that he can respond to her request, and she should not be harsh and tough, and should not forsake him and the like. Rather she should handle matters wisely, with good words and a kind approach.</p>\n<p>The husband should fear Allah and treat his wife kindly, using good words and a gentle approach. Each of them should strive to show kindness and goodness, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And live with them in kindness}&nbsp;[An-Nisa’ 4:19]</p>\n<p>{And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable}&nbsp;[Al-Baqarah 2:228].\"(<em>Nur ‘ala ad-Darb&nbsp;</em>21/234).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She did not know the signs of puberty so she did not fast in Ramadaan, out of ignorance",
      "question": "<p>According to custom in some Muslim countries, menstruation is regarded as the sign of puberty for women and no attention is paid to the other signs, such as the growth of pubic hair etc, which are known from the books of fiqh. <br />\nAs a result of this kind of custom, one of the sisters started to observe the obligatory fast of Ramadaan after she saw menstrual blood, although at that time she was thirteen years old and she already had pubic hair before she got her period, but she does not remember whether that hair was coarse or not, and she does not remember how many years she did not fast after that hair appeared.  My question is: <br />\n1 – What are the signs of a woman’s puberty, according to sharee’ah or to custom? <br />\n2 – What is the ruling on this sister’s not fasting during those Ramadaans when her hair had started to grow but she had not yet started her periods, if the custom on this issue is contrary to sharee’ah?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>A woman is deemed to have reached puberty when one of four things happens:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – When she reaches the age of fifteen.</p>\n<p>2 – When her pubic hair grows, which is hair around the private parts.</p>\n<p>3 – When she emits maniy (fluid released at climax).</p>\n<p>4 – When she starts to menstruate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If one of these four things happens, then she has reached the age of puberty and she is now regarded as accountable, and she is obliged to do acts of worship just like adults. If a woman did not know that puberty begins in this manner, then there is no sin on her for not fasting, because she was unaware, and there is no sin on the person who is unaware so long as he was not negligent about learning or finding out when he was able to do so. But she must hasten to make up the fasts that she missed because when a woman reaches the age of puberty, she becomes accountable and she must make up the fasts that she missed during the time when she was accountable. She must strive to work out how many days she missed after she reached puberty, and hasten to make them up so there will no longer be any sin on her.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should he buy shares in a company that puts its money in the bank and pays a part of the profits?",
      "question": "<p>The scholars have said that it is permissible to buy shares that are basically halaal and are put in the riba-based banks, on the condition that 15% of the profit is paid in the public interest. <br />\n<br />\nMy question is: <br />\n<br />\nIs it permissible to give that to relatives to benefit from it, such as one’s mother or siblings?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Buying shares in companies and organizations is permissible     on the condition that they are trading in permissible goods and are not     engaging in haraam transactions. One of the greatest of haraam actions is     consuming riba. If one of these two conditions is broken, and the company is     dealing in haraam things or is manufacturing haraam things, or it is dealing     in riba, then buying shares is haraam and one should avoid that and find     something permissible. The fact that a certain percentage of the profits is     paid (in charity) does not make it permissible to buy those shares or make     that profit halaal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have     mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying shares in companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Buying shares in companies is subject to further discussion,     because we have heard that they put their money in foreign banks, or     quasi-foreign banks, and take interest on it, which is a kind of riba. If     this is true then buying shares in them is haraam and is a major sin,     because riba is one of the worst of major sins. But if it is free of this     then buying shares is halaal, so long as there is nothing else involved that     is haraam according to sharee’ah. End quote.</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen     (18/question no. 119).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is it permissible to buy shares in companies and     organizations that offer their shares to the public at a time when we are     uncertain as to whether these companies and organizations engage in riba in     their dealings and we are not sure about that. Please note that we cannot be     sure about that, but it is what we have heard from other people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    They replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to companies and organizations that do not engage     in riba or deal in haraam things, it is permissible to buy shares in them,     but as for those that engage in riba or any haraam things, it is haraam to     buy shares in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If there is uncertainty about any company, then it is safer     not to buy shares in them, based on the words of the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Leave that which makes you doubt for that     which does not make you doubt.” And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever avoids doubtful things has discharged his     duty and protected his religious commitment and honour.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd     al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn     Qa’ood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah     wa’l-Ifta’ (14/310-311)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/21127\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">21127</a> we quoted the fatwa of     the Standing Committee which states the ruling on buying shares in     charitable organizations, agriculture companies, banks, insurance companies     and petroleum companies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the answer to question no.     <a href=\"/en/answers/8590\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">8590</a> you will find the ruling     on dealing in permissible shares and a warning against haraam shares.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the share holder gets haraam profits from his shares, he     must – after taking out his share and keeping it – get rid of the money that     is surplus to his capital. He can spend it on charitable causes so long as     he does not benefit from that in any way or relieve himself of some     obligation or ward off some harm or wrongdoing from himself.

So it is not permissible for the husband to burden his wife with that which she is unable to bear, by combining the burdens of life, working outside the home and bearing children.</p>\n<p>As pregnancy is a reason for which some duties are waived, such as fasting, then it is more appropriate that it should be a reason for it being obligatory for the husband to take care of his wife and show compassion towards her with regard to her serving him and taking care of the house.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Balance_of_Responsibilities_in_Pregnancy\">The Balance of Responsibilities in Pregnancy</span></h3>\n<p>Although the basic Islamic principle on which the scholars unanimously agreed is that “hardship dictates that things should be made easier”, and there is corroborating evidence that confirms that, it is also essential that the wife’s serving of her husband should not lead to extraordinary hardship or a great deal of hardship. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, does not want duties to cause undue hardship to people as He, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says: (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.} [Al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>{Allah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you; and man was created weak} [An-Nisa 4:28]</p>\n<p>{Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour on you that you may be thankful.” [Al-Maidah 5:6]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Islamic_Encouragement_for_a_Peaceful_Home_Environment\">Islamic Encouragement for a Peaceful Home Environment</span></h3>\n<p>If the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined kindness to slaves and servants, and he forbade their masters to burden them with anything that would be too difficult for them, unless they help them with it — “(They are) your brothers and servants whom Allah has placed under your control, so whoever has his brother under his control, let him feed him what he eats and clothe him with what he wears, and do not burden him with more than he can bear. And do not burden them with more than they can bear, and if you do that, then help them” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2545 and Muslim, 1661) — then how about a man’s wife and life companion?!</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (my Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, I emphasize the rights of the two weak ones: orphans and women.” (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (15/416); Muassasat Ar-Risalah edn., The editors said: Its chain of narration is strong.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Practical_Advice_for_couples_during_Pregnancy\">Practical Advice for couples during Pregnancy</span></h3>\n<p>At the end of that answer, we advise the wife to look after her house as much as possible and to provide comfort for everyone in it, and to do her utmost to create an atmosphere of peace and tranquillity, and everything that is needed.</p>\n<p>And she should ask Allah, may He be Exalted, to help her with that. We hope that Allah, may He be Exalted, will honour her with kind treatment from her husband and his help if she tries sincerely for the sake of Allah and does not fall short or neglect anything.</p>\n<p>We do not think that you should go to your mother’s house to eat there and leave your husband; rather you should stay with your husband. If you feel energetic and strong, then serve him and meet his needs. All women get pregnant as you are pregnant; do you see women leaving their houses and forsaking their husbands?</p>\n<p>Although we excuse you because of your situation and we would remind your husband of your rights, it is not appropriate for you to take that as an excuse to omit to do whatever you can of serving him and taking care of him.</p>\n<p>We understand that you are working outside the home during your pregnancy; there is no doubt that serving your husband and taking care of your health takes precedence over that. If you are not able to combine work and taking care of your house, then take leave from your work and focus on your house and husband during this period.</p>\n<p>If that is not possible because of your circumstances, then hire someone to help you with the housework and use some of your salary to help you with that.</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to set your affairs straight and to help you to treat your husband kindly and to reconcile between you.</p>\n<p>To learn more, review these answers:&nbsp;(<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/69960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">69960</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/88353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">88353</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9602</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10680</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1704</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/191975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">191975</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/111964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">111964</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/214222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">214222</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/119767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">119767</a>)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.” [17:85]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim should strive to learn more about that which has an impact on his own behaviour, such as knowledge of Allah, His names and attributes, what he is obliged to believe in and knowledge of the rulings of sharee’ah (Islamic law). He should avoid delving deeply into matters which he is not required to know and in which there is no benefit. I ask Allah to grant us beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds.<br>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
