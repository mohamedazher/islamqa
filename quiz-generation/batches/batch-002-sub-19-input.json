      "title": "Her nifaas is intermittent and the bleeding is very light. Should she fast?",
      "question": "<p>I gave birth to my daughter at the beginning of the seventh month (of pregnancy), but my daughter died. This is the decree of Allah. I bled heavily for around five days, and after that the bleeding became intermittent. Blood would come once a day, sometimes it would be very little and sometimes it would be heavy. The month of Ramadan began ten days after I gave birth. Every day, before Fajr, I do ghusl and intend to fast, and some days there is blood and some days there is not. Are the fasts that I have observed regarded as valid? Is there a specific timespan for nifaas, before which it is not permitted to do ghusl? I hope you will respond, because I am very confused, and I really want to fast the holy month. May Allah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The bleeding that occurs with childbirth is called nifaas (post-partum bleeding).</p>\n<p>There is no minimum limit for nifaas. It may last for ten days or for a week, or less than that. The maximum limit of nifaas is forty days according to the more correct scholarly opinion.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/10488\">10488</a>.</p>\n<p>The end of menses can be determined by one of two signs:</p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Emission of the white discharge, which is well-known to women.</p>\n<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Complete dryness, so that if a piece of cotton or the like is inserted into that place, it comes out clean with no trace of blood or yellow on it.</p>\n<p>If you see one of the two signs, then you should do ghusl, pray and fast. If the bleeding stops but there is not complete dryness, then this means that nifaas is still ongoing. If it lasts for more than forty days, then this is istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding), unless it coincides with the usual time of your period, in which case it is menses.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who saw the blood of nifaas for two weeks, then it gradually turned into mucus that was yellowish in colour, and it continued like that until the end of the forty days. Do the rulings on nifaas apply to this discharge that followed the bleeding, or not?</p>\n<p>He replied: With regard to this yellowish discharge or mucus, so long as no clear signs of purity (i.e., the end of nifaas) appear in it, it comes under the same rulings as the blood nifaas. So the woman is not pure until this ends.</p>\n<p>End quote from  Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, p. 304.</p>\n<p>Based on that, so long as the bleeding has not ceased completely, you are still in nifaas, so it is not valid for you to fast.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>There is a charitable foundation that collects money (charity and zakah) and does charitable work, but it holds religious competitions, such as competitions in memorising Quran and Sunnah, in which the winner is given a cash prize so as to encourage him. This prize comes from zakah wealth; is that permissible or not?.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>We know that Holy Prophet's()father name was Abdullah &amp; he had passed away before Prophet's birth.With this background please tell that what was the concept in arabs about \"ALLAH\"before prophet.Were they familiar to this word before prophet's birth?How did they differentiate Allah from idols,if at all they did?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>You should note that Arabian societies before Islam were not atheistic societies that denied the existence of Allah, or societies that were unaware that there is a Lord, Creator and Provider. They knew that, and they still retained some traces of the religion of Ibraaheem, and they had contact with Jews and Christians. But their problem was that they did not worship Allah Alone in exclusion to others; they had other gods whom they associated in worship with Him, and which they worshipped not on the basis that they were the Lord, the Creator the Provider, but because they claimed that these were intermediaries who would intercede between them and Allah and bring them closer to Allah. Hence Allah said concerning them (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And if you (O Muhammad) ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth,’ they will certainly say: ‘Allah’” [Luqmaan 31:25]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This indicates that they acknowledged that Allah is the Creator.

      "title": "His sacrificial animal fell and he slaughtered it before it died; does it still count as a sacrifice?",
      "question": "<p>The sacrificial animal fell from the roof of our house and we slaughtered it before it died; is that permissible?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It appears from your question that you slaughtered the sacrificial animal before the Eid prayer. If that is the case, then it is not a sacrifice (udhiyah), because the condition of the sacrifice is that it should be slaughtered on the days of sacrifice, which are the day of Eid and the three following days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Jundub ibn Sufyaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was present on Eid al-Adha with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When he had finished leading the people in prayer, he looked at a sheep that had been slaughtered and said, ‘Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the prayer, let him slaughter a sheep in place of it, and whoever has not yet slaughtered (his sacrifice), let him do so in the name of Allah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 942; Muslim, 1960.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on this, if this sacrifice was in fulfilment of a vow, then you have to offer another sacrifice in its stead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if you slaughtered it at the time of sacrifice, and you bought it with the intention of sacrificing it, then it is valid and is a sacrifice (udhiyah), even if it was damaged as the result of its fall from the roof. See also question no. (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39191\" target=\"_blank\">39191</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the validity of your slaughtering it, it is valid if you managed to do it before it died.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has forbidden that which has been killed by strangling, and that which has been killed by a violent blow – which is an animal that dies from a blow with a piece of wood or metal – and that which has been killed by a headlong fall – like your sacrifice – and that which has been partially eaten by wild animals. This applies if the animal dies, but if people catch up with it before it dies and slaughter it in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, then it becomes halaal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al‑Maitah (the dead animals — cattle — beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns — and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal — unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death)”&nbsp;[al-Maa’idah 5:3]</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The phrase “unless you are able to slaughter it” refers to that which you are able to reach and slaughter in the proper manner when there is still evidently life in it. That refers to the phrase, “that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns — and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/11, 12&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ka’b ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that they had sheep that used to graze at Sal’ (a mountain in Madeenah): a girl of ours saw a sheep that was dying, so she broke a stone and slaughtered it with it. He said to them: “Do not eat it until I ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” He asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that and he told him to eat it.

If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)} [At-Tawbah 9:65-66]</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_obligation_to_denounce_mockery_of_Islam\">The obligation to denounce mockery of Islam</span></h3>\n<p>What the one who is present in such a gathering must do is denounce that. If he cannot do that, then he must leave the gathering, so that he will not be a partner in the sin. If he expresses any kind of approval of their actions and words, then he is like them. Allah, may He be Exalted, Says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And when you (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic.

Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.} [An-Nisa’ 4:140]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, regards the one who sits in a gathering and witnesses evil, if he does not denounce it, as being like the one who does or speaks that evil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence it is said that the one who listens is the partner of the one who backbites. According to a report, the one who witnesses sin but hates it is like the one who was absent from it, and the one who was absent from it but approves of it is like the one who witnessed it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>When some of them made fun of (the believers) and said concerning those with whom Allah is pleased, “We have never seen anyone like our people who are well-versed in the Quran when it comes to eating more or telling more lies or being more cowardly when meeting the enemy,” Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{The hypocrites fear lest a Surah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: \"(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’</p>\n<p>If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: `Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking?</p>\n<p>Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)} [Al-Tawbah 9:66]</p>\n<p>Allah informed them that they had disbelieved after having believed, even though they said, “We say words of disbelief without believing in them; rather we were just talking idly and joking.” He explained that mocking the revelations of Allah constitutes disbelief, and such words cannot be uttered except by someone who is content with such words, for if he had faith in his heart, it would have prevented him from saying such words.

Islam has only told us of these things so as to alarm people and set their hearts straight, so that they will not persist in heedlessness. One of the greatest forms of heedlessness, which is indicative of being overwhelmed by ignorance, whims and desires, and lack of insight, is when one regards matters of exhortation and admonition as a joke and something to be laughed at and made fun of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning these hypocrites who make fun of Islam:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates that they did not themselves think that they had committed an act of disbelief; rather they thought that that did not constitute disbelief. So Allah explained that ridiculing Allah and His revelations and His Messenger constituted disbelief and meant that the person had disbelieved after having believed. This indicates that they had faith, albeit weak, and they did this prohibited action knowing that it was prohibited, but they did not think that it constituted disbelief. However it was kufr by means of which they became disbelievers, although they did not think that it was permissible. (End quote from <em>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</em>, 7/273)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The one who falls into such error must renew his faith by uttering the Shahadatayn (two declarations of faith) and repent sincerely from what he has done. As for the Shahadatayn, uttering it in the prayer or in the rituals of `Umrah is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Kashshaf Al-Qina` </em>(6/181):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the disbeliever prays or gives the Adhan (call to prayer), he is deemed to be a Muslim, regardless of whether he was originally a disbeliever or had apostatised.

He must repent and must believe that he is repenting from apostasy. So he must renew his Islam, for the revelations of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and His Messenger, are too great to be mocked or ridiculed. (End quote from <em>Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh</em>, 60/12)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What you have mentioned about your friends is no excuse for you not to alert them to the serious sin that they have committed; rather what you must do is tell them about the ruling on what they have done, so that they may repent to Allah, may He be Exalted, from it, and they may regret it and be careful not to go back to it again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can read this message to them, as an answer to your question, and similar answers having to do with the Islamic ruling on that.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/102871\" target=\"_blank\">102871</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/275500\" target=\"_blank\">275500</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He committed zina with a married woman who was estranged from her husband; can he marry her if her husband divorces her?",
      "question": "<p>There is a woman who was abused by her husband who was an alcoholic, so therefore, she left her country to come to North America. She thought she was divorced automatically because someone told her that fact she was away from her husband for one year, she becomes automatically divorced. She met a muslim man at work and he confirmed to her that she indeed was not divorced, in her situation. As they got to know each other, they fell in love and even committed zina. Finally, the woman got her divorce papers, and completed her iddah period. During the iddah, both man and woman stopped seeing each other, and felt remorse and guilt for their sins, and made taubah and repented to Allah. Theyre planning on getting married soon inshaAllah, so I wanted to know if their marriage is valid? I heard that there are a few scholars of the Maliki maddab who say that a man who spoils the marital status of a woman is not allowed to marry that woman. But most scholars have agreed that this marriage would still be valid. And the man is not sure if he falls under this category because the woman already had intention to divorce before she met him. Also, the man is of Hanafi school thought and the woman is of Shafii if this helps. Even though the majority of scholars say that marriage is valid, I wanted to be clear and know the correct view inshaAllah if they may marry and worship Allah throughout their halal marriage. Please advise.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a woman leaves her husband or a man leaves his wife for one or two years, or for more or less time than that, the marriage remains valid until the man actually divorces his wife. So long as that has not happened, and the man has not uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) to his wife, or has not written words to that effect with the intention of divorcing her, then the woman is still his wife, even if the separation has gone on for a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When is a woman regarded as divorced? He said: The woman is regarded as divorced if her husband issues a divorce (talaaq) to her when he is of sound mind and does so by choice, with no impediment to divorce such as insanity, intoxication and the like, and the woman is pure (i.e., not menstruating), during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her, or she is pregnant or postmenopausal.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fataawa at-Talaaq, 1/35&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11681\">11681</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zina (fornication or adultery) is one of the major sins; the degree of sin is worse and the punishment is multiplied if the woman is married, because that is a betrayal of her husband … Hence the punishment for an unmarried zaani is one hundred lashes, and the punishment for a previously married zaani is stoning to death.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)”</p>\n<p>Al-Isra’ 17:32].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibition on approaching it or coming near it is more eloquent than merely prohibiting the action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that may lead to it or promote it, because the one who approaches a forbidden area will soon find himself wandering in it, especially in the case of this matter which is very tempting for many people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah described zina and its abhorrent nature as a “faashishah” (something that transgresses its limits); in other words it is a sin that is regarded as immoral and odious in terms of sharee‘ah, rational thought and sound human nature, because it implies transgression of the sacred limits with regard to the rights of Allah, the rights of the woman and the rights of her family or husband, betrayal of marriage, confusion of lineage, and other negative consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The words “and an evil way” mean: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to commit this grave sin.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tafseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan, 1/457&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What they must both do is repent sincerely, turn back to Allah and keep away from the things that lead to zina. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on the crime of zina and repentance therefrom, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/47924\">47924</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/138270\">138270</a></p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that it is not permissible for the zaani to marry the zaaniyah until after they have repented sincerely, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a Mushrikah and the adulteress none marries her except an adulterer or a Muskrik (and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater, etc.) And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress, etc.)). Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”</p>\n<p>[an-Noor 24:3].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Repentance is attained by regretting (what one has done) and resolving not to go back to the sin. So long as they have repented and regretted what they fell into of sin, it is valid for them to marry according to most of the scholars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a woman commits zina, it is not permissible for the one who knows of that to marry her unless two conditions are met:</p>\n<p>1.That her ‘iddah has ended</p>\n<p>2.That she has repented from zina.</p>\n<p>If these two conditions are met, it is permissible for the zaani or anyone else to marry her, according to the opinion of most of the scholars, including Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Jaabir, Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab, Tawoos, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, ‘Ikrimah, az-Zuhri, ath-Thawri, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ibn al-Mundhir, and ashaab ar-ra’y.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood, al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib and ‘Aa’ishah that she is not permissible (in marriage) for the zaani under any circumstances. They said: They are still zaanis whenever they are together, because of the general meaning of the verse and the report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be that what they meant by that was the period before they repent or before it is established that she is not pregnant, in which case it is the same as our view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to it being forbidden in absolute terms, that is not correct, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property” [an-Nisa’ 4:24].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because she is permissible (in marriage) for someone other than the one who committed zina with her, she is also permissible to him, like any other woman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni, 7/108.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to turn a woman against her husband because that leads to the breakup of families, even if there was a bitter dispute between the spouses. Some scholars regarded this as a major sin. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who turns a woman against her husband.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2175; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (5170) also narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever turns a man’s wife or slave against him is not one of us.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whoever turns a woman against her husband” (means) by mentioning the husband’s bad qualities to his wife, or mentioning the good qualities of another man to her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 6/159&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he said “Whoever turns a man’s wife” means: he deceives her and corrupts her, or makes the idea of divorce attractive to her so that he or someone else can marry her, and so on.</p>\n<p>‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 14/52&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our shaykh, ash-Sha‘raawi, said: That also includes the case where a woman who is angry with her husband comes to him so that he can reconcile between them, for example, so he offers her abundant food and wants to spend on her and honour her, even if that is in order to honour her husband, then her heart may be inclined to someone else and she starts to look down on her husband. This is also included in this hadeeth. The wise man should be careful with regard to such matters, even if his intention is good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: I did this several times; I put pressure on the woman who was angry with her husband, and I advised my family to leave her hungry, so that she would go back and would appreciate how blessed she was with her husband.</p>\n<p>End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ al-Kabeer, 6/159&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person turns a woman against her husband and spoils her for him so that she leaves him, then he marries her, his marriage is not valid and they must be separated, according to the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). This is also the view of the Maalikis. For more information on the ruling on this issue and what is meant by turning a woman against her husband, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/84849\">84849</a></p>\n<p>Based on the above, if this man is the one who turned the woman against her husband, so that she would get divorced for his sake, it is not permissible for him to marry her, especially when he has committed zina with her. There is a difference of opinion concerning marriage of the zaani to the woman with whom he committed zina. In this case he has combined two evils: turning a woman against her husband and zina.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he is not the one who turned her against her husband, as appears to be the case from the question, and he only got to know her and meet her after she had left her husband and she had left his house, then his marriage to her is valid, if she has got divorced from her first husband, on condition that they both repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from what occurred between them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

Those! They are the truthful.” [al-Hujurat 49:15]</p>\n<p>A condition of their being truthful in their belief in Allah and His Messenger is that they should not doubt. The one who doubts is a hypocrite – Allah forbid.</p>\n<p>It is reported in al-Sahih that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, for no person meets Allah with these two (words), not doubting in them, and is kept away from Paradise.”</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Acceptance\"><strong>Acceptance</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means that one accepts with one’s heart and with one’s words that which is implied by this kalimah. Allah says concerning the one who accepts it (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Save the chosen slaves of Allah (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism). For them there will be a known provision (in Paradise), Fruits; and they shall be honoured,</p>\n<p>In the Gardens of Delight (Paradise)…” [al-Saffat 37:40-43]</p>\n<p>“Whoever brings a good deed (i.e. belief in the Oneness of Allah along with every deed of righteousness), will have better than its worth; and they will be safe from the terror on that Day.” [al-Naml 27:89]</p>\n<p>It was narrated in al-Sahih from Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“The likeness of the guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is a great deal of rain which falls on the land. Some of the land is fertile: it absorbs the water and brings forth a lot of grass and vegetation. Other parts of the land are infertile, but they hold the water and Allah benefits the people thereby, so that they drink it, and water their animals and irrigate their lands with it. A third part of the land is plains which do not hold the water and where no plants grow. This is like the person who understands the religion of Allah and benefits from the Message with which Allah sent me, so he learns and teaches others (what he has learned), and the person who does not pay attention or accept the guidance of Allah with which I was sent.”</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Submission\"><strong>Submission</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49016\" target=\"_blank\">submitting</a> to what is implied by the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/378\" target=\"_blank\">Shahadah</a> , as opposed to ignoring or neglecting it.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islam).” [al-Zumar 39:54]</p>\n<p>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allah (i.e. follows Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer.” [al-Nisa 4:125]</p>\n<p>“And whosoever submits his face (himself) to Allah, while he is a Muhsin (good-doer, i.e. performs good deeds totally for Allah’s sake without any show-off or to gain praise or fame and does them in accordance with the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger Muhammad), then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)]. And to Allah return all matters for decision.” [Luqman 31:22]</p>\n<p>“submits his face” means, he submits fully. “While he is a muhsin (good-doer)” means he affirms the Unity of Allah.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Truthfulness_true_belief\"><strong>Truthfulness, true belief</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means, meaning what you say, as opposed to lying. This means <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2424\">saying it from the heart</a> , where the heart agrees with the words being uttered.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Alif Lam Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)…” [al-'Ankabut 29:1-3]</p>\n<p>In al-Sahihayn, it was narrated from Mu'adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There is no one who bears witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, truly from his heart, but Allah will protect him from the Fire.”</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Sincerity\"><strong>Sincerity</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/240287\" target=\"_blank\">purity of action</a> with a sound intention, free from any contamination of shirk. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only.” [al-Zumar 39:3]</p>\n<p>“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)…” [al-Bayyinah98:5]</p>\n<p>In al-Sahih, it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people who will be most deserving of my intercession will be those who say La ilaha ill-Allah sincerely from their hearts or their souls.”</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Love\"><strong>Love</strong></span></h4>\n<p>This means love for this word and for what it implies, and its people, those who act upon it and adhere to its conditions; and hatred of whatever goes against it.</p>\n<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else).” [al-Baqarah 2:165]</p>\n<p>The sign that a person loves his Lord is that he gives priority to what Allah loves even if it goes against his own desires, and he hates what Allah hates, even if it is something to which he is inclined. He takes as friends those who are friends of Allah and His Messenger and he takes as enemies those who are the enemies of Allah and His Messenger. He follows His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), follows in his footsteps and accepts his guidance .All of these signs are conditions of this love, and it cannot be imagined that this love can exist without any of these conditions.</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>\n<p>“There are three things which if a person finds them, he has found the sweetness of faith: when Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than all else; when he loves a person for no other reason than for the sake of Allah; and when he hates to return to kufr after Allah has saved him from it as he would hate to be thrown into fire.” (Narrated from the hadith of Anas ibn Malik)</p>\n<p>Some scholars added an eighth condition, which is the rejection of all things that are worshipped instead of Allah (al-kufr bi’l-taghut or rejection of false gods).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says La ilaha ill-Allah and rejects everything that is worshipped instead of Allah, his property and his blood will be sacred [i.e., it is forbidden to seize his property or shed his blood] and his reckoning will be with Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim)</p>\n<p>In order for his property and his blood to be protected, he must, in addition to saying La ilaha ill-Allah, also reject whatever is worshipped instead of Allah, no matter who or what it is.</p>\n<p>For more, please please see these answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11819\" target=\"_blank\">11819</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/114\" target=\"_blank\">114</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2585\" target=\"_blank\">2585</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>    It is haraam for the Muslim to organize parties or festivals     that include haraam things, such as singing and music, mixing of men and     women, and bringing charlatan magicians, because there is a great deal of     shar’i evidence that indicates that such things are haraam and they are     causes of people falling into that which Allaah has forbidden of immoral and     evil actions. Allaah warns those who want immorality to be spread among the     believers and promote that, and He has prepared a painful punishment for     them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, those who     like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated     among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and     in the Hereafter” [al-Noor 24:18]. Once it is established that these     parties and festivals are haraam, it is also haraam to attend them, because     they are a waste of time and money in things that are not pleasing to     Allaah, and they are cooperating in sin and transgression, and Allaah says     (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and     At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in     sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in     punishment” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. And in a hadeeth the authenticity of     which is agreed upon, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be     upon him) forbade wasting money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah is the source of strength.

Imam Muslim (1214) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr who said: I was told that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer sitting is half a prayer.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: I came to him and found him <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50180\" target=\"_blank\">praying sitting down</a> . I put my hand on his head and he said: “What is the matter with you, O ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I said: O Messenger of Allah, I was told that you said: “A man’s prayer sitting is half a prayer,” but you are praying sitting down? He said: “Yes, but I am not like one of you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he prays sitting down because of an excuse, he will have the reward of one who prays standing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What is meant is: the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/67934\" target=\"_blank\">prayer of one who sits down whilst praying</a> is half the reward of the one who prays standing. This implies that it is valid but its reward is reduced. This hadith is to be understood as referring to offering nafl prayers when one is able to stand; he will have half the reward of one who prays standing. But if a person offers a nafl prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, his reward will not be reduced; rather he will have the same reward as one who prays standing. But with regard to the obligatory prayer, if a person prays sitting when he is able to stand, it is not valid and he will not have any reward for it; rather he is sinning by doing that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our companions said: if he regards doing that as permissible, this is disbelief and the rulings on apostates apply to him, as is the case if he regards zina, riba and other known haram things as permissible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he offers an obligatory prayer sitting because he is unable to stand, or he does so lying down because he is unable to stand or sit, then his reward will be like that of one who prays standing and it will not be reduced, according to the consensus of our companions. Thus the hadith is to be understood as discussing the issue of reward for one who offers a <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/109254\" target=\"_blank\">nafl prayer</a> sitting when he is able to stand. This is our point of view in detail and it is the view of the majority with regard to the interpretation of this hadith.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “I am not like one of you,” according to our companions this is one of the unique characteristics of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); his nafl prayer offered sitting when he was able to stand was like his nafl prayer offered standing as an honour to him, as he was also singled out for things that are well known in the books of our companions and others, which I have listed at the beginning of my book Tahdhib al-Asma wa’l-Lughat.” (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 6/14)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_you_pray_tarawih_while_sitting\">Can you pray tarawih while sitting?</span></h3>\n<p>Based on that, you can say the opening takbir standing and then sit, or you may say the opening takbir whilst sitting, then when you feel more energetic you can get up, and this is better and preferable. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray at night, and when he got tired he would sit down, then when he was going to bow, he would get up and bow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I did not see the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reciting in any night prayer whilst sitting until he grew old, then he would recite whilst sitting, and when there were thirty or forty verses left of the surah, he would stand up and recite them, then he would bow. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1148) and Muslim, 731)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This indicates that it is permissible in the same rak`ah to stand for part of it and sit for part of it. This is our opinion and the opinion of Malik, Abu Hanifah and most of the scholars. It is the same whether one stands then sits, or sits then stands. Some of the early scholars disallowed that, but that is extreme. Al-Qadi narrated from Abu Yusuf and Muhammad, the two companions of Abu Hanifah, among others, that it is makruh to sit after standing, but if the person intended to stand, then he wanted to sit down, that is permissible in our view and that of the majority. Among the Malikis, Ibn al-Qasim regarded it as permissible and Ashhab disallowed it.”</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Should one who joined the prayer late repeat the prostration of forgetfulness if he did it with the imam?",
      "question": "<p>If a person joined the prayer late and the imam had made a mistake and did the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam or before it, should he do the prostration of forgetfulness again after he completes his prayer? Can the prostration of forgetfulness be done twice?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If the imam makes a mistake and does the prostration of     forgetfulness before the salaam, the one who joined the prayer late has to     follow him, because he is connected to his imam until he says the salaam.     Then when he makes up whatever he missed, he must prostrate again, because     his prostration with the imam was not done at the right point in the prayer.     The prostration of forgetfulness cannot be done during the prayer, rather     his prostrating with the imam was only because he was following the imam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam’s mistake occurred before the latecomer     joined the prayer, then he should not repeat the prostration, because the     ruling on his imam’s mistake does not apply to him, as it happened before he     joined him in prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam does the prostration of forgetfulness after     the salaam, then the latecomer should not prostrate with him, because     following the imam in this case is not possible except by saying the salaam     with him, and the latecomer cannot do that, as he does not say the salaam     until after he has completed his prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if the imam’s mistake came before he joined him, then he     does not have to do the prostration of forgetfulness, because the ruling on     his imam’s mistake does not apply to him. But if his mistake came after he     joined him, then he should prostrate after he has said the salaam. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of the argument we have mentioned above is based on     sound reports, such as the idea that the one who is praying behind the imam     should prostrate following his imam, because the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The imam is only appointed to be     followed.” Agreed upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And some of it is based on sound rational thinking, as     explained. See: al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala al-Muqni’ and al-Majmoo’     Sharh al-Muhadhdhab. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n",
