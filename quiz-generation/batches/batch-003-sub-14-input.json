      "title": "Is this expression correct?",
      "question": "<p>Is there anything wrong with this expression: “If we knew what was going to happen in the future we could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble”?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>What this expression means if that if a person knew what was going to happen to him, which is a matter of the unseen, he would have been able to avoid the problems and evil that have befallen him. This is in accordance with the Muslim’s belief (‘aqeedah), and there is nothing wrong with it, because the unknown is something that is known only to Allaah. If it were the case that people could see the unseen and know of events before they happen, they would have achieved everything good and avoided everything bad. They would look at the causes of good health, wealth and happiness and they would pursue them, and they would look at the causes of poverty, disease and death and they would avoid them. But this is something hypothetical and impossible. The point is that man is incapable and weak and must submit to the fate that Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, has decreed for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe’”</p>\n<p>[al-A’raaf 7:188]</p>\n<p>It says in Tafseer al-Qur’aan il-‘Azeem (3/524):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best comment concerning this is what was narrated by al-Dahhaak from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “If I had knowledge of the unseen I would have acquired a lot of good” i.e., wealth. According to another report: “If I knew the unseen I would have known what would make a profit and what would not, and I would have made a lot of money and poverty would not have come my way.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Jareer said: Others said: What that means is: If I had knowledge of the unseen I would have prepared for the year of drought (by setting side something) from the year of plenty, and I would have known when prices were about to go up or down, so I would have saved for myself from the times when prices were low for the times when prices were high.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said: “and no evil should have touched me” I would have avoided evil before it happened. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Sa’di said in Tafseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan (p. 311): “If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me” means: I would have done the things that I know would have resulted in good and benefits for me, and I would have avoided everything that could lead to evil and negative consequences, because I would have known about things before they happened, and I would have known what they would lead to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But – because of my lack of such knowledge – bad things may happen to me, and I may miss out on good things. This is the clearest evidence that I have no knowledge of the unseen.

      "title": "The same conditions are stipulated for the ‘aqeeqah as for the udhiyah: the animal should have reached the right age and should be free of defects",
      "question": "<p>I have two daughters. The older one is six years old and the other is three years old. I wanted to do the ‘aqeeqah for the older one, so I got in touch with the butcher and he bought a ram for me for four hundred dollars, but the butcher did not know that it was an ‘aqeeqah, so he slaughtered it in the slaughterhouse and brought it to me already cut into pieces. But I had intended to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah and distribute the meat raw to relatives and the poor. Is it permissible to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah in the slaughterhouse or must it be slaughtered at home, and does the name of the one for whom the ‘aqeeqah is being offered have to be mentioned, as in the case of the udhiyah? If that is not permissible, is it permissible to regard that ram as charity, and buy another ram and slaughter it? If I have to offer another ‘aqeeqah, is it permissible for me to buy two lamb instead of one ram, because the price of one ram is equivalent to that of two lambs, and then can I slaughter them for my two daughters at the same time?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>In order for the ‘aqeeqah or udhiyah to valid, it is not stipulated that the name of the one who is offering the udhiyah or ‘aqeeqah be mentioned over it. It is also not stipulated that they be slaughtered at home; in fact it is acceptable for them to be slaughtered in a country other than the country of the one who is offering the udhiyah or the child for whom the ‘aqeeqah is offered.</p>\n<p>What matters is that the one who offers it intends that it be an udhiyah or ‘aqeeqah. It is not stipulated that the slaughterman or butcher be aware that it is an ‘aqeeqah or udhiyah. Based on that, that ram was acceptable as an ‘aqeeqah for your older daughter.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is not essential to offer a particular type of livestock for the ‘aqeeqah. Either a male or female sheep is acceptable, and so is a lamb or goat. That is because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “For a boy, two sheep, and for a girl, one sheep, and it does not matter whether they are male or female.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1516); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>But in the case of the ‘aqeeqah, the same rulings are stipulated as for the udhiyah, that the animal should be free of defects and of the right age.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The same defects should be avoided in the case of [the ‘aqeeqah] as in the case of the udhiyah. To sum up: the rulings on the ‘aqeeqah are the same as the rulings on the udhiyah with regard to the age of the animal, and the same defects are to be avoided … So it is not acceptable to offer anything less than a six-month-old sheep or a one-year-old goat (i.e. it is in its second year), and it is not permissible to offer a one-eyed animal that is obviously one-eyed, or a lame animal that is obviously lame, or a sick animal that is obviously sick, or an extremely emaciated animal, or a mutilated animal that has lost more than half of its ear or horn. End quote from al-Mughni (7/366).</p>\n<p>The acceptable age for an ‘aqeeqah is five years in the case of a camel, two years in the case of a cow, one year in the case of a goat and six months in the case of a sheep.</p>\n<p>Based on that, you do not have to slaughter that which is most expensive. What matters is that the ‘aqeeqah be an animal that would be acceptable as an udhiyah, meaning that it has reached the right age and that it is free of defects.</p>\n<p>The ‘aqeeqah that you are going to offer later, in sha Allah, will only be for the younger daughter. As for the older daughter, we have explained above that the ram that was slaughtered was acceptable for her ‘aqeeqah.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/41899\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">41899</a> and <a href=\"/en/answers/82607\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">82607</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I worked for several years at the university from which I graduated as a teaching assistant on the basis of payment for each lecture I gave. Whilst I was working the university offered free study for diplomas in languages and computing, so as to raise the academic standard of the university. I was nominated to study for these diplomas and I started to study from that time. … This year I did not sign a teaching contract but I am still studying for this diploma, and I intend to go back to teaching next year if a suitable timetable is available to me. … I heard from one of my colleagues that the university does not allow anyone who is not working for it to study for these diplomas, but I have not heard anything official from the university…. The list came out this year and I looked at it after it was updated, and my name is still there. … Is it permissible for me to complete the studies for this diploma? What should I do?.</p>\n",

      "title": "He is suffering from bleeding and blot clots in the brain – does he have to fast?",
      "question": "<p>My wife’s father is suffering from bleeding and blood clots in the brain, may Allaah heal us and you. He cannot move and he is totally paralyzed, but he may be able to lift a cup of water with help to drink, then he will continue to hold the cup for an hour if we forget him, because he does not realize that he has finished drinking. His memory is almost gone. The doctors are unanimously agreed that there is no cure except with Allaah. He has been in the situation and getting worse for six years, praise be to Allaah, and he cannot do without daily medicine and natural remedies. This is costing them thousands every month. He has not prayed since then and he has to be carried to the bathroom, and for a year or more he has had a catheter and he has no control over his urine or stools, and he cannot even signal to us that he needs tog o to the bathroom, no matter how hard we try to teach him to let us know by giving us some signal. He can hardly talk and he does not understand anything but he knows our faces and is moved when he hears sad stories, for example. We have tried to help him pray even if it is by moving his eyes, but he does not understand and he does not remember the verses and the tashahhud and the number of rak’ahs in each obligatory prayer. Does he have to offer any expiation for not praying? Or for not fasting in particular? Does he come under the heading of the sick whose families must offer the expiation for not fasting by feeding one poor person for every day? Or does he come under the heading of the insane or mentally disabled who have no understanding, so fasting and prayer are waived for them?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    If     his memory is gone and his mind has changed so that he is not aware of     things, then fasting and prayer are waived in his case, and he does not have     to offer any expiation, because one of the conditions of being accountable     is that one should be of sound mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The     Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Pen has     been lifted from three: from the sleeping person until he wakes up, from the     minor until he grows up, and from the insane person until he comes to his     senses.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4403), al-Tirmidhi (1423), al-Nasaa’i     (3432) and Ibn Majaah (2041). Abu Dawood said: It was narrated by Ibn Jurayj     from al-Qaasim ibn Yazeed from ‘Ali from the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he added:&nbsp; “and the old man who is     feeble-minded.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This     hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It     says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood:&nbsp; “the old man who is feeble-minded”; this     refers to when the mind becomes weak in old age. Al-Subki said: This implies     that it is additional to the three (mentioned in the hadeeth), and this is     correct. What is meant is the old man who has lost his mind due to old age,     because an old man may become confused which prevents him from     distinguishing things, and means that he is no longer accountable, but it is     not called insanity and it does not say in the hadeeth “until he comes to     his senses,” because in most cases he will not recover from this before he     dies, and if he recovers for some of the time and comes back to his senses,     then he is accountable for that time… End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See:    al-Ashbaah wa’l-Nazaa’ir by al-Suyooti, p. 212&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Fasting is not     obligatory unless certain conditions are met: </p>\n<p>    1-        Being of sound mind</p>\n<p>    2-        Being an adult</p>\n<p>    3-        Being a Muslim</p>\n<p>    4-        Being able to do it</p>\n<p>    5-        Being a resident (i.e., not     travelling)</p>\n<p>    6-        Being free of menses and     nifaas in the case of women</p>\n<p>    1 –     Being of sound mind, the opposite of which is losing one's mind or reason,     whether that is due to senile dementia i.e., old age, or an accident which     has caused a person to lose his mind and awareness. This person does not     have to do anything, because of his loss of reason. Like the one who has     reached old age and reached the point of senility, he does not have to fast     or feed the poor, because he has lost his mind. The same applies to one who     is unconscious as the result of an accident or other cause; he does not have     to fast or feed the poor, because he is not aware. End quote from Liqa’     al-Baab il-Maftooh (4/220).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He     also said: The one who has lost his mind as the result of old age or an     accident and there is no hope of recovery, is not obliged to fast, like the     one who has reached a great age and become senile and can no longer speak     properly. He is like a child and is not obliged to fast. The same applies to     one who has had an accident and lost his mind in a way from which there is     no hope of recovery. But if there is the hope of recovery, such as if he is     merely unconscious, then he has to make up the fasts when he wakes up, but     if he has lost his mind completely then he does not have to fast, i.e., if     he does not have to fast then he does not have to offer the fidyah either.     End quote from Sharh al-Kaafi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What     appears to be the case is that he does not have to pray or fast, and there     is no need to feed the poor on his behalf instead of fasting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And     Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": " He speaks improperly with a woman, with the excuse that he is teaching her",
      "question": "<p>I am a girl who has been on the Internet for a short time, but I have noticed that some people are very confused and they mix truth with falsehood. From the way some of them speak, they appear to be good and pious, but some of the things they do are very strange.<br />\n When I first starting going on the Internet, some of the sites I went to were chat rooms. I admit that this was a mistake on my part, but I have put matters right, alhamdu-Lillaah. I stopped going into chat rooms two weeks after I started. But whilst I was visiting chat rooms I got to know a man who, from what he says, appears to be righteous and pious, and keen to pursue good. He tries to put right whatever he can, and he sends out letters containing words of religious exhortation by e-mail to everyone he knows. He goes into chat rooms on the basis of the belief and principle that he adheres to, which is that good people should be present in these sites, in which there are a lot of bad people, in order to crowd out the bad people.<br />\n The main thing is that I stopped going to the chat rooms, but I continued to communicate with him by e-mail. He was trying to persuade me that I had to go to the chat rooms in order to reform the women, because women are closer to other women, especially on sites where there are so many women that the “wolves” are tempted to come and “hunt” them. I did not respond to his request because I knew how damaging it is to go to those sites where the evil outweighs the good. The way he spoke to me in his letters was very respectful and he was very selective in the words he chose; I was equally careful in the way I spoke to him. This encouraged me to ask him to teach me the basics of the Internet via e-mail, or, if that was not possible, via “messenger”. He agreed to do that via “messenger” so we started the lessons, and he carried on being respectful and serious. But I noticed that sometimes he would joke or get carried away in talking about matters that had nothing to do with the lesson, which he called educational topics. And he also asked about some personal matters such as the city where I live, etc. I knew that he was in touch with a group of women with whom he discussed educational matters and the state of the Muslims, etc., and that these discussions might go on for hours. I did not like this state of affairs and I told him that frankly. I also told him that this joking was not permitted, and that he should be formal when speaking with women, and not use certain phrases. He quoted as evidence that it is permissible to speak with women the fact that the shaykhs answer questions from women; and he quoted as evidence that it is permissible to joke the hadeeth “No old women will enter Paradise” – meaning that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was joking with that old woman when he said that to her. He said that being too formal and reserved may lead to the opposite result. I was not convinced by his arguments, because from the little knowledge that I have, this is not permitted. I asked him to complete the lessons via e-mail and not to use the “messenger”, and until now he has not replied at all. I find it strange and wonder how he could do that when he has reached such a high level of knowledge and religious commitment, as well as being haafiz al-Qur’aan (i.e., he has memorized the Qur’aan by heart). I want to point out that this is a subtle trap that is one of the snares of the Shaytaan, by means of which he confuses people. What is the final word on this problem? Please excuse me for writing such a long question. May Allaah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>You should cut off all contact with this man immediately,           and make use of books and educational web-sites so that you will have           no need to consult him. Make sure that you yourself do not become a           means of misguiding a daa’iyah or haafiz in the first place by doing           something that is wrong. We ask Allaah to guide us, you and him, and           to make us all steadfast. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I want to ask about the definitively proven hadiths. As far as I understand, they are the reports concerning which there is no doubt that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said those words, so that we can quote them without having to mention the isnaad. Then I want to ask about the phrase that refers to the one-eyed liar, i.e., “al-maseeh al-dajjaal,” because the first word (al-maseeh) could make one think that this refers to ‘Eesa, but the second word (ad-dajjaal) refers to a liar. Please note that I know that this phrase is mentioned in al-Bukhaari.

Apart from that, their hadiths are definitively proven, according to the more correct scholarly view, because they are supported by corroborating evidence and because the fact that the ummah unanimously accepts them indicates that they are sound.</p>\n<p>Ibn as-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him), in his <em>Muqaddimah</em> (p. 28-29), is of the view that the hadiths of <em>as-Saheehayn</em> are definitively sound and we should be certain about them, because the ummah is unanimously agreed on the soundness of the hadiths of <em>as-Saheehayn</em>, and the ummah is protected from error in its consensus – apart from a few hadiths in <em>as-Saheehayn</em> which some of the scholars critiqued, such as ad-Daaraqutni and others.</p>\n<p>But an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) commented [on what Ibn as-Salaah said] in <em>at-Taqreeb</em>, where he said:</p>\n<p>The shaykh stated that whatever both of them [al-Bukhaari and Muslim] or one of them narrated is definitively sound, and we are certain about any of the knowledge acquired from them, but the scholars who specialized in hadith and the majority of scholars disagreed with him and said: The hadiths are probably sound (and not definitively sound), unless they are mutawaatir.\" (<em>Tadreeb ar-Raawi&nbsp;</em>1/141).</p>\n<p>A number of the scholars who specialized in hadith followed the view of Ibn as-Salaah and differed from an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him). As-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ibn ‘Abd as-Salaam criticized Ibn as-Salaah for this view.</p>\n<p>Al-Bulqeeni said: What an-Nawawi and Ibn ‘Abd as-Salaam said, and those who followed them in this view, is not to be accepted. Some later scholars of hadith narrated a view similar to that of Ibn as-Salaah from a number of Shaafa‘i scholars, such as Abu Ishaaq, Abu Haamid al-Isfaraayeeni, al-Qaadi Abu’t-Tayyib and Shaykh Abu Ishaaq ash-Shiraazi; and from as-Sarakhsi among the Hanafis; al-Qaadi ‘Abd al-Wahhaab among the Maalikis; Abu Ya‘la, Abu’l-Khattaab and Ibn az-Zaaghooni among the Hanbalis; Ibn Foorak and most of the scholars of kalaam among the Ash‘aris; and all the scholars of hadith. The view of all of the salaf (early generations) is that the hadith that is widely accepted among the ummah is definitively sound.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam – meaning Ibn Hajar – said: What an-Nawawi mentioned in Sharh Muslim was by way of claiming that the majority agreed with him. As for those who specialized in hadith, no [they did not agree with him]. There were many specialized scholars who also agreed with Ibn as-Salaah.</p>\n<p>He (i.e., al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar) said in <em>Sharh an-Nukhbah</em>: The report that is supported by corroborating evidence is definitively proven, contrary to the view of some. The definitively proven reports are of several types, including those which were narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their <em>Saheehayn</em> which did not reach the level of being mutawaatir, but there is other corroborating evidence which supports them.</p>\n<p>That evidence includes: the great knowledge of al-Bukhaari and Muslim in this field, and their preeminence in distinguishing sound hadiths, in which they excelled others, and the fact that the scholars accepted and embraced the books. This acceptance alone is stronger evidence to prove that their hadiths are definitively sound than the hadiths which were narrated through many isnaads but did not reach the level of being mutawaatir. But this [superiority of the hadiths in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>] is limited to the hadiths concerning which none of the scholars expressed any reservations. … Apart from [those few hadiths], there is consensus that we should accept that they [the hadiths in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>] are sound and embrace them.</p>\n<p>Ibn Katheer said: I agree with the view of Ibn as-Salaah.</p>\n<p>I (as-Suyooti) say: This is the view that I favour, and I have no other view concerning this issue.\" (<em>Tadreeb ar-Raawi</em>&nbsp; 1/142-145).</p>\n<p><u>The third type of hadiths which are definitively proven: those which the ummah unanimously accepts and embraces, even if they are not in <em>as-Saheehayn</em>,</u> because of what was noted above, that the ummah is protected from error in what it is unanimously agreed upon.</p>\n<p><u>The fourth type: the report which is widely circulated and is narrated through many isnaads which there is no problem.</u></p>\n<p>See: <em>an-Nukat ‘ala Kitaab Ibn as-Salaah</em>, by Ibn Hajar (1/378).</p>\n<p>Some of the scholars stated that the hadith which is narrated by a chain of narrators, all of whom are scholars of hadith – such as if Imam Ahmad narrated a hadith from Imam ash-Shaafa‘i, and ash-Shaafa‘i narrated it from Imam Maalik – this type of hadith is definitively sound and proven, because of the high calibre of its narrators. That is on condition that there should be more than one isnaad.</p>\n<p>See: <em>Tadreeb ar-Raawi</em> (1/144).</p>\n<p>All these types of hadith are definitively sound.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the mutawaatir report and the ahaad report that is supported by corroborating evidence on the basis of which it may be deemed to be definitive – such as that which the ummah accepted and embraced, whether it was in <em>as-Saheehayn</em> or in one of them, or it was narrated elsewhere – are to be regarded as definitively proven.</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The sound view is the view of the majority, that a report may be deemed to be definitively proven sometimes because of the large number of narrators, or because of the qualities of the narrators, such as their strong faith and religious commitment and their strong memory. And sometimes a report may be deemed to be definitively proven because of corroborating evidence that supports the report, because of which it may be deemed to be definitively proven. Also, the report that the ummah has accepted and believed to be true or acted in accordance with it is to be deemed definitively proven, according to the majority of later and earlier scholars. This is similar to that which is mutawaatir.\" (<em>Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa</em>&nbsp; 18/48).</p>\n<p>Based on the above, if a hadith is one of these types, there is nothing wrong with quoting it without an isnaad, but it is better to mention which of the authors of the books of hadith narrated it, such as al-Bukhaari, Muslim and Ahmad. You should also quote which of the scholars classed it as saheeh, so as to reassure the listener or reader of the soundness of this hadith.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/122507\" target=\"_blank\">122507</a> .</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with saying “al-maseeh ad-dajjaal,” because when the word al-maseeh (messiah) is used on its own, it refers to al-Maseeh ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (the Messiah Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him). But when using the phrase “al-maseeh ad-dajjaal,” it is known that this refers to someone else.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The word “al-maseeh” refers both to the Dajjaal and to ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), but if we are referring to the Dajjaal, we must specify that. End quote.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8806\" target=\"_blank\">8806</a> .</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is proven in more than one hadith that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) referred to the Dajjaal as “al-maseeh ad-dajjaal.” As this is proven from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) you should not have any doubts or hesitate to use this phrase.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Who was Dhu’th-Thudayyah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Dhuth-Thudayyah’s full name was Hurqoos ibn Zuhayr al-Bajali. He was one       of the Khawaarij (Khaarijites) who rebelled against Ameer al-Mu’mineen       ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), spread mischief in the land and shed       blood that it was forbidden to shed. ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him)       fought them at the battle of an-Nahrawand and killed them; none of them       escaped except a few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The     Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) urged the     believers to fight them. The first of them was Dhu’l-Khuwaysirah at-Tameemi,     who told the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him):     Be fair! And Dhu’th-Thudayyah was the last of them. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;He was a     very dark black man, who had a foul odour and a deformed arm; there was only     an upper arm, with no forearm, and at the end of his upper arm there was     something like a nipple on which there were some white hairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They (the     Khawaarij) are the ones concerning whom the Messenger of Allah (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him) said:     “Among the progeny of this man will be people who will recite     the Qur’an, but it will not go any further than their throats. They will     pass through Islam as an arrow passes through the prey. They will kill the     people of Islam and leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them,     then I will certainly kill them like ‘Aad (i.e., as ‘Aad were destroyed).”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Dhu’th-Thudayyah was the sign of these people; he was the sign of fitnah     (turmoil) and a symbol of mischief and evil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When ‘Ali     (may Allah be pleased with him) and the believers who were with him fought     them, he asked them to look for this man among the slain, and they found     him. ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and those who were with him     rejoiced greatly at that, and ‘Ali prostrated to Allah in gratitude.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>al-Bukhaari     (3610) and Muslim (1064) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be     pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was sharing out some     wealth, Dhu’l-Khuwaysirah, a man from Banu Tameem, came to him and said: O     Messenger of Allah, be fair! The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) said: “Woe to you! Who will be fair if I am not fair? You     will be doomed and lost if I am not fair.” ‘Umar said: O Messenger of Allah,     give me permission to strike his neck. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him be, for he has companions, in     comparison to whose prayer one of you would regard his prayer as     insignificant, and he would regard his fasting as insignificant in     comparison to their fasting. They recite the Qur’an but it does not go any     further than their collarbones. They will pass out of the faith as an arrow     passes out of the prey. Their sign will be a black man, one of whose upper     arms will be like a woman’s breast, or like a piece of quivering flesh. They     will emerge when there is division among the people.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Sa’eed     said: I bear witness that I heard this hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I bear witness that ‘Ali ibn     Abi Taalib fought them when I was with him. He ordered that that man be     sought, and he was found and brought; I looked at him and saw that he was     just as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     had described him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to     another report narrated by them (al-Bukhaari and Muslim):     “Among the progeny of this man will be     people who will recite the Qur’an, but it will not go any further than their     throats. They will pass through Islam as an arrow passes     through the prey. They will kill the people of Islam and     leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them, then I will     certainly kill them like ‘Aad (i.e., as ‘Aad were destroyed).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was     narrated that Naafi‘ ibn Maslamah al-Akhnasi said: Dhu’th-Thudayyah was a    man     from (the clan of) ‘Arnah from (the tribe of) Bajeelah. He was a very dark     black man who had a foul odour. He was well-known among the troops, and     before that he used to accompany us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bidaayah     wa’n-Nihaayah, 7/289&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Atheer     (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Dhu’th-Thudayyah – thudayyah     is the diminutive of thadiy (breast nipple) And may be taken as meaning a     piece of a breast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An-Nihaayah,     1/592&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim     (1066) narrated from ‘Ubaydah as-Salmaani, from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased     with him) that he mentioned the Khawaarij and said: and said: Among them is     a man with a defective arm, or a small arm. I would tell you what Allah     promised on the lips of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     to those who kill them. I said: Did you hear that from Muhammad (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah;     yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah; yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah.</p>\n<p>Muslim     (1066) and Abu Dawood (4768) narrated that Salamah ibn Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn     Wahb al-Juhani told me that he was&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was in     the army that was with ‘Ali and went out to fight the Khawaarij. ‘Ali said:     O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be     upon him) say: “There will appear some people among my ummah who will recite     the Qur’an and your recitation will not compare to theirs, and your prayer     will not compare to theirs, and your fasting will not compare to theirs.     They will recite the Qur’an and you will think that it is to their credit     but in fact it will count against them. Their prayer will not go any deeper     than their collar bones and they will pass out of Islam as an arrow passes     out of the prey. If the army that attacks them knew what has been decreed     for them on the lips of their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him), they would have relied on their deeds. The sign of that is that among     them there is a man who has an upper arm but no forearm, and on his upper     arm there is something like a nipple with white hairs on it. Would you go to     Mu’aawiyah and the people of Syria, and leave these people in charge of your     families and wealth in your absence?&nbsp; By Allah, I hope that they are the     same people, for they have shed blood unlawfully and attacked the people’s     cattle. March in the name of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Salamah ibn     Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn Wahb described to me the stops (made by the army)     until he said: then we crossed a bridge, and when we met (the Khawaarij),     who were being led that day by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Wahb al-Raasibi, he (‘Abd-Allah)     said to (his men): Throw your spears and draw your swords from their     sheaths, for I am afraid that they may urge you to negotiate as they did on     the day of Haroora’. So they threw their spears and unsheathed their swords,     and (the companions of ‘Ali) fought back with their spears, and they (the     Khawaarij) were killed and piled up one on top of another, but only two of     the people (i.e., the companions of ‘Ali) were killed that day. ‘Ali said:     Search among them for the one with the deformed hand. But they did not find     him. Then ‘Ali himself went to some people who had been killed and were     lying on top of one another. They took them out and found him among those     who were closest to the ground (at the bottom of the pile). He said takbeer     and said: Allah spoke the truth and His Messenger conveyed it. ‘Ubaydah al-Salmaani     stood up and said: O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, by Allah besides Whom there is no     other god, did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, by Allah besides Whom there is no     other god – until he asked him to swear three times and he did so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then Abu     Dawood narrated that Abu’l-Wadee’ said: It is as if I can see him, an     Abyssinian wearing a shirt, one of his hands like a woman’s nipple with     hairs on it like the hairs on the tail of a jerboa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Classed as     saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad (850)     narrated that Taariq ibn Ziyaad said: We went out with ‘Ali to fight the     Khawaarij, and he killed them then he said: Look, for the Prophet of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that there would emerge     people who would speak of the truth but it would not go past their throats;     they will pass out of the truth as the arrow passes out of the prey. The     sign is that one of them will be a black man with a deformed arm, with some     black hairs on his arm. If it is him, then you have killed the worst of     people, and if it is not him, then you have killed the best of people. And     we wept, then he said: Look. So we looked and we found the deformed man, and     we fell down in prostration and ‘Ali fell down in prostration with us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadeeth     has several isnaads; see al-Irwa’, 2/231&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz     (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was     narrated that Abu Maryam said: Indeed that deformed man was with us in the     mosque, and he was a poor man. I gave him a burnous of mine to wear and I     saw him attending meals with ‘Ali. He had on his arm something like the     breast of a woman, with a nipple on its end like the nipple of a breast,     with something on it like the whiskers of a cat. Both reports were narrated     by Abu Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At-Tabari     narrated it at length via Abu Maryam. In it, it says: Before that, ‘Ali used     to tell us that some people would appear and the sign would be a man with a     deformed arm. I heard that from him many times until I saw him – meaning the     deformed man – not wanting to eat with ‘Ali because he often heard that from     him. And in it, it says: Then he instructed his companions to look for the     deformed man, so they looked for him but they could not find him until a man     came and told him: We have found him beneath two slain men in a ditch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to     the report of Aflah: ‘Ali said: Which of you recognises this man? One of the     people said: We recognise him; this is Hurqoos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to     the report of ‘Aasim ibn Shamkh, Abu Sa‘eed said: Ten of the Companions of     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told me that ‘Ali     said: Look for the sign that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) spoke of, for I have never told lies and I will never     tell lies. He (that man) was brought, and ‘Ali praised and thanked Allah     when he recognised the sign. In the report of Abu Bakr, the freed slave of     the Ansaar, from ‘Ali, there were seven nipples around it. In that report it     states that the people were upset after the killing of the people of the     river, but ‘Ali said: I do not think but he was one of them. They found him     on the bank of the river, beneath the slain. ‘Ali said: Allah and His     Messenger spoke the truth. The people rejoiced when they saw his body, and     what they had been feeling disappeared.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote     from Fath al-Baari, 12/298&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more     information on the sect of the Khawaarij (Kharijites), please see the answer     to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/182237\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">182237</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah     knows best. </p>\n",
