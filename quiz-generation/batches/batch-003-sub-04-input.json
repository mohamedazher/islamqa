      "question": "<p>If a man is blessed with children and did not offer ‘aqeeqah for them until they were more than four years old, is it permissible for him to offer ‘aqeeqah for them after this age? If that is the case, then is it permissible for him to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah for them outside of the city where they were born? Because in the city where he lives there are no poor people who need meat, but there is a village far away from the place where they were born in which there are people who are deserving of charity. Is it permissible for the ‘aqeeqah to slaughtered there and the meat given in charity to those people? Or is it not stipulated that the meat of the ‘aqeeqah should be eaten by the poor?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with slaughtering the ‘aqeeqah on their behalf, even if they have passed the age of four years, although it would have been better to hasten to do it. But if it has been delayed, then there is nothing wrong with doing this; he may slaughter it whenever he can afford to do that.</p>\n<p>With regard to where the ‘aqeeqah is slaughtered, there is no specific place for that; rather it is permissible to slaughter it in the city where they were born, or elsewhere, because it is an act of worship for which no place is specified.</p>\n<p>With regard to eating the meat, the ‘aqeeqah comes under the same ruling as the udhiyah (sacrifice); it is mustahabb for the one who offers it to eat from it himself, to give some in charity, and to give some as gifts to his neighbours and friends.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (2/572)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

There is a hadith concerning that which is not sahih, hence the scholars regarded celebrating this day as an innovation (bid ‘ah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muhammad ‘Abd al-Salam al-Shuqayri said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Imam al-Fatni said in Tadhkirat al-Mawdu‘at: Among the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/10070\" target=\"_blank\">innovations</a> that have been introduced on “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/8907\" target=\"_blank\">Laylat an-Nisf</a> ”&nbsp; (mid-Sha‘ban) is al-Salat al-Alfiyyah, which is one hundred rak‘ahs in which Surat al-Ikhlas is recited ten times in each rak‘ah, offered in congregation; they pay more attention to this than to Jumu‘ah and ‘Eid prayers, although there is no report concerning it, except da‘if (weak) and mawdu‘ (fabricated) reports, and we should not be deceived by the fact that these reports were quoted by the authors of al-Qut and al-Ihya and others, nor should we be deceived by what was mentioned in Tafsir al-Tha‘labi, that it is Laylat al-Qadr.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-'Iraqi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The hadith about the prayer on Laylat al-Nisf (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/11722\" target=\"_blank\">mid-Sha‘ban</a> ) is false. Ibn al-Jawzi narrated it in al-Mawdu‘at (which is a compilation of fabricated hadiths):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter on the hadith, prayer and supplication on Laylat al-Nisf:</p>\n<p>The hadith, “When the night of ‘nisf Sha‘ban’ (mid-Sha‘ban) comes, spend the night in prayer and fast on that day” was narrated by Ibn Majah from ‘Ali. Muhashiyyah said: (It was also narrated) in al-Zawaid. Its isnad is da‘if (weak) because of the weakness of Ibn Abi Basrah, of whom Ahmad and Ibn Ma'in said: He fabricates hadith.”</p>\n<p>Praying six rak‘ahs on Laylat al-Nisf with the intention of warding off calamity, having a long life and being independent of people, and reciting Ya-Sin and offering du‘a in between that -- there is no doubt that this is something that has been introduced into the religion and is contrary to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The commentator on al-Ihya said: This prayer is well known in the books of later Sufi masters, but I have not seen any sahih report in the Sunnah to support it and the connected du‘a. Rather this is the action of some shaykhs. Our companions said: It is makruh to gather on any of the nights mentioned in the mosques or elsewhere. Al-Najm al-Ghayti said, describing spending the night of al-Nisf min Sh‘ban (mid-Sha‘ban) praying in congregation: That was denounced by most of the scholars of the Hijaz, including ‘Ata and Ibn Abi Mulaykah, the fuqaha of Madinah and the companions of Malik. They said: All of that is an innovation (bid‘ah) and there is no report to suggest that the Prophet spent that night in praying in congregation or that his Companions did that either. Al-Nawawi said: The prayers of Rajab and Sha‘ban are two reprehensible innovations.”(Al-Sunan wa’l-Mubtada‘at, p. 144)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Fatni (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after the comments quoted above:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The common folk are so infatuated with this prayer that they stored up a lot of fuel for it and many evils resulted from it, and many transgressions are committed which we do not need to describe. (It is so bad that) the close friends of Allah feared His punishment and fled into the wilderness. The first time this prayer occurred was in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) in 448 AH. Zayd ibn Aslam said: We never saw any of our shaykhs or fuqaha saying that Laylat al-Bara-ah (15 Sha‘ban) had any superiority over other nights. Ibn Dihyah said: The hadiths about the prayer on Laylat al-Bara-ah are fabricated and one has an interruption in the isnad. Anyone who acts upon a report which is known to be false is a servant of the Shaytan.” (Tadhkirat al-Mawdu‘at by al-Fatni, p. 45)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Mawdu‘at by Ibn al-Jawzi, 2/127; al-Manar al-Munif fil Sahih wa’l-Da‘if by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 98; al-Fawaid al-Majmu'ah by al-Shawkani, p. 51&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Shab_e_Barat_in_Islam\">Shab e Barat in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>Some people use the word al-Sha‘baniyyah to refer to the last days of <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/13726\" target=\"_blank\">Sha‘ban</a> , and say, “These are the days of bidding farewell to food,” and they take advantage of these days to eat a lot before Ramadan begins. Some scholars say that this idea was originally taken from the Christians, who used to do that as their fasting period (Lent) approached.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, there is no celebration in Sha‘ban and there is no special act of worship to be performed in the middle of it or during the last days of the month. Doing that is an innovation that has been introduced into the religion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Saying a du`a from the Quran when prostrating",
      "question": "<p>I am new to Islam and I have learned that it is not allowed to recite the quran while in prostration. But that is that best time to make du'a as one is nearest to his Creator. My question is what about the du'a's that we have that are from the Quraan. Are we allowed to make du'a with them in prostration? Or is that considered reciting?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade reciting Quran when bowing and prostrating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (479) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been forbidden to recite the Quran when bowing or prostrating. As for bowing, glorify your Lord therein, and as for prostrating, strive in du`a, for it is deserving of a response (from your Lord).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muslim (480) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade me to recite Quran when bowing and prostrating.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars are agreed that it is makrooh to recite Quran when bowing or prostrating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Majmoo’, 3/411; al-Mughni, 2/181&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wisdom behind that is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was said that the best pillar of prayer is standing and the best of dhikr is reciting Quran, so the best has been put with the best, and it is not allowed to put it with anything else, lest anyone think that it is equal to other kinds of dhikr. ‘Awn al-Ma’bood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was said that it is because the Quran is the noblest of speech, because it is the Word of Allah, and the position of bowing and prostration is one of humility and submission on the part of the worshipper, so it is more appropriate not to recite the Word of Allah in these two positions. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 5/338&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person recites a du`a that is mentioned in the Quran when prostrating, such as the words (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire” [al-Baqarah 2:201], there is nothing wrong with that, if the intention is to say du`a and not to recite Quran, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that which he intended.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1; Muslim, 1907.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Zarkashi said: It is makrooh when it is intended as recitation of Quran, but if it is intended as du`a and praise, then it is like someone who did Qunoot by reciting a verse. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Doing Qunoot by reciting a verse from the Quran is permissible and is not makrooh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 2/61&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 59)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person does Qunoot by reciting a verse which includes a du`a, then he has done Qunoot, but it is better to say the du`a as narrated in the Sunnah. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This applies if he intends to say du`a when he recites the verse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Ibn ‘Allaan, 2/308&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: We know that it is not permissible to recite Quran when prostrating, but there are some verses which include du`as, such as the words, “Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:8]. What is the ruling on saying such du`as that are mentioned in the Quran, when prostrating?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They replied: There is nothing wrong with that if it is done as a du`a and not as recitation of Quran.

      "title": "Why aren't travellers mentioned in the hadeeth, “Jumu’ah prayer is an obligatory duty for every Muslim except four”?",
      "question": "<p>In a hadeeth of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) it says: “Jumu’ah prayer is an obligatory duty for every Muslim except four.” Why is it that travellers not included among those for whom Jumu’ah prayer is waived in this hadeeth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      The hadeeth referred to in the question was narrated from       Taariq ibn Shihaab (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet       (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jumu’ah prayer is an       obligatory duty for every Muslim, to be offered in congregation, except       four: a slave who is owned, or woman, or a child, or one who is sick.”       Narrated by Abu Dawood (1067). Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’       (4/483): Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of the two       shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Ibn Rajab said in Fath al-Baari       (5/327): Its isnaad is saheeh. Ibn Katheer said in Irshaad al-Faqeeh       (1/190): Its isnaad is jayyid. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in      Saheeh al-Jaami’ (3111).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with     him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The     traveller is not obliged to pray Jumu’ah.” Al-Haafiz said in Buloogh al-Maraam:     Its isnaad is da’eef.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The exception of the traveller is also mentioned in a number     of hadeeths, including the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the     Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “There are     five for whom Jumu’ah is not obligatory: the woman, the traveller, the     slave, the child and the people of the wilderness.” It says in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id:     It was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat and its isnaad includes     Ibraaheem ibn Hammaad, who was classed as da’eef (weak) by al-Daaraqutni.     Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (He is) da’eef jiddan     (very weak).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is no secret that the shar’i rulings should be derived     from all of the hadeeths that were narrated concerning this specific     subject, and they should not be derived from only one hadeeth whilst     ignoring the rest of the hadeeths.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     mentioned a number, as we see in the hadeeth being asked about here, and     mentioning a number does not necessarily mean that it is limited to this     number. The aim may have been to make it easier to remember this hadeeth for     those who heard it. A similar example is the words of the Prophet (blessings     and peace of Allah be upon him): “There are seven whom Allah will shade with     His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His…” By compiling all     the hadeeths which speak of this great matter (“Allah will shade them with     His shade”) it becomes clear that there are more than 20 such categories,     not only seven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We can see from the hadeeths that Jumu’ah is not obligatory     for six people: children, as there is consensus that Jumu’ah is not     obligatory for them; slaves, as there is consensus on this matter except for     Dawood; women, and there is consensus that it is not obligatory for them;     sick people; travellers, who are not obliged to attend it; and the sixth     category, which is the people of the wilderness.

      "title": "Types of Speech to Refrain from",
      "question": "<p>I know there are certain types of speech which we must refrain from, like the speech the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stayed away from; please could you expound on that for me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslim has to control his tongue and not speak unless he says something good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or else keep silent …”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he wants to speak, then if what he wants to say is good and he is confident that he will be rewarded for it, whether it is obligatory or praiseworthy, then let him speak, but if it does not seem to him that it is good and he will be rewarded for it, then let him refrain from speaking, whether he thinks it is haram (impermissible) or makrooh (disliked) or permissible. Based on this, it is recommended to refrain from saying permissible words and we are enjoined to avoid this, lest it lead us into something that is haram or makrooh, which is what happens in many cases or in most cases. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).’ [50:18]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Imam al-Shafi’i understood the hadeeth (narration) to mean that if a person wants to say something, he should think about it: if it seems to him that it will not do any harm, then he should speak, but if he thinks that it will do some harm or he thinks that this is most likely, then he should refrain from speaking.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to control our tongues in more than one hadeeth, such as that narrated by al-Tirmidhi from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation?’ He said, ‘Control your tongue, keep to your house and weep over your sin.’” Classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Tirmidhi also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’adh (may Allah be pleased with him), after teaching him some of the laws of Islam, “Shall I not tell you what is the foundation of all that?” I [Mu’adh] said: “Of course, O Prophet of Allah.” He took hold of his tongue and said, “Control this.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, will we be held responsible for what we say with it?” He said, “May your mother be bereft of you, O Mu’adh! Will the people be thrown into Hell on their faces or on their noses for anything other than the harvest of their tongues?” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani.</p>\n<p>The hadeeth enjoins refraining from indulging in specific things, because this is something that is of no benefit to a person, and indeed it may cause him a great deal of harm in his spiritual and worldly affairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If my Companions are mentioned, then keep quiet; if the stars are mentioned, then keep quiet; and if the divine decree is mentioned, then keep quiet.” (Narrated by al-Tabarani and classed as saheeh / authentic).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadeeth indicates that it is not permissible for a person to speak badly of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that he should keep quiet about the disputes that occurred among them, because speaking badly of them or criticizing them implies that one is rejecting what Allah said about them in the Quran, where He praised them by saying (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhajiroon (emigrants) and the Ansar (helpers) and also those who followed them exactly (in faith). Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [9:100]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) good pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers).”</p>\n<p>[48:29]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is how Allah has described them in His Book, so no doubt they are of just character and are the best and greatest of mankind. So no one hates them but a hypocrite and no one loves them but a believer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“One of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah (followers of prophetic tradition) is that they think and say nothing to criticize the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as Allah has described them in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘And those who came after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.’</p>\n<p>[59:10]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And they obey the command of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ‘Do not curse my Companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to spend the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not reach the status of one of them, nor even come half way.’ (Agreed upon).” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 3/152.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Zar’ah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If you see a man criticizing any one of the sahabah (Companions), then know that he is a heretic, because the Quran is true, and the Messenger is true, and what he brought is true, and no one conveyed all of that to us but the sahabah. So whoever criticizes them means, in effect, to say that the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) are false, so it is more appropriate that he should be criticized and ruled to be a heretic who is misguided.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Sawa’iq al-Muhriqah ‘ala Ahl al-Rafd wa’l-Dalal wa’l-Zandaqah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the second part of the hadeeth, which enjoins refraining from speaking about the stars, what is referred to by that – and Allah knows best – is seeking guidance by the stars concerning matters that are unseen, as the people of the jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) used to do by means of astrology, such as using the movement of heavenly bodies to indicate when certain earthly events would occur, such as the blowing of the wind, rainfall, changes in prices, and other matters which they claimed to know from the movements of heavenly bodies. They used to say that whoever got married under a particular star, then such and such would happen to him, or whoever traveled under a particular star, such and such would happen to him, and whoever was born under a particular star would be lucky or unlucky, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(See Kitab al-Tawheed by al-Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan. See also Fatawa al-‘Aqeedah by al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, where he makes some very useful comments).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the third part of the hadeeth, which refers to refraining from speaking about the divine decree (al-qadar), Abu Ja’far al-Tahhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The divine decree is a secret known which Allah has hidden from His creation. No angel who is close to Him and no Prophet whom He sent knows that. Pursuing such matters only leads to failure and deprivation of the mercy of Allah, and it leads to injustice, so beware of looking into the matter, thinking about it and wondering about it. Allah has kept knowledge of His decree from His slaves, and has forbidden them to pursue the matter, as He says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.’</p>\n<p>[21:23]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So whoever questions what Allah does has rejected the ruling of the Book, and whoever rejects the ruling of the Book is a kafir (disbeliever).”&nbsp;Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhawiyyah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the Muslim has to submit to Allah in all His affairs, and know that whatever happens to him could never have missed him, and what misses him could never have happened to him. There is a lot that may be said on this topic. May Allah bless the man who believes in the will and decree of Allah without indulging in philosophical discussion about the matter.</p>\n",

Dealing with the credit is done on the basis of money, and the gold is no longer referred to at all when we are paying the debt. Is this transaction halaal or haraam?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible to sell gold for gold or silver, or whatever comes under the same category such as paper money, unless the exchange takes place on the spot.</p>\n<p>That is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1587) from ‘Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, … like for like, same for same, hand to hand. But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, as long as it is hand to hand.”</p>\n<p>Paper money comes under the same ruling as gold and silver.</p>\n<p>The Permanent Committee for Ifta’ was asked: If one man sells a piece of gold jewellery to another, but the purchaser does not have some or all of the price with him, or not after a few days or a month or two months, is this permissible or not?</p>\n<p>They replied: If the price for which he is buying the gold jewellery is to be paid in gold or silver or what comes under the same heading of paper money or cheques, that is not permissible; rather it is haraam, because of what it involves of riba an-nas’iah. But if he is purchasing it in return for other goods, such as fabric or food and the like, then the delay in payment is permissible.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"<em>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah</em> (13/466)\"</p>\n<p>The Committee was also asked:</p>\n<p>There is an agent who sells gold to all the shops on credit for a known price, whether that is for cash or on credit. We all buy from him on the basis that every week we will make a payment until it is all paid off, and that may take more than two months. Please note that the price of gold is not stable internationally.</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>Selling gold for silver or what takes its place of modern currencies is not permissible unless the exchange takes place on the spot. \"<em>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah</em> (13/471)\"</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to give gold to the purchaser and not receive the payment until after a while, because this is riba. \"<em>Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb</em>, by al-‘Uthaymeen..\"</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22869\" target=\"_blank\">22869</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I have a very important question to ask you and this will Insha'Allah benefit many other Muslims. A friend of mine was telling me that a wife cannot come in front of the husband's brother as he is not her Mahram. My question is this: I live with my parents and brother and sister. I and my brother pay the rent of the apartment.<br />\nInsha'Allah we are going to move to a rented house which will be bigger and the rent will be payed by me and my brother. I had thought of getting married because of the bigger house, but I don't know whether I could do this now unless I get my own separate house.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is no harm in you and your wife living in one house with the rest of the family members you mentioned. All that you have to be careful about is that your wife does not go out in front of your brother or be alone with him in the house, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade non-mahrams (unrelated men) to enter upon women. He said: \"Beware of entering upon women.\" One of the Sahaabah said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah, what about the brother-in-law?\" He said: \"The brother-in-law is death!\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330).</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"What is referred to in the hadeeth is all the husbands (male) relatives apart from his father and sons. People customarily take the matter of a man being alone with his brothers wife as being of little consequence; to indicate the seriousness of the matter, it was likened to death. Indeed, one should be more cautious about the brother-in-law than about a stranger. The phrase \"the brother-in-law is death\" may have a number of meanings:</p>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to disaster if a sin is committed, or may spell divorce for the woman if her husband cannot contain his jealousy;</li>\n<li>Or: Beware of being alone with a non-mahram woman fear this as you fear death.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>All this stems from Islams keenness to protect households, to avoid evil and to preserve marriages in the best possible way. You will find more details under question #<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/217\">217</a> .</p>\n<p>May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I am aware that using a visa card, etc. that carries abalance is considered riba, but does a card that you pay off each month without a balance and no interest charge still apply to this? is it still riba?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This question has been asked before, under No. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3402\">3402</a>, where it says: Credit cards are based on conditions of riba: if I delay repayment, they will impose a penalty on me, but in the place where I live in America, I cannot rent a car or a store or use many services without a credit card. If I do not use a credit card I will have a lot of problems and it will be unbearable for me. If I commit to paying it off by a certain time so that I will not pay any interest, is it permissible for me to use this card in the difficult circumstances in which I live? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He answered as follows: If it is certain that not using it is going to cause difficulty and the likelihood of you being late in paying it is remote, then I hope that there is nothing wrong with that. (Answered by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that two conditions are mentioned in the question: not using it should cause difficulty and he should have no other option but to use it; and the second condition is that he should be committed to paying it off without any delay.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>How correct is it for a sick person to visualize the one who put the eye on him as a result of Quran being recited over him, or the raaqi asking his qareen (jinn companion) to show the sick person who put the eye on him?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>For the sick person to visualize the one who put the eye on him as a result of Quran being recited over him, or the qaari’ (reciter) telling him to do so, is a devilish action and is not permitted, because it is seeking the help of the shayaateen (devils). The jinn is the one who makes him visualize the person who afflicted him with the evil eye, and this is haraam, because it is seeking the help of the shayaateen, and because it creates enmity among people and causes fear and terror to be spread among people. It comes under the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression”</p>\n<p>[al-Jinn 72:6]</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;[Translator’s note: Raaqi means one who does ruqyah i.e., reciting Quran and du’aa’s over the sick for the purpose of seeking healing]</p>\n",
