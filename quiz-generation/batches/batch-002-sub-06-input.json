      "title": "Is it permissible to refuse a suitor because he does not own an apartment?",
      "question": "<p>Is it permissible to refuse someone who comes to propose marriage because he does not own an apartment? Is it permissible to refuse to read al-Faatihah for the same reason, that he does not have an apartment? Please note that the girl agrees to this young man and his family are moderately well off. Is the girl’s speaking to the young man behind her family’s backs halaal or haram?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the one who is proposing marriage is acceptable in terms of religious commitment and good character, and he is able to provide accommodation, even if that will be after some time, then he should not be refused, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him, for if you do not do so, there will be tribulation and great mischief on earth.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1084) from Abu Hurayrah; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he is not able to provide accommodation, or he needs a lot of time until he can afford it, then there is nothing wrong with refusing him, because of the harm that will be caused to the girl by tying her to him and waiting a long time to get married. When Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan proposed to Faatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with them both), Mu’aawiyah was poor, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised her to refuse his offer, because he was poor and had no wealth. Narrated by Muslim (1480).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This suitor who is unable to afford the expenses of marriage is addressed by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty” [al-Noor 24:33] and&nbsp; by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5065)and Muslim (1400).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not prescribed to recite al-Faatihah at the time of engagement, because that is not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The mahr and accommodation are the rights of the wife, and she may be content with a little of that. Her guardian should help her to be chaste. If she accepts someone whose religious commitment and character are pleasing, and he has enough to provide accommodation and the mahr, then it is not permissible to prevent the girl from marrying. But if he does not have anything, then the guardian may refuse the proposal, because the girl’s agreement in this case is based on emotion and lack of experience, and perhaps she is deceived by the suitor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for a girl to form a relationship with a non-mahram man, whether he has proposed marriage to her or not, because of the bad consequences to which that may lead, as is obvious, especially if her family have refused his proposal; in that case there is no justifiable reason for him to speak to her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See also questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45668\">45668</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/36807\">36807</a> on the ruling on speaking and correspondence between a suitor and his fiancée.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.</p>\n",

      "title": "She is in a relationship with a Christian man and she wants him to become Muslim so she can marry him",
      "question": "<p>Do you have any way, how to make someone concious about religion.i have problems that i can't figure out my self.<br />\nI have woman to man relationship ( now almost take three years ), this friend of mine is a christiant,we are planning to get married but i want him to be a moslem .<br />\nPushing is not my intend,i want him to become a moslem sincerelly, i know hidayah is only from allah but we human must try the best...i'm not going to marry him if he is not a moslem...in the same time i want him to be my husband ...help me</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There are many ways of creating interest in Islam, such as reading the seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or reading about the miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or about his prevailing victories and the defeat of his enemies. One may also look at the beauties of Islam, or explain that the sharee’ah of Islam includes everything that is good, and that sharee’ah does not enjoin anything except that which is in accordance with reason and common sense, and it does not forbid anything without explaining what is wrong with it and putting people off it. For this reason people, Arabs and others, entered Islam voluntarily, without being forced. We advise this woman to put an end to her relationship with this Christian man which has lasted for so long and he is still persisting in his kufr. If he chooses Islam of his own free will, then he must be tested after that to be certain that he is sincere. He must also be told that if he goes back to Christianity after becoming Muslim, he is to be killed. (Because the punishment for apostasy in Islam is death. Whoever recognizes the true religion and enters it then leaves it, does not deserve to live. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.” This is what is to be applied if he is living in a country which is ruled by sharee’ah. The point is that this person should be informed of the seriousness of the matter. And Allaah is the source of strength.)&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on mixed da‘wah groups",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on mixed da‘wah groups on Facebook and WhatsApp? If they are not permissible, then is the ruling different if the women merely follow the group without participating in it?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Islamic teachings aim to close the door to evil and temptation in order to protect people’s religious commitment and piety, and to keep their hearts free of the traces of desires and sin.</p>\n<p>Direct conversations and correspondence between specific men and women on the Internet – whether by speaking or writing – are among the doors that lead to temptation and evil, because of what results from these conversations of getting carried away in talking, which usually leads to admiration and infatuation.</p>\n<p>How often have such conversations brought about evil and calamity for those who participate in them, until they ended up falling in love and becoming infatuated, and – in some cases – has led to what is even worse than that, for the Shaytaan makes each party imagine about the other things that lead to infatuation which brings about negative consequences in both worldly and spiritual terms.</p>\n<p>Islamic teachings close the doors that lead to temptation. Islam forbids women to speak softly, and it forbids a man to shake hands with a non-mahram woman or look at her, or to be alone with her. Islam explains that these matters are among the causes that lead to temptation. This is something that is proven by experience and well-known.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Dhamm al-Hawa (p. 582):</p>\n<p>Among the reprehensible carelessness that leads to the most serious trouble for individuals is speaking to non-mahram women and being alone with them. That was customary among some of the Arab tribes, who thought that that was not shameful, and they were confident that they would refrain from zina, so they were content to look at and speak to [those women]. But these things had an impact on the heart and soul without them realizing, until that led them to trouble and doom. This careless attitude caused many problems for “Majnoon Layla” [a figure in ancient Arabic literature who went mad because of his unrequited love for a woman called Layla] and others like him, and led them to insanity and doom.</p>\n<p>They erred on two counts:</p>\n<p>1. They went against Islamic teachings which forbade looking at non-mahram women and being alone with them.</p>\n<p>2. They exposed themselves to that to which they were naturally inclined, then they suffered in their attempts to restrain themselves, because human nature will usually have its way; so if a person’s natural inclination is strong and he cannot resist it, he will end up falling into sin. But if he resists his natural inclination, then that will lead to his ruin, like preventing a thirsty person from drinking water. End quote.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/277583\">277583</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/34841\">34841</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that a woman should keep away from chat rooms and other groups on social media and apps, and she should avoid wasting her time and protect her dignity.</p>\n<p>But if there is some benefit to be gained from a study group or a da‘wah group, and she thinks that there is something in it from what she may benefit, then there is nothing wrong with her taking part in these beneficial study groups or da‘wah groups, whilst ensuring that she adheres strictly to proper etiquette and remains completely serious, and shuts the door to any kind of temptation for herself or others. She should pay attention to the following things:</p>\n<p>1. She should not post anything that may provoke desire in these groups; rather she should only post that which is useful and beneficial.</p>\n<p>2. Comments should only be as much as is needed or is beneficial, and participants should avoid making any comment that could provoke desire or attract the attention of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p>3. The women’s participation should only be as much as is needed. So she should post her question or topic, then leave and not comment except when absolutely necessary, because the basic principle is that she should refrain from speaking to men or mixing with them.</p>\n<p>4. There should be nothing in her words that could provoke desire, such as joking or speaking softly, or laughing (such as writing “hahahaha”), or using smiling emojis, because that may lead to coveting on the part of one in whose heart is disease, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women. If you fear Allah , then do not be soft in speech [to men], lest he in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with appropriate speech”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:32].</p>\n<p>5. She should avoid giving out her email address, or corresponding privately with any man, even if that is for the purpose of seeking help, because of what such correspondence usually leads to of infatuation and temptation.</p>\n<p>6. If a woman joins the group in order to follow only, in order to benefit without participating or commenting, there is nothing wrong with that, and it is safer for her.</p>\n<p>7. Over and above all of that, each individual is responsible for his own self. So each person should check his own self and his actions, and he should check his heart and be aware of what influences him. If he notices any trace of temptation, evil or corruption, he should hasten to leave and close the door to corruption, for there is nothing of greater worth than being safe.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82196\">82196</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) shortened prayers during all his journeys, and it is not proven that he offered the prayers in full whilst travelling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21498\" target=\"_blank\">praying in congregation is obligatory for the traveller</a> just as it is obligatory for the non-traveller, and he should not forsake the congregation in order to shorten his prayer, rather he should pray with the congregation, and if the Imam offers the prayer in full, then he should offer the prayer in full behind him.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Joining_prayers_when_travelling\"><strong>Joining prayers when travelling</strong></span></h3>\n<p>With regard to the traveller <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/49885\" target=\"_blank\">joining two prayers</a> , this is permissible, but it is better not to join them unless there is some difficulty in offering each prayer at its own time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, the ruling on shortening and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/153665\" target=\"_blank\">joining prayers</a> for the traveller is not one and the same. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/60358\" target=\"_blank\">Shortening the prayers</a> is a confirmed Sunnah for all travellers, whereas <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/153665\" target=\"_blank\">joining the prayers</a> is permissible but is not Sunnah, but it may be Sunnah and recommended if there is some difficulty involved in not doing it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the Sunnah, this is indicated by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) shortened his prayers on all his journeys, which indicates that the Sunnah for the traveller is to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/84\" target=\"_blank\">shorten his prayers</a> . As for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/153665\" target=\"_blank\">joining prayers</a> , it is proven that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined prayers when travelling, and it is also proven that he did not join prayers, which indicates that joining prayers is not a recommended Sunnah for all travellers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, the traveller does not have the choice between shortening or not shortening his prayers; rather it is confirmed that he should shorten his prayers, unless he is praying behind an Imam who is offering the prayer in full, in which case he should offer the prayer in full behind him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for joining prayers, the traveller has the choice: he may join them or not join them, or he may join them sometimes and not at other times.

      "question": "<p>There is some pus that comes out of my penis from time to time, because of a bladder infection. Does this invalidate the fast, prayer and wudoo’?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>With regard to the fast, that does not invalidate it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to purification and prayer:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This pus that comes out of the urethra is najis (impure). If it comes out occasionally, but usually it does not come out, then it is obligatory to purify oneself of it every time it comes out, and to wash off whatever of it has gotten onto the body or clothes. It invalidates wudoo, and if comes out during the prayer, it renders it invalid. So in that case he should stop praying, go and purify himself and do wudoo’,&nbsp; and start the prayer all over again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if it comes out all the time, then it comes under the same ruling as urinary incontinence. In this case, he should clean himself (instinja’), purify anything it got onto, wrap something over it so that it will not get onto his garment and the impurity will not spread further, then he should do wudoo’ at the time of each prayer, and it will not matter if it comes out after that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who had a constant discharge of pus from his penis: is his prayer valid when this is coming out?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to give up praying; rather he should pray according to what he is able to do. If the impurity does not stop long enough for him to do wudoo’ and pray, then he should pray according to his situation, after doing wudoo’, even if the impurity comes out whilst he is praying. But he should put something over it so as to prevent the impurity spreading further.

      "question": "<p>I am from Riyadh, and my mother and father were staying with me for a two-month visit in Riyadh, and we intended to do Hajj this year. We went to Makkah on the first day of Dhu’l-Qa‘dah to do ‘umrah, and we are going to stay in Makkah until Hajj, in sha Allah. We entered ihram for ‘umrah from the miqaat of as-Sayl, and I asked them not to say that it was ‘umrah as part of Hajj tamattu‘, because I cannot afford to pay the price for the hadiy (sacrificial animal), and we are going to do Hajj ifraad. Now they are in Makkah. What is the solution? Can they enter ihram for Hajj ifraad from Makkah on the day of at-Tarwiyah (the eighth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah), or do they have to complete it as Hajj tamattu‘? Or do they have to offer a hadiy?

But if you go back to your city, then come back from your city and enter ihram for Hajj on its own, then you are not doing tamattu‘, so you do not have to offer a hadiy.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa al-‘Uthaymeen (24/191)</p>\n<p>He also said:</p>\n<p>So long as you came from your country, intending to do Hajj, and you entered ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, then you are doing tamattu‘ regardless of whether or not you intended to do tamattu‘, because what you have done is tamattu‘.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa al-‘Uthaymeen.</p>\n<p>He (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>I came in Ramadan to perform ‘umrah and I intended to remain there until Hajj. On the fourth day of Shawwaal I did ‘umrah on behalf of my deceased sister. Please note that I was not aware that the one who does ‘umrah during the months of Hajj is regarded as doing tamattu‘. Do I have to offer a hadiy now, because I am doing tamattu‘?</p>\n<p>The shaykh replied: The one who does tamattu‘ is the one who enters ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, after the month of Shawwaal begins, with the intention of doing Hajj in the same year, then he does Hajj. The one who is doing tamattu‘ must offer whatever hadiy he can afford, such as a sheep, a goat or a lamb that is older than six months and is free of any defects that would prevent it from being acceptable as a sacrifice. If you are not able to do that, then you must fast for three days during Hajj and seven days after you return home, making a total of ten. The three days during hajj begin from the time the pilgrim enters ihram for ‘umrah. In other words, for example, a person may do tamattu‘ now, when he has no money. In this case we say: Fast from now; fast three days during Hajj and seven days when he goes back to his family and his journey is over. And if he says: I cannot fast on consecutive days, we say: Let him fast for one day and not fast for one or two days. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “then a fast of three days during hajj” [al-Baqarah 2:196]; He did not stipulate that they be consecutive. If Allah had wanted us to fast these days consecutively, He would have stated that. And if a person says: I cannot fast, because I have diabetes and I need water, and I cannot fast for three days or even for one day, then in that case he does not have to do anything, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity” [al-Baqarah 2:286].</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa al-‘Uthaymeen (22/42).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen also said:</p>\n<p>Should he say, “Labbayk ‘umaratan mutamatti‘an biha ila al-hajj [Here I am for ‘umrah, joining it to Hajj (tamattu‘)]”?</p>\n<p>The answer is: No, there is no need for him to say this, because simply intending to do Hajj in the same year is in effect tamattu‘. Tamattu‘ means entering ihram for ‘umrah during the months of Hajj, and finishing it [and exiting ihram], then entering ihram [again] for Hajj in the same year. There is no need to say “joining it to Hajj”. Rather the pilgrim should simply say “Labbayka ‘umratan [Here I am for ‘umrah], and if he has the intention of doing Hajj, this is tamattu‘.</p>\n<p>End quote from Jalasaat al-Hajj.</p>\n",
