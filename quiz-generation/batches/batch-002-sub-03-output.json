      "question_text": "What is the ruling on joining a company that sells gold through pyramid marketing where you buy gold for $800 and recruit six buyers to earn continuous profits?",
      "correct_answer": "It is forbidden because it involves gambling, consuming people's wealth unlawfully, and violates the requirement that gold and currency must be exchanged hand-to-hand in the same sitting",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "It is forbidden only if the gold is not delivered within three business days of the contract",
        "It is forbidden only because the company offers payment by installments, but would be permissible if paid upfront in one payment",
        "It is forbidden only during the sacred months when commercial transactions involving precious metals are restricted"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Gold for gold, silver for silver...hand to hand. If any of these types are different, then sell however you like, so long as it is hand to hand' (narrated by Muslim). This company violates this requirement by delaying delivery of gold after the contract, involves pyramid marketing which is gambling, and some offer installment payments which is also forbidden for gold transactions."

      "question_text": "What is the ruling on hunting birds during the sacred months or inside the boundary of the sanctuary (al-haram)?",
      "correct_answer": "Hunting birds during the sacred months is permissible, but hunting any game inside the sanctuary boundary is forbidden because the Prophet said 'Its game is not to be disturbed'",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "Hunting birds is forbidden during the sacred months but permissible inside the sanctuary if you are not in a state of ihram",
        "Hunting birds is permissible during the sacred months only if you recite specific supplications before hunting",
        "Hunting birds is forbidden during the sacred months but becomes permissible after the first ten days of each sacred month have passed"
      ],
      "explanation": "According to Majmoo' Fataawa Ibn 'Uthaymeen (22/230-231), what is forbidden during the sacred months is only fighting, and many scholars say this prohibition has been abrogated. However, inside the sanctuary boundary, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prohibited disturbing game when he conquered Makkah, and Allah says in al-Maa'idah 5:95-96 that hunting land game is forbidden while in ihram or within the sanctuary."

      "question_text": "Can a Muslim live a 100% perfect Muslim life without ever committing any sins while interacting with society?",
      "correct_answer": "No, the Muslim is not infallible and every son of Adam inevitably commits sin, but the best are those who continually repent and keep their duty to Allah as much as they can",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "Yes, but only if they isolate themselves completely from society and live in seclusion to avoid all temptations",
        "Yes, if they follow a specific scholarly school (madhhab) strictly and perform extra voluntary prayers daily",
        "No, unless they have reached the spiritual rank of the awliya (saints) through decades of worship and asceticism"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a hadith that every son of Adam inevitably commits sin and the best of those who sin are those who continually repent. Allah says in al-Taghaabun 64:16: 'So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.' A Muslim's religious commitment is not affected by some sins committed without meaning to, and when one slips or stumbles, they must hasten to repent sincerely."

      "question_text": "A legally blind person uses a guide dog for mobility and wants to attend the mosque. What should they do with the guide dog?",
      "correct_answer": "Leave the dog at a distance from the mosque entrance and enter for worship without the dog, as keeping the dog is excused due to urgent need for mobility",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "Bring the dog inside the mosque but keep it on a short leash in the back row during prayer",
        "Only attend the mosque during times when few people are present so the dog causes minimal disturbance",
        "Arrange for someone to hold the dog inside the mosque's courtyard while attending the prayer inside"
      ],
      "explanation": "While keeping a dog without due need is censured in Islamic shari'ah due to its filth and uncleanness, keeping a dog for an urgent need like blindness is a valid excuse. However, there is no requirement to enter the mosque with the dog. The person should leave the dog at a distance from the entrance and enter for worship, attending religious gatherings, or learning. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him for them Heaven' (Sahih al-Bukhari #5653)."

      "question_text": "An imam delivers a Jumu'ah khutbah that, along with the prayer, takes only ten minutes total. What is the assessment of this practice?",
      "correct_answer": "This imam does not have deep understanding of Islam because understanding means keeping the khutbah short and making the prayer long, not effectively destroying both",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "This is the ideal practice because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said the shortest khutbah is the most beloved to Allah",
        "This is acceptable during summer months when the heat is intense, but should be extended during cooler seasons",
        "This is permissible as long as the imam recites at least one complete surah during the khutbah portion"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'A man's lengthening his prayer and shortening his khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion)' (narrated by Muslim 869). Shaykh Sa'ood al-Shuraym noted that reciting al-Jumu'ah and al-Munaafiqoon at moderate speed in Fajr prayer takes 10-15 minutes alone. A khutbah and prayer together in ten minutes means clear undermining of both matters. While keeping the khutbah short is Sunnah, it should not be taken to such extremes that its benefit is erased altogether, and the khutbah should be moderate as narrated by Jaabir ibn Samurah (Muslim 1433)."

      "question_text": "According to the hadith, why will women form the majority of the people in Hell?",
      "correct_answer": "Because they are ungrateful to their husbands and ungrateful for good treatment, such that if you are kind to one of them for a lifetime then she sees one undesirable thing, she will say 'I have never had anything good from you'",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "Because women are required to wear hijab but many fail to do so properly during their lifetime",
        "Because women typically live longer than men and therefore have more years during which they might commit sins",
        "Because women are prohibited from leading congregational prayers and this restriction makes worship more difficult for them"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this clearly when asked. He said women are ungrateful to their companions (husbands) and ungrateful for good treatment. As narrated by Al-Bukhari (1052) from Abdullah ibn Abbas, the Prophet said: 'If you are kind to one of them for a lifetime then she sees one (undesirable) thing in you, she will say, I have never had anything good from you.' He also mentioned they curse frequently and are ungrateful to their husbands (narrated by Al-Bukhari 304). The advice for Muslim women is to strive to adhere to obligatory duties, especially prayer, and keep away from forbidden things, especially shirk."

      "question_text": "The government allocates only certain mosques for i'tikaaf and prevents people from observing i'tikaaf in other mosques. What is the ruling on this restriction?",
      "correct_answer": "Whoever wants to observe i'tikaaf in any mosque has the right to do so, and preventing them without valid reason may include them under the verse about those who forbid Allah's Name in His mosques",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "This restriction is permissible as long as at least one mosque in each city district is allocated for i'tikaaf",
        "This restriction is recommended to prevent overcrowding and ensure proper supervision of those observing i'tikaaf",
        "This restriction is obligatory during Ramadan but can be relaxed during other months of the year"
      ],
      "explanation": "Mosques were built for Allah's worship including prayer, reading Quran, remembering Allah, and i'tikaaf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Rather they [mosques] are for the remembrance of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and prayer, and reading Quran' (narrated by Muslim 285). Every Muslim has the right to enter mosques and worship Allah there in the prescribed fashion. The one who prevents them may be included in the verse: 'And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allah's Name be glorified and mentioned much in Allah's mosques' (al-Baqarah 2:114). However, prohibiting i'tikaaf may be acceptable if the mosque is small and does not have enough room for worshippers, as i'tikaaf would bother them and cause overcrowding."

      "question_text": "If someone does a good deed with an intention other than to please Allah (such as showing off), then sincerely repents, what happens to the reward for that deed?",
      "correct_answer": "The reward that was lost because of the bad intention will be restored after sincere repentance, just as the kaafir who did righteous deeds then became Muslim is rewarded for his previous virtues",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "The reward is permanently lost and the person must repeat the same good deed with correct intention to earn new reward",
        "The reward is reduced by half as a consequence of the initial improper intention, even after repentance",
        "The reward is only restored if the person publicly announces their repentance to those who witnessed the original deed"
      ],
      "explanation": "As narrated in al-Bukhari (1436) and Muslim (123), Hakeem ibn Hizaam asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about things he did as worship during Jaahiliyyah, and the Prophet said: 'You have become Muslim with all your previous virtues.' Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali commented: 'If a person did a righteous deed, then he did a bad deed which cancelled it out, then he repented, then the reward that was lost because of his bad deed will be restored to him' (Fath al-Baari 1/146). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah explained that the one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin, and if the sin is erased then the punishment and consequences are erased, including the negation of good deeds."

      "question_text": "A Muslim woman praying at home wants to know: what is the latest she can delay 'Isha' prayer without sinning?",
      "correct_answer": "She must pray 'Isha' before midnight, which is calculated as halfway between sunset and dawn, not half an hour before the Fajr adhan",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "She can pray 'Isha' until the time when dawn begins to break in the sky, as long as she finishes before the Fajr adhan is called",
        "She can delay 'Isha' until one hour before the Fajr adhan in cases of necessity such as household duties or childcare",
        "She must pray 'Isha' within the first third of the night unless she has a valid excuse such as illness or menstruation"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'The time for 'Isha' is until midnight' (narrated by Muslim 217). To calculate midnight, determine the time from sunset until dawn, and halfway between the two is the end of 'Isha' time. For example, if the sun sets at 5:00 PM and Fajr adhan is at 5:00 AM, then midnight is 11:00 PM. It is not permissible to delay prayers beyond their due time, as Allah says: 'Verily, As-Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours' (al-Nisa' 4:103). However, it is better to hasten to perform prayers when their time begins, as the Prophet said prayer offered on time is the most beloved deed to Allah (al-Bukhari 496)."

      "question_text": "Is a person counted as committing sin openly if they commit a sin in front of their own children inside their house?",
      "correct_answer": "This is worse than committing sin openly because in addition to committing sin openly, it is giving the children a bad upbringing",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "No, it is not counted as committing sin openly as long as it occurs inside the privacy of one's own home",
        "It is counted as committing sin openly only if the children are older than the age of discernment (approximately seven years old)",
        "It is counted as committing sin openly only if the children are likely to imitate the specific sin being committed"
      ],
      "explanation": "Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-'Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked this question and answered: 'I seek refuge with Allah! This is worse than committing sin openly, because in addition to committing sin openly, it is giving a bad upbringing.' He explained that if someone were to sin in their own room alone, it would not be counted as committing sin openly, but doing it in front of children means both bad upbringing and committing sin openly. He gave the example that smokers must not smoke in front of their children, because by doing so they are teaching them to smoke."
