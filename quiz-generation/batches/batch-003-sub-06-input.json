      "title": "Is Learning Fiqh of Financial Transactions Essential?",
      "question": "<p>Is learning the fiqh of buying and selling and financial transactions obligatory (fard ‘ayn – an individual obligation) for everyone who engages in buying and selling, such as a pharmacist and representatives of pharmaceutical companies?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the Muslim understands that the purpose and aim of his being created in this world is to adhere to the laws of Allah, and to worship Allah by doing so, then he will also understand that it is essential for him to learn the rulings of Allah’s laws and learn what his duties are. That is because what is needed in order to do what is obligatory is also obligatory. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20092\" target=\"_blank\">Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim</a> .” (Narrated by Ibn Majah (224) and classed as hasan because of its many isnads and corroborating reports by al-Mazzi, al-Zarkashi, al-Suyuti, al-Sakhaawi, al-Dhahabi, al-Manawi, and al-Zarqani. It is also in Sahih Ibn Majah by al-Albani.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars have stated that the meaning of this hadith is sahih.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“But its meaning is sahih in their opinion, even though they differed somewhat concerning it.\" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm&nbsp; 1/53)</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said something similar in al-Mathurat (p. 287), as did Ibn al-Qayyim in Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah (1/480).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“The scholars are unanimously agreed that acquiring some types of knowledge is an individual obligation, which each person must learn for himself, and acquiring other types of knowledge is a communal obligation – if some people acquire it then the obligation of others is waived.\" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi&nbsp; 1/56)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have described the knowledge which must be learned on an individual basis, and they have spoken of the amount of knowledge which each Muslim must acquire. They said that this includes learning the rulings on selling for those who engage in trade, so that they will not do anything haram or fall into riba (usury) without realizing. There are reports from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) which support that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “No one should sell in our marketplace except those who have knowledge of Islam.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 487, who said: it is hasan gharib. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever engages in trade before learning will fall into riba, then fall into riba.” (Mughni al-Muhtaj 2/22)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What all people must learn is that which they cannot afford to be ignorant of such as bearing witness verbally and believing in the heart that Allah is One and has no partner or associate, and that His names and attributes are eternal; He has no beginning and no end, and He has risen over the Throne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, and that all people will be resurrected after death to be rewarded or punished for their deeds, and that the Quran is the Word of Allah, and that what is in it is true. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should affirm that the five daily prayers are obligatory, and he must know what is essential for the performance of the prayer, such as purification and other rulings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He should affirm that fasting Ramadan is obligatory, and he must know what invalidates the fast and what is essential for the completion of the fast.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he has enough wealth and is physically able to perform Hajj, he must know what zakah is due on, and when it becomes due, and on how much it is due. He must perform Hajj once in his life if he has the means.</p>\n<p>And there are things that he must know in general and he has no excuse for not knowing: such as the fact that zina and riba are forbidden, as are alcohol, pork, eating dead meat and all impure things, embezzling, bearing false witness, consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, all kinds of wrongdoing and oppression, marrying one’s mother or sister or any of those who are mentioned with them, and killing a believer unlawfully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And he must know all other things that are mentioned in the Book and that the ummah is agreed upon.\" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm&nbsp; 1/57)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (30/293):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Ibn ‘Abidin said, quoting from al-‘Allami:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is obligatory for every accountable person, male or female , after learning about religion and guidance, to learn about wudu, ghusl, prayer, fasting, zakah for those who have the nisab (minimum threshold of wealth) and Hajj for those for whom it is obligatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Merchants must also learn the rulings on trade, so that they can avoid doubtful and makruh things in their <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/193073\" target=\"_blank\">transactions</a> ; the same applies to those who follow professions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everyone who works with something must learn the rulings concerning it so that he can avoid what is haram.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said: \"As for selling, marriage and the like – which are not obligatory per se – it is haram to engage in them until one has learned their conditions.”</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If a Muslim is a merchant and riba is widespread in the land, he must learn about the prohibition on riba. This is knowledge which is an individual obligation, i.e., knowledge of how to do what is required.\" (Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din&nbsp; 1/33)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq said to Ibn al-Mubarak:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What can the believer do with knowledge except seeking it? What is he obliged to learn?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: “He cannot afford to do anything without knowledge, and he cannot avoid asking.” (Narrated by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm (1/56)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Every person in his daily life is bound to face new issues with regard to his worship and dealings with others. So he must ask about everything, whatever new issues he encounters, and he must hasten to find out about what he expects to face before he faces it.” (Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din, 1/34)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advice to those who work in trade and buying and selling is to read some of the books that have been written about the fiqh of transactions, such as al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan, and Ma la Yas’u al-Tajir Jahlulu by Prof. ‘Abd-Allah al-Muslim and Salah al-Sawi.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more, please see this category: <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/146/\" target=\"_blank\">Business and Financial Transactions</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "She married him without a guardian (wali) and now she wants to leave him, but he does not want that",
      "question": "<p>My question is that, my friend did nikkah with her boyfriend for many years ago. just some friends knew about that nikkah. there parents were not invovled. Then they broke up and the boy refused to give her tallaaq/divorse. He got married and have kids now. She wants to get married but can not do that because of that nikkah. She has asked the boy many times but he has been refusing many years now, so what should she do? There is no Qazi here at our place know can declear her KHULLAH/tallaq.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What appears to be the case from your question is that the     one you are asking about got married without the permission or knowledge of     her guardian. If that is the case, then the more correct scholarly view is     that the marriage is not valid, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission     of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her     marriage is invalid.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi     (1102). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no.     2709&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of the imams are of the view that a marriage done     without a guardian is valid, and they classed as da‘eef (weak) the hadeeth     which stipulates that there should be a guardian in order for the marriage     to be valid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This has been discussed in the answer to questions no.    <a href=\"/ar/answers/\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">126430</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/7989\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">7989</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the partners are separated in a marriage concerning the     validity of which the scholars differed, it has to be done through talaaq     (divorce).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the marriage concerning which there is a     difference of scholarly opinion, one of two scenarios apply:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1.The married person thinks that     it is valid. If he thinks that it is valid, then the talaaq counts as such,     and there is no confusion concerning that. For example: a man got married to     a woman who breastfed from his mother three times, and he thinks that the     breastfeeding that makes a person a mahram is five feedings. So the marriage     is valid in his opinion. In this case talaaq undoubtedly counts as such.</p>\n<p>    Similarly, if he married a woman without witnesses, and he     thinks that witnessing in marriage is not a condition of it being valid. In     this case talaaq counts as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2.The married person does not     think that the marriage is valid. In this case the scholars differed as to     whether talaaq counts as such. Some of them said that talaaq does count as     such in this case, and some of them said that it does not. Those who said     that it does not count as such said that it is because talaaq is connected     to the marriage contract. He does not think that the marriage is valid, so     he cannot issue a talaaq. This reasoning is good and there is nothing wrong     with it.</p>\n<p>    Those who say that it does not count as such say that is     because, even though he does not think the marriage is valid, others may     think that it is valid. So if he leaves her without talaaq, then a man comes     to her who thinks that the marriage was valid, he can never marry her. So     talaaq is valid with regard to a marriage concerning the validity of which     there is a difference of opinion, even if the one who issues the talaaq does     not think this is valid, because if he does not divorce her by talaaq, this     will leave this woman in limbo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If someone were to say: Why does the talaaq count as such     when he does not think that the marriage is valid and talaaq is connected to     it? We say: That is so that he will not prevent her from marrying someone     else, because someone who thinks that that marriage was valid may want to     marry her, and if this husband does not divorce her by talaaq, the other man     will never be able to marry her, because he thinks that she is still married     to him. Hence the author said: “Talaaq counts as such in the marriage     concerning the validity of which there is a difference of opinion.” And it     says in al-Rawd: “even if the one who is issuing the talaaq does not     think that.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Sharh al-Mumti‘ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,     13/25&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information please see the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/ar/answers/\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">116575</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if they did the marriage contract in the     manner mentioned in the question and they think that it was a valid     marriage, then it is essential to divorce by talaaq, so that their     separation will be confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the husband refuses to divorce his wife by talaaq or to     accept her khula‘, and she will be harmed by staying with him, then in this     case she should refer the matter to the Muslim qaadi (judge) so that he can     issue a divorce (talaaq) from him. If she is in a non-Muslim country, then     she should refer the matter to the people of knowledge in the Islamic     centres, because they take the place of the Muslim qaadi, and if they rule     that she is divorced by talaaq, then it counts as such.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>If these insects are harmful, they may be killed with insecticides, but not with fire. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are five pests that may be killed whether one is in Ihram or not: rats, scorpions, crows, kites [a hawk-like bird], and mad dogs.” (Reported by Muslim, 2071) Another report adds a sixth, snakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that they are harmful pests, and that they are unlike other animals which do not do harm, and so he told us to kill them whether we are in Ihram or not.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If other creatures, such as ants or cockroaches or dung-beetles, cause harm, they may also be killed with insecticides, but not with fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please refer to the following answers: <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/105190\" target=\"_blank\">105190</a> , <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/2896\" target=\"_blank\">2896</a> , and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/289055\" target=\"_blank\">289055</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Some people claimed to have sighted the new moon of Ramadan, whilst astronomers and those who follow calculations claim that it is not possible to have sighted it on that night. There is no confusion in my mind because of this, as calculations may be wrong. But what does confuse me is that the astronomers and those who deal with calculations claim that they tried to sight the moon that night with the telescopes and other equipment that they have but they did not see it. How can it be seen with the naked eye and not with modern equipment? If it were the other way around, and they saw it with their equipment but it was not seen with the naked eye, there would be some justification for the difference of opinion as to whether we should fast or not, and whether the people should break the fast or not. But the problem is: How can they see it with the naked eye and it is not seen with their equipment? In fact I would like you to explain clearly so as to dispel my anxiety and confusion, because I do not think I am alone in this matter.</p>\n",

This is what is indicated by the authentic Sunnah, and the scholars unanimously agreed on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (1909) and Muslim (1081) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/68828\" target=\"_blank\">the new moon</a> ) and break the fast when you see it, and if it is cloudy then reckon the month as thirty.” &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Do_astronomical_calculations_count_in_determining_the_beginning_and_end_of_Hijri_months\">Do astronomical calculations count in determining the beginning and end of Hijri months?</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/106489\" target=\"_blank\">Astronomical calculations do not count</a> . The basic principle with regard to sighting is that it should be done with the naked eye, but if the crescent moon is sighted with <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1226\" target=\"_blank\">modern equipment</a> , then this sighting may be acted upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to how the new moon is sighted with the naked eye <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/1245\" target=\"_blank\">when it is not seen with telescopes</a> and equipment, this may be due to differences in the place and time of sighting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, the ruling depends on the sighting of the new moon.

Some astronomers went to him and met with him in the region of Hawtah Sadir. He told me that they estimated that the moon would appear on that night in a certain place according to the calculations they did on their computers, but he told them that it would not appear from the place that they said, because he had seen it before them the night before, and he knew the stations of the moon and from where it would rise every night. Then when the moon appeared, it rose from the place he mentioned and not the place they mentioned. However, he pardons them because&nbsp; their conclusion was not based on direct moon sighting; rather it was based on calculations with the computers they had.” (From an interview with him in Ar-Riyadh newspaper)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more details, please see this category: <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/109/\" target=\"_blank\">Seeing the New Moon</a>.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "al-Namrood and the people of the ditch",
      "question": "<p>In which book of Hadees is the Explanation of Namrood's infanticide during the days of Hazarat Abrahim ?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Al-Namrood was the king of Babylon, and he     was a kaafir king. There happened between him and Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) that which Allaah describes in the verse (interpretation of the     meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Have you not looked at him who disputed     with Ibraaheem (Abraham) about his Lord (Allaah), because Allaah had given him the kingdom? When Ibraaheem (Abraham) said (to him): ‘My Lord (Allaah)     is He Who gives life and causes death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem (Abraham) said, ‘Verily, Allaah brings the sun from the     east; then bring it you from the west.’ So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allaah guides not the people, who are Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:258]</p>\n<p>There is no story about him and any child     that can be proven, as far as we know.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if you are asking about the story of the     believing boy and the kaafir king, and how the boy was killed and the people believed in Allaah, and they bore persecution for that, this is the     story of the people of the ditch, which was narrated by Muslim (3005) from the hadeeth of Suhayb (may Allaah be pleased with him), which says that     the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among those who came before you there lived a king who had a (court) sorcerer. As he (the sorcerer) grew     old, he said to the king: ‘I have grown old, so send some young boy to me so that I may teach him magic.’ He (the king) sent a boy to him so that     he might train him (in magic). On his way to the sorcerer he (the boy) met a monk and sat with him. He (the boy) listened to his (the monk's) talk     and was impressed by it. So whenever he went to the sorcerer he would pass by the monk and sit with him. And when he came to the sorcerer, he (the     sorcerer) beat him. He complained about it to the monk and he said to him: ‘When you feel afraid of the sorcerer, say: My family made me late. And     when you feel afraid of your family, say: The sorcerer made me late.’ It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way     of the people. He (the young boy) said: I shall find out today whether the sorcerer or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O     Allaah, if the affairs of the monk are dearer to You than the affairs of the sorcerer, bring death to this animal so that the people will be able     to move about freely. He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people were able to pass freely. He (the boy) then came to that monk and     told him (what had happened). The monk said: My son, today you are better than me. Your affairs have reached a stage where I think that you will     be soon put to the test, and in case you are put to the test do not reveal my identity. That young man began to heal the blind and those suffering     from leprosy and he began to cure people of (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king, who had become blind, heard about him, he came     to him with numerous gifts and said: If you heal me, all these things here will be yours. He said: I myself do not heal anyone; it is Allaah Who     heals. If you believe in Allaah, I shall also pray to Allaah to heal you. He believed in Allaah and Allaah healed him. He came to the king and sat     by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. He asked, Do you have any Lord other     than me? He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allaah; so he (the king) took hold of him and tortured him until he revealed the identity of the boy.     The boy was then summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so proficient in your magic that you     heal the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not heal anyone; it is Allah Who heals.     He (the king) took hold of him and began to torture him. So he revealed the identity of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to     him: Turn back from your religion. But he refused to do so. He (ordered) a saw to be brought and he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head     and cut it until it fell apart. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion, but he refused to     do so. So the saw was placed in the middle of his head and it was cut until it fell apart. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn     back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. He said to them: Take him to such and such a     mountain; make him climb that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down     the mountain). So they took him and made him climb the mountain and he said: O Allaah, save me from them however You will. The mountain began to     shake and they all fell down, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said:     Allaah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him away in a small boat and when you     reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they     took him and he said: O Allaah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was not long before the boat overturned and they were drowned but     he came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allaah has saved me from them. He also said     to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and     crucify me on the trunk (of a tree). Then take an arrow from my quiver and say: In the name of Allaah, the Lord of the boy; then shoot an arrow     and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people to an open plain and crucified him (the boy) on the trunk     of a tree. Then he took an arrow from his quiver, placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allaah, the Lord of the boy; he then     shot an arrow and it hit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and he died. The people said: We     believe in the Lord of this boy, we believe in the Lord of this boy, we believe in the Lord of this boy. Some people came to the king and said to     him: Do you realize that you what feared has happened? All the people now believe (in the Lord of the boy). He (the king) commanded ditches to be     dug at the entry-points of the roads. When these ditches were dug, and fires was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who does not turn     back from his (the boy's) religion will be thrown in the fire or they will be told to jump in it. So they started to do that until a woman came     with her child and she hesitated to jump into the fire. Then her child said to her: O mother, be patient, for you are following the Truth.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your saying in your question “Hazrat     Ibraaheem” is an innovated expression which is best avoided, because for the Prophets (peace be upon them) there is an expression which is used     only for them, namely “al-salaatu wa’l-salaamu ‘alayhim (blessings and peace be upon them). There is scholarly consensus on this point, as was     narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Jala’ al-Afhaam from Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on them both)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on the imam walking in the direction of the qiblah to reach the microphone so that the people can hear him",
      "question": "<p>During Taraweeh prayers, the electricity cut out. Because of that, we started to pray in the rear part of the mosque, and that was because of severe heat. During the prayer, the electricity started working again, and suddenly the imam began to walk, whilst reciting, across a large distance, approximately 25 meters, in the direction of the qiblah, in order to reach the microphone, but as members of the congregation we did not follow him in that. After the prayer, we asked him: What made you do that? And he said that he moved in order to reach the microphone, because after the electricity came back and the fans began to work again, perhaps the women on the upper level might not be able to hear his voice properly. Please advise us about the issue of his moving across this distance and how permissible it is. What are the limits on moving whilst praying? Does it make a difference whether the prayer is obligatory or voluntary? How much may a person move (during the prayer) in the case of necessity?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is permissible to move whilst praying if that is in the interests of the prayer, even if that entails a great deal of movement. al-Bukhaari (403) and Muslim (526) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar said: Whilst the people were praying Fajr in Quba’, someone came to them and said: Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) last night and he was commanded to face towards the Ka‘bah, so face towards it. They were facing towards Syria, so they turned to face the Ka‘bah&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is permissible to move (whilst praying) if that is in the interests of the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (12/354)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moving during the prayer is divided into five categories, according to the reason for it. If the reason for it is something obligatory, then moving is obligatory. If the reason for it is something prohibited, then moving is prohibited, and so on. For more information concerning that, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12683\">12683</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, with regard to the imam’s moving forward in the direction of the qiblah in order to reach the microphone so that the women could hear his recitation and takbeer, if his voice was not reaching the women or there was excessive difficulty in enabling the women to hear the recitation of the imam, then his action was correct and Islamically prescribed, because it was in the interests of the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (922) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying with the door closed, then I came and asked for it to be opened, so he walked and opened it for me, then he went back to the place where he was praying. And he mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qiblah.</p>\n<p>Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Khuzaymah (827) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying when a sheep passed in front of him and he raced with it by moving towards the qiblah (to prevent it walking in front of him), until he pressed his stomach against the wall (which was in the direction of the qiblah).</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sifat as-Salaah (p. 83)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and stood on his left, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) moved him and made him stand on his right.</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (138) and Muslim (763).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the women could hear his voice without amplification, but they would hear it more clearly and better with amplification, then what he did was not proper and in fact was extremely makrooh (disliked), because he did a lot of movement that he did not need to do, which might have resulted in distraction of the worshippers during the prayer, and caused confusion during the prayer and led to them disputing after the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the limits on moving during the prayer, the guideline is that it is permissible if it is in the interests of the prayer, even if it is a great deal of movement. But if it is not in the interests of the prayer and there is no need for that, then it is makrooh even if it is a little movement, and the prayer is rendered invalid by it if there is a great deal of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf (2/129):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Actions which are usually regarded as being a great deal and that are not part of the prayer render it invalid whether that is done deliberately or otherwise. It should be noted that the prayer is rendered invalid by a great deal of movement that is done deliberately, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion that I know of concerning that. It is also invalidated by that (great deal of movement) if it is done absentmindedly, according to the correct view, and it was narrated by the commentator and others that there was consensus on this point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is meant by the prayer being rendered invalid by a great deal of movement is if there is no need for that. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sunnah is for the believer to focus on his prayer with proper humility, both mentally and physically, whether it is an obligatory or supererogatory prayer, because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Successful indeed are the believers</p>\n<p>Those who offer their Salat (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness”</p>\n<p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no difference in the rulings between obligatory and supererogatory prayers except in matters for which there is specific evidence. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whatever invalidates an obligatory prayer also invalidates a voluntary prayer.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni (2/47).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there may be more causes for movement during a supererogatory prayer than in an obligatory prayer, because supererogatory prayers are usually done at home, which makes it more likely that some urgent matter may arise which requires the worshipper to move, in contrast to the obligatory prayers which are usually done in the mosque,as we have seen above in the hadith about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) opening the door for ‘Aa’ishah. Ibn Hazm also narrated in al-Muhalla (2/126) from Mu‘aadhah al-‘Adawiyyah that ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers used to instruct her servant to share out the broth, and she would pass in front of her whilst she was praying, and she would gesture her to add more; and she would instruct that something be given to a poor person, gesturing to that effect whilst she was praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated from Mu‘aadhah from ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers that she stood up to pray wearing a chemise and headcover, and she pointed to the wrapper and I handed it to her; there were other women with her and she gestured to them with her hand to have some food – i.e., whilst she was praying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The extent to which it is permissible to move whilst praying is known by the extent of the need to do so. If the need is something essential, such as moving in the interests of the prayer, or moving to kill a snake or a scorpion whilst praying, or moving to save someone from drowning or dying, then there is no blame on the worshipper for that, and in fact he may be instructed to do it.</p>\n<p>But if the need to move whilst praying is not essential, then the ruling on the movement is connected to that, and it varies according to the reason for it, as you will see by referring to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/12683\">12683</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, what appears to us to be the case is that there is no blame on the imam for what he did in his prayer, if there was a problem in his voice reaching the women. What the people praying behind him should have done was to follow him in his prayer, especially since it was not clear to them for certain whether he was mistaken in doing that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "His parents refuse to let him shorten his lower garments. Should he obey them?",
      "question": "<p>My parents won’t let me shorten my lower garments (so that they do not come down below my ankles). Should I obey them or not?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah has commanded us to honour our parents in many places in His Book, such as when He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do”</p>\n<p>[al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]</p>\n<p>The greatest of rights are the rights of Allah, after which come the rights of created beings, foremost among which are the rights of parents. Hence Allah mentions His rights and parents’ rights together in many verses of the Holy Qur’aan, such as when He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.”</p>\n<p>[al-Isra’ 17:23]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obeying parents is obligatory unless they enjoin sin, in which case they should not be obeyed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4340; Muslim, 1840; Ahmad, 1098. Isbaal or letting the lower garment hang below the ankles is a major sin, so you should not obey them if they tell you to do that. But you can wear your clothes at the longest permissible length so that they do not touch the ankles, then you will not be disobeying your Lord by doing that, and you will not be going against your parents’ wishes, because it is not a condition of shortening the lower garment that it should be at mid-calf length, rather you can obey the rule of sharee’ah by not letting your clothes touch your ankles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If they insist that your clothes should be longer than ankle length, then speak to them nicely and try to convince them, but do not disobey Allah for their sake by letting your clothes hang below the ankles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal al-Shaykh was asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is the ruling on isbaal (letting the clothes hang below the ankles)? Is it permissible to obey my father when he wants me to let my clothes hang below the ankles?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Isbaal is haraam, indeed it is one of the major sins. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever allows his garment to trail along the ground out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” And he mentioned the three whom Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment, among whom is the one who allows his garment to hang below his ankles. The one who does this is disobeying Allah and transgressing His sacred limits, so he has to repent to Allah. He will be punished because Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be punished because he is given a warning of Hell fire, which indicates that isbaal is one of the major sins, Moreover there is nothing good in isbaal, because it damages the clothes and may make the person stumble, as ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the young man whom he saw allowing his garment to hang below his ankles – who came to visit ‘Umar in his final sickness – “O young man, lift up your lower garment for it will make your garment last longer and is more obedient to your Lord.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to obeying your parents, parents are not to be obeyed if that involves disobeying Allah. If they tell you to let your garment hang below your ankles, then you should disobey them, because isbaal is a major sin and there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fataawah Majallat al-Da’wah, issue no. 1741&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Why Do We Need Religion?",
      "question": "<p>Why do people need religion? Isn’t it enough to have (man-made) laws that will regulate people’s lives?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#Why_do_we_need_religion\">Why do we need religion?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#How_to_attain_full_knowledge\">How to attain full knowledge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Religion_is_a_protective_shield_for_society\">Religion is a protective shield for society</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Belief_and_faith_regulate_man\">Belief and faith regulate man</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"Why_do_we_need_religion\">Why do we need religion?</span></h3>\n<p>Man’s need for <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21525\" target=\"_blank\">religion</a> is greater than his need for any of the other necessities of life, because man needs to know what pleases Allah and what angers Him; he needs to act in his own interests and to ward off things that will harm him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/210742\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> is what distinguishes between actions that will bring benefit and actions that will cause harm. This is Allah’s justice towards His creation, and His light which shines for His slaves. People cannot live without laws (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/282538\" target=\"_blank\">Shari`ah</a> ) to help them distinguish between what they should and should not do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because man has a will, he has to know what he wants, is it beneficial or harmful? Is it good for him or bad for him? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of these things may be known instinctively, some of it may be known by working it out in a rational manner, and some of it may only be known from the teachings and guidance of the messengers. (See al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 213, 214; Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah, vol. 2, p. 383)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No matter how impressive and attractive the atheist, materialist schools of thought may be, and no matter how many ideas and theories there may be, individuals and societies can never do without the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/232218\" target=\"_blank\">true religion</a> , they can never answer the needs of body and soul. The further the individual sinks into those ways, the more certain it becomes that he cannot find security or quench his thirst, and that there is no way out except through the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9607\" target=\"_blank\">true religion</a> .</p>\n<p>Ernest Renan says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is possible that everything we love could disappear and that rational thinking, science and industry could cease to exist, but it is impossible that religion could be eliminated. Rather it will remain as proof that materialistic thought which wants to restrict man to the narrow path of the base life of this world is false.” (See al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, p. 87)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muhammad Farid Wajdi says:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is impossible that the idea of religion could diminish, because it is the most refined inclination of the soul and its noblest emotion, in addition to being the inclination that ennobles man. Rather this inclination will increase and the religious nature of man will remain so long as he retains that reason which enables him to distinguish between beauty and ugliness. This instinct will increase according to his level of rationality.” (Al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, p. 87) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If man is far away from his Lord, then according to his level of knowledge and understanding he will realize the extent of his ignorance of his Lord and His attributes, and his ignorance of his own self and what is good for him or bad for him, what leads to bliss and what leads to doom, and his ignorance of such basic matters as astronomy, mathematics and the like.&nbsp; At this point the wise man will move from the state of arrogance and pride to humility and submission, and will realize that behind all this knowledge is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, and that behind nature there is an Almighty Creator. This truth compels the objective seeker to believe in the unseen and acknowledge the true religion, and to respond to the call of human nature and innate instinct. If a person fails to do that he is going against his innate nature and sinking to the level of the dumb animals. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus we may conclude that following the true religion – that which is based on belief in Allah Alone (Tawhid) and worshipping Him in the way that He has prescribed – is an essential element of life if man is to be a true slave to the Lord of the Worlds, and to attain happiness and be free of tiredness and exhaustion in this world and in the Hereafter. It is essential in order to perfect man’s rational thinking. In this way alone can reason fulfil its desires; without it man cannot fulfil his higher ambitions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an essential element for purifying the soul and disciplining the emotions, for in religion the noble emotions find fertile ground and an inexhaustible spring to help them achieve their goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an essential element for strengthening willpower and supplying it with the greatest motives and power to resist the factor of helplessness and despair.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"How_to_attain_full_knowledge\">How to attain full knowledge</span></h3>\n<p>On this basis, if there is anyone who says that man is sociable in nature, we must say that man is religious by nature. (See al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, 84, 98), because man has two strengths, knowledge and willpower, and his ultimate happiness depends on him acquiring both. Full knowledge can only be attained by knowing the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing Allah, the Creator and Provider Who created man from nothing and bestowed blessings upon him.</li>\n<li>Knowing the names and attributes of Allah, and the effect of these names upon His slaves.</li>\n<li>Knowing the way to reach Him.</li>\n<li>Knowing the obstacles that prevent man from knowing this way and the great blessings to which it leads.</li>\n<li>Knowing yourself in a true sense, and knowing what your soul needs, what is good for it and what is bad for it, and knowing its faults and shortcomings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These five matters will complete a person’s knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Achieving perfect will power can only be achieved by paying attention to the rights of Allah over His slaves and fulfilling them sincerely, adhering to that and bearing witness to the blessings of Allah. These two strengths can only be perfected with the help of Allah, so man needs Allah to guide him to the Straight Path to which He guides His close friends. (See al-Fawaid, p, 18-19)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion_is_a_protective_shield_for_society\">Religion is a protective shield for society</span></h3>\n<p>Once we know that the true religion is the divine support that directs the potentials of man, then we know that religion is also a protective shield for society, because human life can only be strong when there is cooperation among the members of society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This cooperation can only be achieved by means of a system that regulates the relationships between them, defines their duties and protects their rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This system needs a deterrent that will deter one from transgressing and encourage one to follow the system, one that carries weight in people’s hearts and prevents them from overstepping its limits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is this authority? I say that there is no power on earth that can match the power of religion in protecting the sanctity of the system, guaranteeing the coherence of society and the stability of its system, and providing the means of peace and security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reason for that is that man differs from all other living beings in that his voluntary actions and dealings are governed by something that can be neither seen nor heard, namely the religious belief that disciplines the heart and guides his faculties. Man is inevitably led by his belief, whether it is sound or corrupt. If his belief is sound, everything else will also be sound, but if it is corrupt then everything else will also be corrupt.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Belief_and_faith_regulate_man\">Belief and faith regulate man</span></h3>\n<p>Belief and faith are the two things that regulate man and – as we can see in most cases – they are of two types:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Belief in the importance of virtue and human dignity, and other abstract values which make noble souls feel ashamed to go against their principles even if they are spared the consequences of physical punishment.</li>\n<li>Belief in Allah and that He is always watching and knows what is in our hearts, and that He knows secrets and that which is more hidden. The authority of SharI`ah is based on its commands and prohibitions, and makes a person feel shy before Allah, either out of love for Him, or out of fear of Him, or both. Undoubtedly this type of faith is the stronger of the two and carries more weight in human hearts. It is more able to resist the storms of desire and the upheavals of emotion, and it has more effect on the hearts of the masses and the elite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this reason, religion is the best guarantee for ensuring that people will deal with one another on a basis of fairness and justice, and hence it is a social necessity. It comes as no surprise that the relationship of religion to the ummah is like that of the heart to the body. Nowadays we see that there are many religions in the world, and each people has its religion which they cling to. What is the true religion which will fulfil the aspirations of the human soul? What are the guidelines of the true religion?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on getting a “covered” credit card that stipulates in order to obtain it that one should have a bank account and one cannot withdraw money using the credit card unless there is already credit in the credit card account. Please note that the validity of this card is two years only, and they charge an annual fee of 70 Libyan dinars.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with using a “covered” or prepaid credit card, and there is nothing wrong with the company that issues it charging a fee for it that is higher than the actual cost, because this is a fee in return for offering this service. Rather, what is not allowed is charging more than the actual costs incurred in the case of an “non-covered” credit card, whether the additional amount is added to the fee for issuing it or to the transaction fee, because when the bank gives money to a customer when the credit card is not covered, this is actually a loan to him, and it is not permissible for the bank to charge interest or make a profit on this loan; it should be limited only to charging the actual costs involved in issuing it.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that it is not permissible to deposit money in riba-based banks, even if it is a deposit into a current account, because the bank uses the money to help it to carry out its transactions, both those that are permissible and those that are haraam. This is the rule except in cases of necessity, where one has to do deposit money in the bank so as to protect it and other cases of need, when there is no Islamic bank. We have previously quoted the words of the scholars concerning that.</p>\n<p>Based on that, if there is no Islamic bank that offers credit cards and you need to use one, then it is permissible to open an account in the riba-based bank, but it should be limited to depositing enough to cover the credit card.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Didn’t the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one punishes with fire except Allah”? Therefore isn’t burning haraam according to Islamic teachings? But in fatwa no. 38622 you stated that ‘Ali, Abu Bakr and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed burned those who committed the sin of homosexuality; were they not sinning by doing that? Even if we assume that someone is killed in a retaliatory punishment (qisaas), isn’t qisaas by burning haraam?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is proven in the texts that punishment by burning with fire is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burned some people. News of that reached Ibn ‘Abbaas and he said: If it were me, I would not have burned them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not punish with the punishment of Allah.” And I would have executed them as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, then execute him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3017).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent us on a mission and said: “If you find So and so, and So and so, then burn them with fire.” Then the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when we were about to leave: “I had commanded you to burn So and so, and So and so. But verily no one punishes with fire except Allah. So if you find them, execute them.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3016)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the hadith concerning this topic, what appears to be the case is that the prohibition in it indicates that this act is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Fath al-Baari (6/150).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This prohibition on punishing anyone by burning with fire is general in application, but the majority of scholars made an exception in the case of burning with fire by way of retaliatory punishment (qisaas) and making the punishment fit the crime. If someone burns another person then it is permissible, according to this view, to punish him by burning him, by way of retaliatory punishment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They quoted as evidence for that the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is with Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:194]</p>\n<p>“And if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of Allah), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.)”</p>\n<p>[an-Nahl 16:126].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The basic principle says that acting upon two sound texts that have not been abrogated is better than overlooking one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/147416\">147416</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Therefore the majority of fuqaha’ think that it is permissible to burn with fire by way of retaliatory punishment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One group of scholars said: Whoever burns is to be burnt. This is also the view of Maalik, the scholars of Madinah, ash-Shaafa‘i and his companions, Ahmad and Ishaaq.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from at-Tawdeeh li Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Saheeh (18/61)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what is mentioned in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38622\">38622</a> about ‘Ali, Abu Bakr and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed burning those who committed the crime of homosexuality, it may be said in response to that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), especially the most prominent figures among them, such as the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs and others, have been commended by Allah in the Qu’ran and their virtues have been proven in the Sunnah. All of that is because of their assiduous compliance and obedience to the commands of Islam, their steadfastness in adhering to them, and their efforts to call people to the faith, until they met Allah, may He be exalted, when they were like that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the case of those who are of such high standing, if we come across a verdict or fatwa of theirs that appears to contradict an Islamic text, then in this case we must follow the steps outlined below:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firstly: we should establish the soundness or otherwise of what is attributed to them. It is not permissible to attribute anything to a person unless we are certain that it is soundly proven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The incidents of killing with fire that are attributed to the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) are not all soundly narrated. With regard to what is mentioned in fatwa no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38622\">38622</a>, to which you referred, this fatwa was to explain the views of the scholars concerning the punishment of one who commits the immoral act of homosexuality, in which we quoted all the views concerning the method of punishment for this immoral act.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Burning was mentioned, quoting those who said that it was proven in reports from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), such as Ibn al-Qayyim, who stated definitively that this incident was proven, as was quoted from him in the fatwa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there are those who disagreed with Ibn al-Qayyim and regarded the report of this story as da‘eef (weak), such as al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him), who said in as-Sunan al-Kubra (17/219): This is mursal. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that mursal is one of the types of da‘eef hadiths.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to burning, Ibn Abi’d-Dunya narrated via al-Bayhaqi and via Ibn al-Munkadir that Khaalid ibn al-Waleed wrote to Abu Bakr, telling him that he had found a man among one of the Arab tribes with whom men would have intercourse as with a woman. Abu Bakr called the Sahaabah together and asked them about that, and the one who had the strictest view was ‘Ali, who said: We think that we should burn him with fire, and the Sahaabah agreed on that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I say: This is da‘eef jiddan (very weak). If it were saheeh, it would constitute definitive proof.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from ad-Diraayah fi Takhreej Ahaadeeth al-Hidaayah (2/103)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd commented on this report as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The verdict of the leading scholars is that it is a mursal hadith, as was stated clearly by al-Bayhaqi and ash-Shawkaani.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Hudood wa’t-Ta‘zeeraat ‘inda Ibn al-Qayyim (p. 175)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To sum up, this incident is not soundly or definitively proven.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly: in cases where a fatwa or verdict is soundly attributed, as in the story of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) burned some people. News of that reached Ibn ‘Abbaas and he said: If it were me, I would not have burned them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not punish with the punishment of Allah.” And I would have executed them as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, then execute him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3017).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In an incident such as this, there must have been a reason that made ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) issue the verdict of burning. There may have been the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Perhaps the hadith prohibiting burning did not reach him. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were just like any other people: one of them may have missed out on some knowledge, according to his situation, as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar missed out on some issues of knowledge that others had learned, even though they were superior to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all), and others also missed out on some issues of knowledge and hadiths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is well known.</p>\n<p>Al-Haazimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ikrimah that ‘Ali burned some people who had apostatised from Islam. News of that reached Ibn ‘Abbaas and he said: I would not have burned them with fire, for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not punish with the punishment of Allah.” And I would have executed them as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, then execute him.”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said: News of that reached ‘Ali and he said: Woe to Ibn ‘Abbaas!</p>\n<p>This hadith is proven and saheeh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They said: The fact that ‘Ali was surprised by the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas indicates that news of this abrogation had not reached him; when it did reach him, he adopted that view. Were it not for that, he would have objected to what Ibn ‘Abbaas said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from al-I‘tibaar fi’n-Naaskih wa’l-Mansookh min al-Athaar (p. 194)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Perhaps he had forgotten the hadith that prohibited it, and did not remember it, and the one who forgets is excused and is not sinning.</p>\n<p>There are similar cases in the biographies of the Sahaabah in which one of them forgot a hadith and others reminded him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Adam al-Ethiopi said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be that he said it – i.e., when ‘Ali said “Woe to Ibn ‘Abbaas!” – by way of approving of what he said, and that Ibn ‘Abbaas remembered what ‘Ali had forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Dhakheerat al-‘Uqba fi Sharh al-Mujtaba (31/385).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Perhaps he understood the prohibition as meaning that it was merely disliked, not prohibited, as was the view favoured by some of the scholars.</p>\n<p>Az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Woe to Ibn ‘Abbaas!” It may be that he did not agree with his objection, and thought that the prohibition meant that it was makrooh (disliked), because ‘Ali thought that burning was permissible, as did Khaalid ibn al-Waleed and others, adopting a stern stance towards the disbelievers, and by way of inflicting a severe punishment on them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh al-Muwatta’ (3/193-194)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is on the basis of reasons such as these that we may interpret the report that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) burned those who committed the immoral act of homosexuality, if the report is proven to be sound.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It should be noted that not one of the leading scholars – who are widely accepted among the ummah – deliberately went against the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his Sunnah in any matter, minor or major.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are unanimously and definitely agreed that it is obligatory to follow the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that the opinion of anyone may be accepted or rejected, except the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if one of them holds a view, and there is a saheeh hadith to the contrary, then he must have an excuse for not following the hadith. All excuses fall into three categories:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. That he did not believe that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that.</p>\n<p>2. That he did not believe that he was referring to that issue when he said it.</p>\n<p>3. That he believed that that ruling had been abrogated.</p>\n<p>These three categories are main categories and there may be sub-categories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Raf‘ al-Malaam ‘an al-A’immah al-A‘laam (p. 8-9)</p>\n<p>To sum up: what may be stated definitively is that the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not deliberately go against the prohibition on punishment by burning. What has been narrated from some of them (concerning that) is either not saheeh (sound), or it is saheeh but they are excused for what they did on the basis of ijtihaad, because they were qualified to engage therein.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the mujtahid strives his utmost to issue a correct verdict and fatwa but makes a mistake, he is rewarded and is not regarded as having sinned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If a judge passes a judgement having striven to reach a decision, and he gets it right, he will have two rewards. If he passes a judgement having striven to reach a decision and he gets it wrong, he will have one reward.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7352) and Muslim (1716).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information, please see Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (4/491-492)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
