      "title": "Can charity be given to one who is able to earn a living?",
      "question": "<p>We are people who sponsor a number of poor families using charitable donations that come to us from good people. In some of these poor families there are individuals (men and women) who are able to work, but they have got used to receiving charity every month, and they have started to refuse work if it is offered to them. The jobs that they have refused include sewing, working as a janitor, working in a school, and selling food in the school or neighbourhood. <br />\n<br />\nMy question is: <br />\n<br />\nBy giving this money, have we handled it in the proper way? Have we become a cause of their laziness in seeking a livelihood? If we stop giving them money will we be committing a sin?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What you are doing of sponsoring a number of poor families is     a good deed for which you are to be thanked, and we ask Allah to accept it     from you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What people give of charity is of two types:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    1.</p>\n<p>    Obligatory charity, namely zakaah. It is not permissible to     give this to anyone except those whom Allah mentioned in the verse     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the     Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect     (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined     (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for     Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and     for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty     imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tawbah 9:60]</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to give zakaah to one who is able to     work and earn enough to suffice him, because the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no share of it [zakaah] for the     one who is independent of means or one who is strong and able to earn a     living.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1633; classed as saheeh by     al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 876.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    2. </p>\n<p>    Mustahabb charity, which is what a person gives other than     zakaah. It is permissible to give this to both poor and rich, but it is     better to give it to the one who is in need of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is     permissible to give voluntary charity to the rich, and there is no     difference of scholarly opinion on this point. It is permissible to give it     to them and the giver will be rewarded for it, but it is better to give it     to the needy. Our companions said: It is better for the rich person to     refrain from taking it and he should not ask for it, and it is not     permissible for the rich person to accept voluntary charity, making a show     of being poor. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Majmoo‘, 6/236&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information please see the answer to question number    <a href=\"/en/answers/82673\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">82673</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if the money that you are giving to those     families is zakaah money, it is not permissible to give it to them, except     those who are poor and not able to earn a living.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the money that you are giving to them is mustahabb     charity, then it is permissible for you to give it to them, although it is     better to give mustahabb charity to one who is poor, so as to meet his     needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You will not be sinning if you do not give this money to     those who are able to earn a living, because they are not in need of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the givers of the money stipulate that their charity is     only to be given to the poor, in this case you will have to give it to the     poor only, and it is not permissible for you to give it to someone who is     independent of means.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You should advise those who are able to earn a living to stop     asking of people and to do work from which they can earn money that will     spare them from having to ask of people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on calling a boy Rukaan, because there are people who say that this is the name of one of the gates of Hell?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Choosing a good name is a right that the child has over his father, because a name is very important in a person’s life. It refers to the person and it is essential in order to communicate with him. It is an adornment and a symbol of the one who is named, and he will be called by it in this world and in the Hereafter. People get an impression of the person from his name, so the name should be good and appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The etiquette that should be followed when choosing a name for a child has been explained in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7180\">7180</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with calling a child Rukaan. Arab names include Rukaan, Rukaanah and Rakeen. We have not found any indication that it is the name of one of the gates of Hell, but if that is proven then it is makrooh to call a child by this name.</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He claims that it is not obligatory to follow the Prophet in everything",
      "question": "<p>What do you think of someone who says that it is not obligatory to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in everything, because he was human and he may try to work something out, then get it wrong or get it right?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Obeying the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is obligatory; in fact it is one of the fundamentals of faith, as the Quran indicates. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{O you who believe, obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those of you who are in authority. If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you [truly] believe in Allah and the Last Day; that is better and more seemly in the end}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:59]</p>\n<p>{Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and be on your guard. But if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}&nbsp;[al-Ma’idah 5:92]</p>\n<p>{We did not send any Messenger except to be obeyed by Allah’s leave}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:64].</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that no one truly believes until he makes the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) judge concerning what he faces in his life of novel events, and he finds no reservation in his heart towards his ruling, and he accepts it wholeheartedly. Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:65].</p>\n<p>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his <em>Tafsir</em>, 2/349:</p>\n<p>Regarding the words {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them}: here Allah, may He be exalted, swears by His divine essence that no one truly believes until he refers judgement to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him in all his affairs, for whatever he rules is the truth which the believer must accept wholeheartedly, both inwardly and outwardly. Hence Allah says: {then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}. That is, when they refer to you for judgement, then they must obey you inwardly and not feel any reservations about your verdict, and they must submit to it both outwardly and inwardly. So they should submit to it completely, without any reluctance, objection or dispute, as it is narrated in the hadith: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of you truly believes until his inclinations are in accordance with what I have brought.” (End quote)</p>\n<p>In his beneficial and blessed book <em>Riyadh as-Salihin</em>, Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled: the Chapter on the command to adhere to the Sunnah and the etiquette learned therefrom.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, he quoted a number of verses from the Quran which are indicative of this important principle of faith, as clear evidence in which there is no confusion or doubt:</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{Whatever the Messenger gives you [of the gains, or of instructions], accept it, and whatever he forbids to you, refrain from it}&nbsp;[al-Hashr 59:7]</p>\n<p>{nor does he speak of his own accord;</p>\n<p>It is but divine inspiration}&nbsp;[an-Najm 53:3-4]</p>\n<p>{Say: If you love Allah then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins}&nbsp;[Al `Imran 3:31]</p>\n<p>{Verily, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example for those who look with hope to Allah and the Last Day}&nbsp;[al-Ahzab 33:21]</p>\n<p>{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:65]]</p>\n<p>{If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:59].</p>\n<p>The scholars said: What is meant is referring to the Quran and Sunnah.</p>\n<p>And Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah}&nbsp;[an-Nisa’ 4:80]</p>\n<p>{And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path,</p>\n<p>The path of Allah}&nbsp;[ash-Shura 42:52-53]</p>\n<p>{So let those who go against his command beware lest some calamity strikes them or a painful punishment befalls them}&nbsp;[an-Nur 24:63]</p>\n<p>{And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom}&nbsp;[al-Ahzab 33:34]</p>\n<p>and there are many similar verses. (End quote).</p>\n<p>In the same chapter, he also quoted a number of hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which affirm this principle. These hadiths include the following:</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” It was said: Who would refuse, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari) It is very strange for someone to claim that following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not obligatory, when Allah, may He be exalted, has connected guidance and success to following and obeying him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>\n<p>{So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided}&nbsp;[al-A`raf 7:158]</p>\n<p>{If you obey him, you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}&nbsp;[an-Nur 24:54].</p>\n<p>One of the things that the Muslim must believe is that the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is his path – meaning his words and actions regarding religious matters – is infallible.</p>\n<p>If the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a decision on the basis of his personal opinion, and it turned out to be incorrect, revelation would come down straightaway to correct it and show what Allah wanted and what His ruling was concerning a specific, new development. This is what is proven in the Quran, in passages such as the following:</p>\n<p>{It is not befitting for a Prophet to take captives until he has thoroughly suppressed [the enemy] in the land. You desire the fleeting gains of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise.</p>\n<p>Were it not for a prior decree from Allah, a grievous punishment would have befallen you for what you took [of ransom].</p>\n<p>So enjoy what you have gained in war as lawful and good, but fear Allah; verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}</p>\n<p>[al-Anfal 8:67-69]</p>\n<p>{It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire</p>\n<p>And the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient}&nbsp;[at-Tawbah 9:113-114]</p>\n<p>{O Prophet, why do you prohibit [for yourself] that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>\n<p>Allah has already prescribed for you a way of releasing yourselves from your oaths. Allah is your Guardian, and He is All-Knowing, Most Wise}&nbsp;[at-Tahrim 66:1-2].</p>\n<p>Conclusion: the one who raised this objection has not understood anything about following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the importance thereof in the religion of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He has not understood the evidence that points to that, and when he objected to this fundamental principle, he has not objected with something that will benefit him or that has anything to do with the issue under discussion.</p>\n<p>Would that this doubter, if he is confused about something, would refer the matter to people of authority, such as the scholars and jurists, so that they could respond to the doubt that he has in his mind.</p>\n<p>May Allah show us the path of guidance and enable us to follow it.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on consuming hemp protein",
      "question": "<p>I want to ask about protein made from the hemp plant, which can be found in sporting goods stores in the UK. Is it permissible to consume this protein as a natural source of energy? This substance does not contain THC.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-‘Arabiyyah al-‘Aalamiyyah:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Hemp (also known as Cannabis) is a plant that is sometimes     cultivated for its strong fibres, which are obtained from the woody stems of     the plant and are used in making string and various kinds of rope.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Growing hemp is banned in most countries because it is     possible to obtain a psychoactive substance from it, known as marijuana or     hashish. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The cannabis plant has a serious effect on the body, hence     the fuqaha’ in the past and at present have stated that it is forbidden to     consume it, as has also been stated by legal systems worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    See also the answer to question no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/66227\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">66227</a></p>\n<p>    The psychoactive substance in cannabis that has an effect on     the brain and nervous system is that which the questioner referred to by its     acronym THC, which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is known that this psychoactive substance is not present     in leaves other than the flowering or fruiting tops, and it is not present     in the seeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The military doctor Muhammad Fathi ‘Eed (may Allah guide him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The cannabis plant is one of which cultivation is banned in     accordance with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, which was     ratified by the Protocol of 1972. That is with the exception of a small     quantity that a country that is signatory to the Convention may need for     scientific research purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Convention clarified in clause (c) that what is meant by     “cannabis” is any plant of the genus Cannabis, whether it is male or female,     cultivated for the production of fibre or the production of drugs…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs it says:     “Cannabis” means the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant     (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops) from which     the resin has not been extracted, by whatever name they may be designated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Convention stated that this definition does not include     cannabis leaves that are not attached to the tops and it does not include     the seeds. End quote from Jareemat Ta‘aati al-Mukhaddiraat fi’l-Qanoon     al-Muqaaran, 1/145, 146&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if the protein that is derived from the     cannabis or hemp plant is taken from one of these two things – other than     the flowering tops and seeds – which are in fact free of THC, then there is     nothing wrong with consuming it, so long as it does not have a negative     effect on the body apart from what may be caused by the psychoactive     substance. This is the general condition that applies to everything that is     available in the market of natural or manufactured substances that claim to     benefit the body by increasing energy. We have discussed this in our answer     concerning the ruling on sports energy drinks. Please see the answer to     question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/163968\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">163968</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "He set aside money for the purpose of Hijrah (migration to a Muslim country) then swore to give it in charity if he fell into sin",
      "question": "<p>I am a muslim residing currently in the lands of disbelief,I was born and brought up in the west. I recently made an intention to do hijra to the lands of islam and muslims and Allah be praised and glorified, i managed to raise some money for my journey, the problem that Im facing and I pray to Allah that you can help me, is that I had a problem with a sin and everytime I committed it, I would regret it, and I would repent, but I would always go back to it and this became a big problem for me, so in order for me to stop I made an oath out of desperation, and I said \" O Allah if I commit this sin again, then I will give the money which I raised to do hijra with, away in charity and I will not offer the expiation for it (kaffarat yameen). (Meaning even if I had a choice to give an expiation, I wouldnt. oblighing myself to give the money)But out of stupidity and foolishness i did it again. what can i do? should i give the money and start raising the money again or could i repent for my mistakes and head towards perparing for hijra in the way off Allah ? .</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      You did well when you formed the intention to leave that       country and migrate to a Muslim country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because you were able to collect the money needed for travel,     but you swore that oath, intending to prevent your self from going back to     that sin, then you were overwhelmed by your nafs and you went back to it,     now you have to continue with your plan to migrate and you should not let     the oath that you swore hold you back. What is prescribed in the case of one     who swears an oath then thinks that something else is better than it, is to     do what is better and to offer expiation for his oath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    There is no doubt that the purpose of migration and the good     consequences that will result from it, such as keeping away from temptation     and its people, takes precedence over the harm caused by breaking an oath.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Lawgiver takes into consideration the pros and cons, and     when there is a&nbsp; case in which there are pros and cons, the definite pros     take precedence over the uncertain cons. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 24/269&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Bukhaari (6718) and Muslim (1649) narrated from Abu Moosa     al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and     peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allaah, if Allaah wills, I do not     swear an oath (to do something) then see something better than that, but I     expiate my oath and do that which is better.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Muslim (1650) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be     pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah     be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath (to do something) then sees that     something else is better than it, let him do that and offer expiation for     his oath.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In these hadeeths there is an indication that if a person     swears to do something or not to do something, but breaking his oath is     better than going ahead with it, it is mustahabb for him to break his oath     and he has to offer expiation for that. This is something on which there is     scholarly consensus. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So hasten to leave that land and move to a Muslim country.     This will be more beneficial for you and will be more effective in helping     you to adhere to the straight path than forcing yourself by means of oaths     that you are not able to fulfil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to be sincere in repentance and turning to Allah,     and you have to think positively of Him and renew the covenant by coming     back to Him. Do not lose hope in Him, for no one who pins his hope on Allah     will ever be disappointed. And do not despair of the help and mercy of     Allah. Resolve to strive hard and turn to your Lord with a heart full of     fear and hope.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Remember the words of Allah, may He be exalted     (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Say: O 'Ibâdî (My slaves) who have transgressed against     themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of     Allâh, verily Allâh forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most     Merciful[] </p>\n<p>    And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith     (Islâmic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him, (in Islâm), before the     torment comes upon you, (and) then you will not be helped”</p>\n<p>    [al-Zumar 39:53-54].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    You have to offer kaafarat yameen (expiation for breaking an     oath) for the oath that you broke, and continue with the plan of migration;     spend the money that you have on striving to leave that land and move to a     Muslim land.

As for the cost of making it into jewellery, it is permissible to     delay it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But if what is meant in the question is that you are going to     give the craftsman gold that you already own, so that he can make it into     jewellery, then there is nothing wrong with delaying payment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for     wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like,     same for same, hand to hand.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) said: “Whoever gives more or asks for more has engaged in     riba.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And it is proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) was brought some good-quality dates. He asked about them and     they said: “We used to take one saa’ for two saa’s, and two saa’s for     three.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered     that the transaction be cancelled and he said, “This is the essence of     riba.” Then he told them to sell the inferior dates and to buy good-quality     dates with the dirhams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    From these ahaadeeth we may understand that what the     questioner said about exchanging gold for gold and adding the cost of making     one of them into jewellery is something that is forbidden and is not     permissible. It comes under the heading of riba which the Prophet      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade. The correct way to do     it is to sell the broken gold for a certain price without any other     conditions. After the seller has taken the price, he may then buy the new     gold. It is better to look for the new gold in another place, and if he     cannot find it then he may return to the one who bought from him, and buy it     with dirhams. If it costs more it does not matter. What matters is that     there should not be an exchange of gold for gold with an extra payment, even     if that is for making it into jewellery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This applies if the seller is a merchant. If the merchant is     also a goldsmith he can say: “Take this gold and make it into jewellery for     me (whatever he wants him to make), and I will pay you for that when you     finish making it.” There is nothing wrong with this. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ As’ilah fi Bay’ wa Shira’ al-Dhahab     (no. 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The Shaykh was also asked:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Is it essential to pay for work when collecting the gold (to     the goldsmith) or can we regard it as an ongoing transaction?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It does not have to be     paid up front, because this is payment for work. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ As’ilah fi Bay’ wa Shira’ al-Dhahab     (no. 10). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>           Ibn Katheer said: i.e., the people will be divided into           three groups on the Day of Resurrection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           Al-Tabari said: thus they will be divided into the three           groups mentioned at the end of the soorah at the time when they are           dying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           Then Allaah explained the state of the (three) groups.           He said “those on the Right Hand” to point out how great is their           status and how respected they are.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>           “And those on the Left Hand           (i.e. those who will be given their Record in their left hands)             how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand”;           their being on the left indicates how terrible their situation will           be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And those foremost [(in Islamic Faith of Monotheism           and in performing righteous deeds) in the life of this world on the           very first call for to embrace Islam] will be foremost (in Paradise)”</p>\n<p>[al-Waaq’iah 56:10 – interpretation of           the meaning]</p>\n<p>           This means that those who were foremost in doing good           deeds in this world will be foremost in the Hereafter and will be the           first to enter Paradise. Those who are of this caliber are the ones           who will be closest to Allaah in gardens of delight, in the heights           of ‘Illiyeen, in a lofty status above which there are no higher status.

      "question": "<p>I asked a friend of mine to bring me a watch from the country where he is living, as he was coming to the country where we are studying. In the airport, by mistake someone took his suitcase, and after communicating with the brother, the suitcase was returned to my friend, but the watch was not in the bag, as it had been stolen. We were not able to make contact again with the brother who had taken the suitcase by mistake, and the airline company will not compensate us for the price of the watch, because when my friend filled out the form to report missing items, he forgot to list the watch among the things that were missing.</p>\n<p>My question is:</p>\n<p>Should I pay my friend for the price of the watch? Please note that I gave him approximately three quarters of the price before he went, and I said to him: When you come back, I will give you the rest of the money. Or is he the one who has to return the money to me?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the loss of the bag was due to heedlessness on the part of the person who you entrusted [with the money to buy the watch], such as if he left it in a place where it was vulnerable to theft, or he did not take care to stand over it in the baggage reclaim area, then he is liable and must pay back to you what you gave him towards the cost of the watch.</p>\n<p>If the loss of the watch happened without any negligence on his part, then he is not liable for it, and you must give him the remainder of the money that he paid [for the watch] on your behalf.</p>\n<p>The guideline, as the scholars stated, is that an honest person is not liable unless he transgresses or is negligent.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Kaafi:</p>\n<p>The agent [one appointed to do something on another person’s behalf] is a trustee; he is not liable for the loss or destruction of anything entrusted to his care if he is not negligent, regardless of whether he is being paid for acting an agent or not. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in his commentary on al-Kaafi:</p>\n<p>The correct view is that no trustee is liable except in the case of deliberate transgression or negligence. Trustees are all those who take into their care wealth or property with the permission of an Islamic ruling or the permission of the owner. This is the definition of a trustee; it is anyone who has wealth or property in his care with the permission of the Lawgiver, such as the wakeel (guardian) of an orphan, or with the permission of the owner, such as an agent, hired employee, and the like.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh al-Kaafi (5/125),</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/75568\">75568</a>.</p>\n<p>Our advice to you is to come to some agreement with your friend with which you are both pleased, such as splitting the cost between the two of you, and the like.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
