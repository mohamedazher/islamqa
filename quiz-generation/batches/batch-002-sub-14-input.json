      "title": "When a Traveler By Plane Breaks the Fast",
      "question": "<p>When should the person who is traveling by plane break his fast?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the sun sets and he breaks his fast on the ground, then when the plane takes off he sees the sun, he does not have to refrain from eating and drinking, because he has completed his fast in full, and there is no need to repeat the act of worship after he has finished it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the plane takes off before sunset, and he wants to complete that day’s fast <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20165\" target=\"_blank\">whilst traveling</a> , then he should not break his fast until the sun sets in the place where he is in the air.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for the pilot to take the plane down to a level where the sun cannot be seen so that <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/50758\" target=\"_blank\">the people can break their fast</a> sooner, because this is a kind of trick. But if he descends for a valid technical reason and the disk of the sun disappears, then he should break his fast.&nbsp;(From the fatwas of Shaykh Ibn Baz. See the booklet Sab’un Mas-alah fi’l-Siyam (<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/books/seyam/english.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Seventy Issues related to Fasting</strong></a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/128883\" target=\"_blank\">fasting person</a> is on board an airplane and he finds out through the clock or the telephone that a nearby city has broken the fast, but he can see the sun because the plane is high up, then he is not allowed to break his fast because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;“then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]</p>\n<p>This does not apply in his case so long as he can still see the sun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if he broke his fast in that city after the day ended for him, then the plane took off and he saw the sun, then he should continue to <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/48975\" target=\"_blank\">break his fast</a> because he comes under the ruling of the city from which he took off, where the day ended whilst he was still there.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In another fatwa, the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“If a person is in an airplane <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/27027\" target=\"_blank\">during the day in Ramadan</a> , and he is fasting and wants to continue fasting until night-time, it is not permissible for him to break his fast until the sun has set.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/136-137)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Zakaah on extra gold acquired during the [zakaah] year",
      "question": "<p>If I have enough gold and zakaah has become due on it, but one full (Hijri) year has not yet passed, then at the end of the year the amount (weight) of gold has increased, is the value of zakaah to be worked out on the basis of the weight at the beginning of the year, or at the end of the year with the new weight?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If someone has gold that reaches the minimum threshold at which zakaah becomes due (nisaab), then he buys new gold during the year, or receives it as a gift and the like, then he should start a new year for the newly-acquired gold, from the day he bought it or accepted it as a gift.</p>\n<p>Based on that, he should give zakaah on the old gold when one year has passed, then give zakaah on the new gold when its year has passed, starting with the date it came into his possession.</p>\n<p>If he wishes, he may give zakaah on all the gold when one year has passed for the old gold, in which case he will have given zakaah on the new gold before its year has passed. This is permissible, and it is called giving zakaah in advance.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a case where someone buys new gold and adds it to old gold on which he has to give zakaah.</p>\n<p>He replied: If he buys gold during the year, then it is not to be added to any previous gold with regard to zakaah. Rather he should make a separate year for it. But if he wants to add it to the previous gold and give zakaah on both at the same time, this is fine and it comes under the heading of giving zakaah ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Question: What if the new gold is below the nisaab (minimum threshold)?</p>\n<p>Shaykh: If what he bought is below the minimum threshold, it should be added to the old gold in order to determine whether it reaches the minimum threshold, but with regard to the time at which zakaah becomes due, he may separate them, unless he chooses to give zakaah on both at the same time.</p>\n<p>End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He used to take money without his parents’ knowledge; what should he do now?",
      "question": "<p>I have a very important question, which I hope you can answer. My father has a store in which he sells cards for public telephones. Every time I needed a card I used to tell my father or my mother that I was going to take a card from the store and they would let me do that. But there came a time when I needed a card nearly every day. And I would take a card with the knowledge of the clerk who was working in the store, but I did not tell my father or mother, because I felt that they would never agree to that. When I realized how wrong this was, I never took anything without their knowledge after that. I regretted what I had done and repented to Allaah. Is repentance enough or do I have to tell them what I was doing? Or can I at least take part of my own money and give it to them without them knowing that it was me who gave them this money, because I cannot tell them openly? Can I give them the money until I have paid off what I took, knowing that I do not know the true amount I took because I took so many cards?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    We hope that when you used a lot of these cards it was for     good and permissible purposes, because if it was used for the opposite then     your using them will be compounded by other sins too, so you should pay     attention to this fact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As you have acknowledged that you were wrong to take these     cards without your parents’ permission, you have to repent from doing that –     praise be to Allaah Who has guided you to repent and regret your actions.     But you should understand that there are conditions for repentance, which is     not valid unless they are met. These conditions include: immediately giving     up the forbidden action, resolving not to go back to it, and restoring     people’s rightful property or seeking their forgiveness. You do not have to     tell your father what you did, rather what you have to do is to return the     money in whatever way you can. You should try hard to figure out the value     of the cards you took without your father’s permission, and give this money     to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to accept your repentance and to guide you to     do righteous deeds. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    For more information see the answers to questions no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/43100\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">43100</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/33858\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">33858</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/31234\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">31234</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/40157\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">40157&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Starting a business mainly aimed at supplying food and drink for wedding parties and Christian celebrations",
      "question": "<p>Is it haraam to open a business which caters for weddings, birthdays, christmas parties etc. to cater for any christian festivities?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      It is haraam to start this business, because these celebrations that you       mentioned in the question are haraam, either because of their origins or       because of the evils involved in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to parties for Christian festivals, such as Christmas, New Year     and other Christian celebrations, it is haraam for the Muslim to hold such     celebrations or participate in them. This has been explained in fatwas no.    <a href=\"/en/answers/50074\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">50074</a> and <a href=\"/en/answers/175577\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">175577</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Therefore they are celebrations that are haraam because of their origins;     moreover, they are not free of evils in the way they are celebrated. If     something is haraam or involves prohibited actions, it is haraam to help     others with it, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of     the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue,     righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and     transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”</p>\n<p>    [al-Maa’idah 5:2].</p>\n<p>    With regard to Christian wedding parties, they are not haraam because of     their origins per se, but they will never be free of prohibited matters such     as free mixing, wanton display, singing, music and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So     they come under the same rulings as the parties mentioned above. Therefore     it is not allowed to take part in them, because what is required of the     Muslim is to denounce these evils and not participate in them or approve of     them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It     was narrated that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah     (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:     “Whoever among you sees an evil action,     then let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then     with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart –     and that is the weakest of faith.”</p>\n<p>    Narrated by Muslim (78).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the    truth when he said, I am not leaving behind any fitnah (trial, temptation) more    harmful to men than women. </p>\n<p>(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4706).    </p>\n<p>He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also    said: This world is sweet and dazzling, and Allaah has you put in charge of it to    see how you will do and what you will do, so beware of this world and beware of women, for    the first fitnah (temptation, trial) that befell the Children of Israel was concerning    women. </p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim, 4925).    </p>\n<p>You have to deal with two things, one now and one in the    future. As far as your past misbehaviour is concerned, you must repent sincerely to Allaah    right now, and do good deeds to expiate for your bad deeds, as was reported in the hadeeth    of Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that a man kissed a woman    [who was unlawful for him]; he came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be    upon him) and told him about it, [saying, I met a woman in the garden, and I    embraced her, touched her and kissed her]. [Here I am, judge concerning me as you    wish.] [He started asking how he could expiate for this, and (the Prophet     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) did not say anything]. Then Allaah revealed    the words (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends    of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil    deeds [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, O Messenger of Allaah, is this    just for me? He said, It is for all of my ummah </p>\n<p>(reported by    al-Bukhaari, 495; additional material in brackets is from the reports of al-Tirmidhi,    Ahmad, Muslim and Ibn Maajah, in that order), so do a lot of acts of    worship and good deeds, so that Allaah may accept your repentance.     </p>\n<p>As far as the future is concerned, you are not permitted at all to go    to places where there is corruption and free mixing, where you are likely to meet women.    You say that you cannot control yourself, so why do you go to places where you spend time    chatting informally with women, and then say that you cannot resist? What you say is    completely unacceptable. If you avoid the places and things that lead to evil, and do not    expose yourself to it, you will protect yourself from falling into sin. Fear Allaah, for    Allaah is watching you to see how you will do and what you will do. Beware of going to    places that will lead you into haraam things. Remember that the more you indulge in haraam    activities, the more difficult it is to retreat, so nip it in the bud. Stick to righteous    company, and keep away from evil things and evil people. Do everything that will help you    to remain chaste, such as hastening to marry and lowering your gaze. I ask Allaah to    protect you from the temptation of women. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>\n",

      "title": "He wants to marry her but she does not wear niqaab. Should he go ahead and propose or should he look for someone else?",
      "question": "<p>I am a young Arab man who lives according to our Arab traditions, or what is known as a good attitude and etiquette, but this commitment has nothing to do with adhering to Islamic teachings, because in our country adhering to tradition does not contradict listening to music, mixing, dealing with riba-based banks and so on. I proposed marriage to a girl in the same environment that I am living in, and her family have been friends of my family for a long time. They all approved of the marriage since they know that we are both of good character. But my problem, unfortunately, started when I began to read about the rules on marriage in Islam and I started to reduce mixing and to pray regularly in the mosque and let my beard grow and not deal with riba-based banks and not listen to music and so on. Now both families are regarding me as an extremist, except those on whom Allaah has mercy, and they started to make this girl afraid of me, even though she loves me very much and has told them all about that many times. The girl wants to be committed but she is not able to do some things such as wearing niqaab or covering the face. So she too regards these things as signs of extremism in religion, as her family do. <br />\nShould I forget about this girl who is of good character and proper etiquette and who is keen to pray and recite the adhkaar of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is trying to be committed, and who loves me and tells others of that, and does not want to lose me, but she is unable to do some things that have to do with religion, such as covering her face, and look for someone else who is committed but whose family and behaviour I do not know and my judgement of her will be only according to what I hear from those who know her family and behaviour?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>We ask Allaah the Almighty to make us and you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to bless us and you with more obedience and righteousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what you are asking about, it is better for you to stay with this girl towards whom your heart is inclined, and who feels likewise about you, and who has no faults that would cause you to leave her. All that there is, is that she needs a little care and encouragement and sound Islamic education to accept and follow the commands of Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A lot of that may come after marriage, especially if you treat her nicely and move her into a better environment than the one she is in, which is what we advise and encourage you to do. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no reason why a woman who loves her religion and is obedient to her husband should not respond to the command of Allaah as regards her clothing, especially since this will make her husband love and respect her more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Her refusal to wear niqaab may be because of the lies fabricated by some of those who are ignorant and who follow their own whims and desires, who say that the niqaab is a custom inherited from the Jaahiliyyah and that it was not brought by Islam. You should explain to her the ruling on a woman covering her face, with evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and tell her that the scholars are unanimously agreed that this ruling is prescribed in Islam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remind her of the Sahaabi women who hastened to tear their aprons so that they could cover their faces after the verse of hijab was revealed, and encourage her to have righteous friends. Tell her that this world is transient and soon each of us will meet our Lord with our deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Neither you nor she should worry about what your families will say. As for such environments where the rulings of Islam are not known and people cannot differentiate between proper adherence to Islam and extremism no attention should be paid to them or to what they say about one who adheres to the path of righteousness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your wife does not respond to the Islamic injunction to cover the face, then be patient with her, and try to convey the message to her in some other way, such as from another women who is involved in da’wah, or by means of tapes and books by scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seek the help of Allaah and persist in calling upon Him, asking Him for support and help to establish a household based on what our Lord loves and is pleased with.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Show her the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21134\">21134</a>, which speaks of the obligation to wear niqaab according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And please see question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20343\">20343</a> which speaks of the husband’s duty to advise his wife and how he may do so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah is the Source of strength.</p>\n",

Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. I received your letter telling me that you are 23 years old and that you are a Shi’a and a follower of Dawood Bohra, and that the representative of the leader of that group [the Bohra Shi’a] in Kenya is not allowing the official licensed to perform marriages in Mombasa to do your marriage contract, and you want to know the Islamic ruling on that.</p>\n",

It is           known in Islamic sharee’ah that guardians are obliged to arrange the           marriages of girls under their care if someone compatible proposes marriage,           because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“And           marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and           the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious,           fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid servants (female           slaves).

And Allaah is All Sufficent for His creatures’ needs, All Knowing (about           the state of the people).”</p>\n<p>[al-Noor           24:32]</p>\n<p>And it was narrated that the Prophet                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to           you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased,           then marry [your female relative under your care] to him, for if you           do not do that then there will be fitnah (tribulation) on earth and           much mischief.” (Narrated by Imaam al-Tirmdihi and others).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Based           on that, then if one of your guardians who is related to you arranges           your married to a compatible person, the representative of the Bohra           group has no right to object to that, and the marriage will be valid,           so long as the conditions of marriage are fulfilled. That should be           done through the sharee’ah court in Mombasa so that no objections can           be raised by the representative of the Bohra group. If the marriage           is done in the manner mentioned, then your children will be legitimate           and neither the Bohra group nor anybody else will be able to deny that.           If your relatives refuse to marry you to one who is compatible in order           to please the representative of the Bohra group, then their guardianship           becomes invalid thereby, and the Muslim judge (qaadi) has the right           to do the marriage contract for you with the compatible person who has           proposed marriage to you, because the Prophet                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The ruler is the           wali for the one who has no wali.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The           qaadi is the deputy of the ruler and takes his place in such matters,           and if the wali (guardian) is refusing to arrange the girl’s marriage,           the ruling on him is the same as if he was not there at all. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;But           we advise you and others in your position to forsake the Bohra madhhab           and other Shi’a madhhabs, because they go against the Islamic way of           Muhammad                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in many ways. So you have           to leave them and join the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah who           follow that which is dictated by the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the way           of the early generations of this ummah, the Companions of the Messenger                     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who follow them           in truth. I ask Allaah to guide this group and other groups which have           gone astray from the right path, and to show them the path of truth.           May He help you and us and all the Muslims to do that which will lead           to salvation and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, for He           is the One Who is able to do that. Peace be upon you and the mercy and           blessings of Allaah.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I want to know if Prophet mohammed has seen the heaven?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Many texts indicate that Paradise and Hell are two creations which currently exist, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise and Hell. This is proven by many events, for example:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “There was an eclipse of the sun during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed… Then he said, ‘The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not become eclipsed because of the death of somebody or because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah.’ The people said, O Messenger of Allah, we saw you taking something from where you were standing, and then we saw you retreating.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ‘I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of its inhabitants were women.’ The people asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why is that?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ‘Because of their ungratefulness.’ It was asked, ‘Are they ungrateful to Allah?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘They are ungrateful to their life companions (husbands) and ungrateful for good deeds. If you are kind towards one of them throughout life, then she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, “I have never seen anything good from you.”’”</p>\n<p>(This version narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1052; also narrated by Muslim, 901)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise in his dreams, and the dreams of the Prophets are a form of wahy (revelation) and are true; he saw al-Rumaysa’ in Paradise; he saw a palace belonging to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab in Paradise; and he saw Paradise on the night of the Mi’raaj when the Sidrah (lote-tree of the utmost boundary) was covered with what it was covered with. And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
