      "title": "He suffers from compulsive waswaas and speaks words of kufr; does he have to do anything?",
      "question": "<p>My question is: I am a young girl of 19 years who has received a proposal. He was my senior in high school and unfortunately we had a short lived haram relationship of talking to each other unlawfully. We both repented and he wants to marry me. His father is an apostate suffering from Bipolar type 2 disorder and Obsessive compulsive disorder. I read that OCD patients suffer from religious obsessions about the devil. Is he accountable for his apostasy due to his mental illness? secondly, he wants to know how to deal with this situation in the correct way as well as the rest of the family. his mother still lives with his father. Due to his illness, the father also caused financial ruin (linked to bipolar 2). What are the rights of the family in this case and the rights of the father over them? He is extremely non compliant with treatment. Lastly, if i do marry him, what kind of relationship should I and our children have with his father?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Compulsive waswaas refers to thoughts and bad ideas that come one after another to a person’s mind even though he does not want them, in such a way that he cannot rid himself of them, even though he knows and is certain that they are foolish and unacceptable thoughts. They keep coming to his mind compulsively, which causes him a great deal of anguish and distress.</p>\n<p>The remedy for compulsive waswaas and other types of waswaas is to remember Allah a great deal, obey Him, and turn to Him, beseeching Him, and seeking refuge with Him; to overlook and ignore the waswaas, and not let oneself get carried away with it. In some cases there is a need to consult a doctor.</p>\n<p>See the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/39684\">39684</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/90819\">90819</a>.</p>\n<p>Allah will not punish a person or call him to account for this waswaas, because it is beyond his control and overwhelms him; it does not happen by his choice. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>\n<p>“Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.”</p>\n<p>[al-Talaaq 65:7]</p>\n<p>“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”</p>\n<p>[al-Taghaabun 64:16].</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6664; Muslim, 127.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Allah will not punish the one who suffers from compulsive waswaas, because He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear” [al-Baqarah 2:286] and “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. But the one who is suffering from waswaas has to frequently seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan and ignore it; if he does that, then it will depart from him by Allah’s leave. End quote.</p>\n<p>Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 24/2</p>\n<p>If this man speaks words of kufr (disbelief) and words that put him beyond the pale of Islam because of this compulsive waswaas, without being aware of what he is saying or understanding what it means, or he understands what it means but he did not intend to say it and did not say it voluntarily – rather he said it under the pressure of this waswaas which forced him to say it – then he will not be punished for it, because it is beyond his control. He comes under the same ruling as one who speaks words of kufr because he is forced to do so. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith but such as open their hearts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a great torment”</p>\n<p>[an-Nahl 16:106].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If he is forced to disbelieve and he disbelieves, but his heart is at rest with Faith, then he is not deemed to be a disbeliever, because there is an impediment to doing so, which is that he was forced. End quote.</p>\n<p>Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen, 3/54</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/229:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to describe as a disbeliever one who was forced to utter words of disbelief when his heart was at rest with Faith. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “…except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith …” [an-Nahl 16:106]. End quote.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/62839\">62839</a></p>\n<p>Based on that, this man is not to be deemed an apostate, unless he says or does something to indicate disbelief at the time when he is aware of what he is doing, and he says or does it voluntarily. In that case he would be deemed an apostate and would bear full responsibility for his words or deeds.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The family’s role towards this poor father may be summed up as follows:</p>\n<p>1.All the members of the family have to show patience towards him with regard to unpleasant things that happen with him, because that is happening without him intending it to.</p>\n<p>2.They should strive to find treatment for him and spend as much as they can on that, and use tricks to treat him. Many cases of waswaas are in fact cases of sickness that can be treated by psychologists and the like.</p>\n<p>3.They should offer a lot of supplication and beseech Allah to remove this harm and heal him.</p>\n<p>4.Ruqya as prescribed in Islam. His son, wife or any other family member or other person may perform ruqya for him as prescribed in Islam. Allah may heal types of chronic sickness by His grace, by means of Islamically prescribed ruqya from the Qur’an and Sunnah.</p>\n<p>See also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/3476\">3476</a></p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If this suitor is of good character and religiously committed, then there is nothing wrong with marrying him, whether his father is healthy or otherwise, and whether he is a Muslim or an apostate. None of those factors are an impediment to marrying his son, so long as the son is religiously committed and of good character.</p>\n<p>However we do not think that you should rush to accept such a person; rather proceeding with caution in the case of such proposals that may lead to complicated social problems is better, more sensible and wiser.</p>\n<p>You have to let your guardians know about the matter and they should find out the facts for themselves, so that they can make the right decision for their daughter.</p>\n<p>If you feel that this will have an impact on your life and your social relationships, then you are still young, so if you wait for a more suitable opportunity that is less likely to cause you problems, then perhaps that is better and more appropriate.</p>\n<p>If you insist on accepting this suitor, and your guardians agree to it, then you and your husband should have separate accommodation; that is more likely to avoid problems and keep you away from troubles.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he will be the grandfather of your children and also your father-in-law, the father of your husband, so you should strive hard to treat him kindly as much as you can.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/146463\">146463</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on tawarruq involving metals via al-Jazeera Bank",
      "question": "<p>We want Al-jazeera bank to finance us by using our property as a guarantee. They evaluate the property and give us 60 to 70% of its value. They finance is by selling metals. We are worried about this, but this is the only bank that accepted to finance us this way. Is this halal or no? They told us that this is a legal way Islamically. They explained that what they do is buying iron for many people and then they receive a permission of them for selling it. We asked for tawrruq involving shares but they said it is not possible to finance properties, and that a religious council supervises the tawarruq that involve metals.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If the bank is selling the iron to you, and you yourself are selling it in the market in order to acquire money, then this is tawarruq that is acceptable in sharee’ah. But if you are not selling it yourself, rather you are delegating the bank to sell it, then this is called tawarruq that is organized by the bank, and a resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Council has stated that it is haram. Academic research by a number of specialists has also shown that this transaction is haram. For a detailed discussion of that, please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98124\">98124</a>.</p>\n<p>Dr. Muhammad al-‘Usaymi (may Allaah preserve him) was asked about the ruling on financing involving metals with the al-Jazeera Bank.</p>\n<p>He replied: I do not think that tawarruq involving metals is permissible unless the customer actually takes possession of them, then sells them to someone other than the dealer from whom the bank bought them. If all of that is not done, then it is not permissible. End quote.</p>\n<p>The prescribed alternative is to purchase real goods from the bank, such as cars and so on, which the bank takes possession of and brings to its own location, then the bank sells them to you, and you go and sell them in the market after that in order to obtain cash.</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is the ruling on going ahead and doing something without asking about the ruling on it?",
      "question": "<p>Is the one who could have asked about the ruling on some action, but did not ask, regarded as if proof was established against him? For example, if he is not sure whether doing something is a sin or not, then he decided not to ask about the ruling on it, is there any sin on him if he goes ahead and does that thing, when that thing is a sin? If possible, please refer to scholarly views on this issue, and say which you think is most likely to be correct, if there is no consensus on the matter.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>What the Muslim must do is learn before he acts. So it is not permissible for him to go ahead and do something when he does not know the ruling on it. That becomes more important if he is not sure whether that thing is a sin or not.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned}&nbsp;[al-Isra’ 17:36].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>In this verse, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, forbids pursuing that of which one has no knowledge… That includes speaking without knowledge, or doing some actions about which one has no knowledge. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, refers to this meaning in other verses.\"(<em>Adwa’ al-Bayan</em>&nbsp; 3/682).</p>\n<p>Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his <em>Sahih</em>:</p>\n<p>Chapter: Learning before speaking or acting, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So know, [O Muhammad], that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah} [Muhammad 47:19]; thus He began with knowledge.</p>\n<p>The scholars are the heirs of the prophets, who left behind a legacy of knowledge. Whoever acquires that knowledge has taken an abundant share, and whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge}&nbsp;[Fatir 35:28]</p>\n<p>{But none will understand them except those of knowledge}&nbsp;[al-‘Ankabut 29:43]</p>\n<p>{And they will say, “If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze”}&nbsp;[al-Mulk 67:10]</p>\n<p>{Are those who know equal to those who do not know?}&nbsp;[az-Zumar 39:9].</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He grants him understanding of religion” and “Knowledge is only acquired through learning.” Abu Dharr said: If you put this sword on here – and he pointed to the back of his neck – then I thought that I could convey a word I heard from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before you kill me, I would convey it.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abbas said: Be pious scholars of the Lord, possessed of forbearing and understanding. It was said that the pious scholar [<em>rabbani</em>] is the one who starts by teaching people easy issues of knowledge before difficult issues.</p>\n<p>Ibn Majah narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.”</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Ishaq ibn Rahawayh said: Seeking knowledge is obligatory, although there is no soundly-narrated report which says that. But what is meant is that the individual must seek the knowledge of how to do what he needs to do, such as wudu’ and prayer, zakah if he has wealth, and also Hajj and so on…</p>\n<p>Abu ‘Umar said: Ishaq meant – and Allah knows best – that regarding the hadith about the obligation to seek knowledge, there are some reservations among the scholars of hadith about its isnad, but its meaning is correct in their view…</p>\n<p>Then he narrated with his isnad from ‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq that the latter said: I said to Ibn al-Mubarak: What is the thing that the believer cannot do unless he seeks knowledge about it? And what must he learn? He said: He cannot take any action except on the basis of knowledge, and he cannot acquire knowledge unless he asks.\"(<em>Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi</em>&nbsp; 1/52-56).</p>\n<p>This is a matter on which the scholars are agreed.</p>\n<p>Al-Qarafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Al-Ghazali narrated in <em>Ihya’ ‘Ulum ad-Din</em> that there was consensus on that. Ash-Shafa‘i also narrated in <em>ar-Risalah</em> that it is not permissible for the accountable person to take any action until he knows the ruling of Allah concerning it. So the one who becomes involved in buying and selling must learn the rulings and guidelines that Allah has prescribed with regard to buying and selling. The one who gets involved in renting and hiring must learn what Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to renting and hiring. The one who wants to lend or borrow money must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed with regard to lending and borrowing. The one who wants to offer a particular prayer must learn the rulings that Allah, may He be exalted, has prescribed for that prayer. The same applies to purification and all other words and deeds.\"(A<em>l-Furuq&nbsp;</em>2/275).</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhari (2964) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said:</p>\n<p>… One of you will be fine so long as he fears Allah. If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Mulaqqin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Regarding his words “If he has any doubt about something, he should ask a man who will give him an answer,” what he means is that part of fearing Allah is not doing anything that you are unsure of until you ask someone who has knowledge about that, so that he can give you an answer regarding it.\"(A<em>t-Tawdih</em>&nbsp; 18/81).</p>\n<p>Ash-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one who follows a scholar is faced with some religious issue, he has no option but to ask about it, and that is the general ruling, because Allah did not ask the people to worship Him on the basis of ignorance; rather He asked them to worship Him on the basis of the verse in which He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you} [al-Baqarah 2:282]. It is not in the way in which many people interpret this verse; rather, according to the understanding of leading scholars of Arabic language, it means: Allah will teach you about whatever issue you are faced with, so fear Him. It is as if the second thing mentioned (teaching) will lead to the first thing mentioned (taqwa or fear of Allah). So the issue of taqwa (fear of Allah) is connected to the condition, which is that you should acquire knowledge. This means that knowledge comes before actions. There is a great deal of evidence to support this meaning, and this is a matter concerning which there is no dispute among the scholars, so there is no need to discuss it at length.\"(A<em>l-Muwafaqat</em>&nbsp; 5/283).</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If someone is required to ask and learn, but he fails to ask about what he is not sure of with regard to his religion by way of negligence, laziness and following whims and desires, then he is undoubtedly being heedless about his religion and exposing himself to punishment.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The one who is able to ask, seek guidance and learn about the truth, but he fails to do that because he is preoccupied with worldly matters, pursuit of leadership, seeking pleasure, making money and so on, is heedless and deserves the punishment, and he is sinning by neglecting what is required of him, which is fearing Allah as much as he can. The ruling in his case is the same ruling as that on others like him who neglect some obligatory duties.\"(A<em>t-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah</em>&nbsp; 1/465).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>What is required of the individual is not to delay asking people of knowledge, because the more he delays asking, the more he will increase in sin, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{So [O people] ask those who have knowledge, if you do not know}&nbsp;[an-Nahl 16:43].</p>\n<p>So what the individual must do is ask first, before taking action. If it so happens that he acts, then becomes uncertain, then he must hasten to ask.\"(<em>Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb&nbsp;</em>8/315).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He prayed behind an apostate imam for five years and was aware of his apostasy",
      "question": "<p>I prayed for a number of years in a mosque behind an imam who used to revile Allah, may He be exalted, and I used to advise the imam not to commit an act of kufr and revile Allah, but he did not listen to the advice. I prayed behind that imam for nearly 5 years, after which I finally stopped praying behind the imam.<br />\nWhat must I do so that Allah will accept my repentance? Do I have to make up those prayers or not? What is the expiation for that?<br />\nPlease note: I was aware of the situation of the imam of the mosque, and that he was a follower of innovation that constitutes kufr. During that time I had the keys to the mosque and I used to open the door of the mosque for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted, so that the worshippers could pray. I did not check the ‘aqeedah of the imam of the mosque; rather it was his habit to revile Allah, may He be exalted, a great deal.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Whoever reviles Allah, may He be exalted, or His Book or any of His angels or Messengers is a disbeliever who is beyond the pale of Islam; it is not permissible to pray behind him because the ummah is unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to pray behind a disbeliever, whether he was originally a disbeliever or is an apostate. The one who prays behind him when he is aware of his situation has to repeat the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The disbeliever cannot be an imam under any circumstances, whereas the believer may be an imam in all circumstances, except that he should not pray unless he is in a state of purity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a man is a Muslim and he apostatises, then he leads the prayer whilst he is an apostate, the prayer of those who prayed behind him is not acceptable unless he openly expresses his repentance verbally before leading them in prayer. If he openly expresses his repentance verbally before leading them in prayer, then it is acceptable for them to pray with him.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Umm (1/195)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ash-Shiraazi said in al-Muhadhdhab (1/183):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not valid for a disbeliever to lead the prayer, because he is not one of those who are obliged to pray; if he goes forward and leads people in prayer, he is not regarded as having become Muslim, because that is one of the minor issues of faith, so he does not become Muslim by doing that. The same ruling applies if he were to fast Ramadan or give zakaah on his wealth. As for the one who prays behind him, if he is aware of his situation, then his prayer is not valid, because he connected his prayer to a prayer that is invalid…. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not valid to pray behind a disbeliever under any circumstances, whether one becomes aware of his being a disbeliever after finishing the prayer or before that. The one who prayed behind him has to repeat his prayer. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i and ashaab ar-ra’y. Abu Thawr and al-Muzani said: The one who prayed behind him and was not aware of the situation does not have to repeat his prayer, because he followed the prayer of one whose situation he was unaware of, so his case is like that of one who followed in prayer a person who is in a state of minor impurity.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Mughni (2/16)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not valid to pray behind a disbeliever in any situation, whether his disbelief is in terms of beliefs, words, actions or things that he fails to do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of belief e.g., if he believes that there is another god besides Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of words e.g., if he ridicules Allah or His Messenger or His religion. Whoever ridicules Allah or His Messenger or His religion is a disbeliever, even if he prays. … We know that no Muslim can pray behind a disbeliever, but if we assume that someone prayed behind a man and was not aware that he was a disbeliever until after the prayer was over, does he have to repeat the prayer or not?</p>\n<p>The answer is that some of the scholars said that he does not have to repeat the prayer, because he is excused.</p>\n<p>And some scholars said that he does have to repeat the prayer, because one of the conditions of leading the prayer being valid is that the imam should be a Muslim.</p>\n<p>If someone were to say: can we differentiate and say that if the signs of disbelief are obvious in his case, then the prayer is not valid, and there is no excuse for ignorance because there is circumstantial evidence, otherwise the prayer is not invalid?</p>\n<p>Our answer is: that may be the case. The more correct scholarly view concerning this issue is that if he is unaware (of the imam being an apostate), then his prayer is valid.</p>\n<p>End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (4/220).</p>\n<p>Based on that, the prayers that you offered behind that evildoer imam are not valid on his part, primarily because of his being an apostate, or on your part, because your prayer was connected to the prayer of an apostate. So you have to repeat all of these prayers, and strive hard to work out how many they are, until you think it most likely that you have done what you have to do. This is the view of the majority of scholars.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/439):</p>\n<p>If the number of missed prayers is great, he should try hard to make them up, unless that will cause him physical or financial hardship. As for physical hardship, that is when he may get too tired or may fear sickness. As for financial hardship, that is when it could lead to him becoming unable to dispose of his wealth (and run his business), to the point that it keeps him away from earning a living, or he may be harmed by that. Ahmad stated something to this effect. If he does not know how many prayers he owes, he should keep making them up until he is certain that he has made up all that he missed. Ahmad said, according to the report of Saalih, concerning a man who had missed prayers: he should keep making them up until he is sure that he has made up all that he missed. End quote.</p>\n<p>End quote.</p>\n<p>This case is not like that of one who is committing an innovation that could put him beyond the pale of Islam, because he may be excused by some as he is basing his innovation on some sort of ijtihaad or misinterpretation or the like, and even if he is to be regarded as a disbeliever, his disbelief is not like that of one who has the audacity to revile Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. So how about if he combines these two evil deeds? How could such a person pray to the Lord of the Worlds, let alone become an imam?!</p>\n<p>Please see also the answers to questions no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20885\" target=\"_blank\">20885</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/129407\" target=\"_blank\">129407</a></p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>Why has Allah appointed certain angels to do tasks when he (s.w.t) can do it himself? Asking out of curiosity</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>One of the basic principles of faith is belief in the noble angels, and belief that Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed each angel to do a certain task. That includes managing some matters of this universe. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And those who arrange [each] matter}&nbsp;[Az-Nazi`at 79:5].</p>\n<p>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Regarding the words {And those who arrange [each] matter}, `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata’, Abu Salih, al-Hasan, Qatadah, ar-Rabi` ibn Anas and as-Suddi said: This refers to the angels.

(End quote from <em>Tafsir as-Sa‘di</em>, p. 908).</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Every movement in the heavens and on earth, including the movement of planets, stars, the sun, the moon, winds, clouds, plants and animals, is initiated by the angels who are appointed in charge of the heavens and the earth, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who arrange [each] matter} [az-Nazi`at 79:5] and {And the [angels] apportioning [each] matter} [adh-Dhariyat 51:4]. These verses refer to the angels, according to those who believe and follow the messengers (peace be upon them)…</p>\n<p>The Qur’an and Sunnah indicate that there are different types of angels, and that they are appointed in charge of different types of created things. Allah, may He be glorified, has appointed angels in charge of the mountains, and has appointed angels in charge of the clouds and rain. He has appointed angels in charge of the wombs, who manage the affairs of the fertilised egg until its creation is completed, then He appoints angels to protect the person, and angels to record his deeds and write them down. He has appointed angels in charge of death, and has appointed angels to question the deceased in the grave. He has appointed angels in charge of heavenly bodies, who control their movements, And He has appointed angels in charge of the sun and moon. He has appointed angels in charge of hell to stoke its flames and punish its occupants, and He has appointed angels in charge of what happens in it. He has appointed angels in charge of paradise and what happens in it, who take care of its plants and rivers.The angels are the greatest of the troops of Allah, may He be exalted. (End quote from <em>Ighathat al-Lahfan</em>, 2/842)</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>Even though Allah, may He be exalted, has appointed the angels to manage some matters of His dominion, their management thereof is by His leave and His command, and they only do what they are commanded to do.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The word <em>malak</em> (angel) conveys the sense of a messenger who is carrying out the command of someone else. So the angels have no say in anything; rather the command belongs to Allah, the One, the Compeller, alone, and they carry out His command.</p>\n<p>{They do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.</p>\n<p>He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him}&nbsp;[Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28]</p>\n<p>{They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded}&nbsp;[An-Nahl 16:50]</p>\n<p>{they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded}&nbsp;[At-Tahrim 66:6].</p>\n<p>They only descend by His command, and they do not do anything except after He has given permission. They are honoured slaves of His. Some of them are the [angels] lined up in rows and some of them are those who glorify Him. There is no one among them but he has an assigned place, beyond which he does not go, and he does the task that he was commanded to do, without falling short or overstepping the mark. (End quote from <em>Ighathat al-Lahfan</em>, 2/843).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>One of the things that are definitively proven in Islam is that Allah, may He be exalted, does not do anything except on the basis of ultimate wisdom, whether He has informed us of that or has kept knowledge of it to Himself, may He be glorified and exalted.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of the jinn and humankind, and he (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:</p>\n<p>Before I speak about this matter, I would like to point out a general principle regarding what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates and what He prescribes.</p>\n<p>This principle is taken from the verses (interpretation of the meaning)</p>\n<p>{and He is the Knowing, the Wise} [at-Tahrim 66:2] and {Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise} [an-Nisa’ 4:11], and many other verses which affirm that Allah is wise in what He creates and in what He prescribes – that is, in His universal decree and His religious decree. There is nothing that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, creates but there is wisdom behind it, whether that is when bringing it into existence or when taking it out of existence.</p>\n<p>And there is nothing that Allah, may He be exalted, prescribes except there is wisdom behind it, whether that is making something obligatory or prohibited or permissible.</p>\n<p>But this wisdom on which His universal decree and religious decree are based may be known to us or it may be unknown, or it may be known to some people and not others, commensurate with the level of knowledge and understanding that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, grants them. (End quote from <em>Majmu` Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin</em>, 1/87).</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The perfect nature of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, is something that is well established and well known to every Muslim, and submitting to it is one of the fundamentals of faith.</p>\n<p>Imam ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah enjoined His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all other creatures to worship Him in whatever way He willed, as was stated by His Prophet. No one has the right to question why or how, or add his own view to what was narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). (End quote from <em>al-Umm</em>, 10/16).</p>\n<p>Knowing that motivates the Muslim to focus on purifying himself and not let himself be distracted by giving his view on issues that do not bring any benefit; rather they lead to going to extremes in doubts and expose him to intrusive thoughts (waswasah).</p>\n<p>Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>You should understand that the basis of servitude and belief in Allah and His Books and His Messengers is submission and not asking about the details of the wisdom behind the commands, prohibitions and other divine laws.</p>\n<p>Hence Allah, may He be glorified, did not tell us that any nation that believed in its prophet and believed in the message he brought to them ever asked him about the details of the wisdom behind what he enjoined them to do and forbade them to do, and what he conveyed to them from their Lord. If they had done that, they would not have been believers in their prophet; rather they accepted the teachings, submitted and surrendered.</p>\n<p>Whatever they learned of the wisdom behind rulings is what they learned, and whatever was hidden from them, their submission and surrender did not depend on knowing that, and the nation never thought that finding out about that wisdom was any of their concern, for they thought too highly of their messenger to ask him about that.</p>\n<p>Hence the early generations of this ummah – which is the most perfect of nations in terms of mature thinking, knowledge and understanding – did not ask their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Why did Allah enjoin such and such? Why did He forbid such and such? Why did He decree such and such? That was because they knew that asking such questions is contrary to faith and submission, and they could not remain steadfast in their commitment to Islam unless they surrendered…</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is not to be questioned about what He does, because of the perfect nature of His wisdom, mercy and justice, not merely because of His might and power. (End quote from <em>Sharh at-Tahhawiyyah</em>, p. 261-262)</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him} [al-Qasas 28:68].</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/186418/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">186418</a>.</p>\n<p>Fifthly:</p>\n<p>When the Muslim reflects on the actions of the angels, some aspects of the wisdom of Allah, may He be exalted, will become apparent to him.</p>\n<p>Allah’s creation of the angels and their deeds confirms the perfection of His lordship and His divinity. So when the Muslim learns about the immense size of these angels and their large numbers, and the tasks to which they are appointed, yet despite that not one of them disobeys Allah’s command in the slightest – rather they race to obey Him, may He be glorified and exalted – that is indicative of the perfect lordship and divinity of Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>If the great number of troops and workers of a king in this world is indicative of his perfect sovereignty and control, and is indicative of the high level of obedience that his subjects show him, then in the case of Allah, may He be exalted, this meaning is demonstrated more clearly by His creation of the noble angels. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{And they say, “The Most Merciful has taken a son.” Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.</p>\n<p>They do not speak until He has spoken, and they act by His command.</p>\n<p>He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him.</p>\n<p>And whoever of them should say, “Indeed, I am a god besides Him” - that one We would requite with Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers}&nbsp;[Al-Anbiya’ 21:26-29].</p>\n<p>Moreover, for the one who studies the texts of the revelation concerning the existence of the angels and the tasks to which they are appointed, that will instil in him perfect fear of Allah, may He be exalted, and at the same time will instil in him perfect love and hope.</p>\n<p>If he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of punishment and those who write down people’s deeds, that will increase him in fear of Allah. In contrast, if he studies the texts of the revelation that speak of the angels of mercy and the guardian angels, that will increase him in love for his Lord and hope of His forgiveness. All of this leads to attaining the level of faith that is enjoined upon people.</p>\n<p>Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>{Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.</p>\n<p>They arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend}&nbsp;[As-Sajdah 32:15-16].</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Belief in the angels leads to great outcomes, including the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Knowledge of Allah’s greatness, power, might and authority, for the greatness of the created being is connected to the greatness of the Creator.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Gratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, for His care towards the children of Adam, as He has appointed some of these angels to protect them, record their deeds and do other things that are in their interests… (End quote from <em>Majmu` al-Fatawa</em>, 6/89).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the wisdom behind the creation of the noble scribes (the recording angels), even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows all things and nothing that we do in secret or in public is hidden from Him:</p>\n<p>The wisdom behind that is that it highlights the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has created all things in a system, according to estimates and calculations, and He has perfected it to the extent that He has appointed noble scribes to record the words and deeds of the children of Adam, who write down everything that they do, even though Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows what they will do before they do it.</p>\n<p>But all of that serves to highlight how perfect is the care of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for man, and it highlights the fact that this universe is put together in the best order and is perfectly designed.

Should she observe ‘iddah in the house of her family where she lives? Or does she have to move to her husband’s house? Please note that she has not lived there before, and her husband’s family have offered to let her spend the ‘iddah period with them with no reservations.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>A woman whose husband dies after doing the marriage contract with her and before consummating the marriage comes under the same rulings as any other wife. Therefore she is entitled to the mahr in full and is entitled to inheritance, and she must observe the ‘iddah, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued a ruling to that effect. It was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was asked about a man who married a woman, and did not specify a mahr for her or consummate the marriage with her before he died. He said: She is entitled to a mahr like that of her peers, no more and no less; she must observe ‘iddah; and she is entitled to inheritance. Ma‘qil ibn Sinaan al-Ashja‘i stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued a ruling concerning Birwa‘ bint Waashiq, one of our womenfolk, similar to the ruling that you have issued.

      "title": "The wisdom behind deeds being shown to Allah repeatedly, daily, weekly and annually",
      "question": "<p>In one of your fatwas, no. 44021, it says that the showing of deeds (to Allah) is of three types: 1- daily 2- weekly and 3- annually (which is in Sha‘baan). But I am confused: if there is a daily showing throughout the year, then there is no need for the weekly showing which includes the daily showing, and there is also no need for the annual showing which includes both of them. Is this correct?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The taking up of deeds and showing them to     Allah, may He be exalted, daily, weekly and annually is indicated by the     saheeh Sunnah and the words of the scholars, as explained previously in the     answer to question <a href=\"/en/answers/44021\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">44021</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As that is the case, it is not permissible     for anyone to question why Allah does something, or to think that anything     narrated in a sound text is contrary to wisdom, because that will result in     confusion and doubts. Rather what is required is to say as the believers     before him said: We hear and we obey. The one to whom ignorance and lack of     understanding and wisdom could be attributed is the human being and his     understanding and reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, you could add to this question and     say: what need is there for showing deeds to Allah in the first place, when     Allah, may He be exalted, is already aware of everything that people do?     What need is there for the angels to write down people’s deeds, when Allah     has already decreed all that is to happen until the Day of Resurrection,     before He created the heavens and the earth?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The questions that could be added in this     context are many, to such an extent that it would become too difficult for     the individual to close the door to whispers from the Shaytaan after he has     opened it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    But as the question was about the wisdom     behind showing deeds to Allah, may He be exalted, every day, then every     week, then every year, according to what is proven in the Sunnah, the answer     is that Allah knows best about the wisdom behind that, and He has not     explained it to us, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon     him) has not explained it to us&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in al-‘Aqeedah at-Tahhaawiyyah wa     Sharhuha (1/231):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the words “The foot of Islam     cannot be steadfast except on the basis of acceptance without questioning     and of surrendering”:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This is a metaphor; the physical foot cannot     be steadfast except on some surface. What is meant is that commitment to     Islam cannot be steadfast unless the individual accepts the texts of the     Qur’an and Sunnah and submits to them, without questioning them or opposing     them on the basis of his opinion, rational thinking and analogy. Al-Bukhaari     narrated that Imam Muhammad ibn Shihaab az-Zuhri (may Allah have mercy on     him) said: Allah sends the message and the Messenger conveys it; our role is     to accept and submit. This is a comprehensive and beneficial statement. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Abu’l-Muzaffar as-Sam‘aani (may Allah     have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It should be noted that the criterion that     separates us from everyone who differs from us is the fact that we make the     foundation of our way the Qur’an and Sunnah, and we derive what we derive     from them (of rulings and teachings); anything else we work out within that     framework. We do not think that we should have authority over the principles     of sharee‘ah and alter the rules of Islam so that they become in harmony     with our views, thoughts and ideas. Rather we examine ideas and if we find     them to be in harmony with the fundamentals of Islam as stated in the Qur’an     and Sunnah, we accept them and praise Allah for that. But if we find     ourselves drifting away from the way of the Sunnah and we find ourselves     becoming confused and lost, then we point the finger of suspicion at our own     thinking and ideas; we blame ourselves and admit our helplessness, and we     rein in our reason so that it will not lead us to doom and destruction, or     cause us to drift away from the right path. We surrender to the Qur’an and     Sunnah, and let them lead us. We err on the side of caution and realise that     the words of our predecessors are true: Islam is a bridge that cannot be     crossed except by means of surrendering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    End quote from Qawaati‘ al-Adillah fi     Usool al-Fiqh, 2/411&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I have a friend who is a convert and lives with her non-muslim family، she will be having a baby soon and is no longer with the father of the child (father is a muslim)، they were not married and he lives in another country. Will the sister have to do the aqiqah for the baby (she is not familiar with the whole aqiqah process) and will she have to read the azan into the baby’s ears after birth?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>The ‘aqeeqah is Sunnah and mustahabb, but it is not obligatory. The one who follows this Sunnah will attain the reward and virtue, and the one who does not follow it will be falling short but he does not incur sin. This is the view of the majority of scholars, as has been explained previously in the answers to questions no.&nbsp; <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/20018\">20018</a> and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/38197\">38197</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The basic principle is that it is prescribed for the ‘aqeeqah to be done from the wealth of the father of the child, not from the wealth of the mother or the wealth of the child himself, because it is the father who is primarily addressed in the hadeeths which say that ‘aqeeqah is prescribed.</p>\n<p>But the fuqaha’ said: It is permissible for someone other than the father to offer the ‘aqeeqah on behalf of the child in the following cases:</p>\n<p>1.If the father falls short and refuses to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah</p>\n<p>2.If permission has been sought from the father to offer the ‘aqeeqah on his behalf and the father has given permission.</p>\n<p>They quoted as evidence for that the proven report from Ibn ‘Abbaas who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered ‘aqeeqah on behalf of al-Hasan and al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them), two rams for each. Narrated by al-Nasaa’i (no. 4219) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.</p>\n<p>They said: The fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered the ‘aqeeqah on behalf of his grandsons al-Hasan and al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them) indicates that it is permissible for the ‘aqeeqah to be done by someone other than the father if it is done with his permission and his consent.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadeeth, “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah, so (the sheep) is to be slaughtered for him on the seventh day, and his headis to be shaved, and he is to be given his name” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 3838; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood):</p>\n<p>The fact that the verb slaughter appears in the passive form that the one who offers the ‘aqeeqah is not specified. According to the Shafaa‘is, it is the duty of the one who is obliged to spend on the child. According to the Hanbalis, it is the duty of the father unless he is unable to do that because he is deceased or he refuses to do it.</p>\n<p>Al-Raafa‘i said: In this hadeeth it is as if there may have been a reason why Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered ‘aqeeqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn.</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi said: It may be understood as meaning that at that time his parents were poor or he volunteered to do it with the father's permission. Or it may be that he issued instructions that this be done, or it may be one of the things that are unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), just as he offered the udhiyah on behalf of those of his ummah who had not offered the sacrifice. Some of them regarded it as one of the things that were unique to him. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 9/596</p>\n<p>To sum up:</p>\n<p>It is not obligatory for the mother to offer the ‘aqeeqah on behalf of the newborn; rather it is mustahabb for her to do that if the father refuses to do it or if the father is unable to offer the sacrifice because he is far away or he is unaware of the birth and so on, and Allah will record the reward for her.</p>\n<p>Please see also the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/71161\">71161</a></p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>With regard to reciting the adhaan in the ear of the newborn, there is no saheeh hadeeth concerning that. Some of the fuqaha’ said that it is mustahabb.</p>\n<p>Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that this action is not mustahabb.</p>\n<p>If we say that it is prescribed to recite the adhaan in the ear of the newborn, as is the view of the Shaafa’is and others, the more correct of the two opinions – in sha Allah – is that it is permissible for a woman, whether it is his mother or another Muslim woman, to do that. This is different from the opinion of those scholars who stipulated that this should be done by a man, as is the case with regard to the adhaan for prayer.</p>\n<p>Al-Shabramalsi al-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words “it is Sunnah to recite the adhaan” mean even if it is done by a woman, because this is not the adhaan that is to be done by men; rather the aim here is simply to mention the name of Allah and seek blessing.</p>\n<p>End quote from his commentary (haashiyah) on Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 8/149.</p>\n<p>This is what it says in Haashyat al-Shuburi ‘ala al-Manhaj, that it is not essential that the person who recites the adhaan in the ear of the newborn should be male. This is supported by the view of some shaykhs, that this Sunnah is fulfilled by the midwife reciting the adhaan in the ear of the newborn.</p>\n<p>End quote from Haashiyat al-Tablaawi ‘ala Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 1/461</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Meaning of the hadith “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him”",
      "question": "<p>What is the meaning of one phrase from this hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will make him feel content with his lot and grant him peace of mind, and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people). Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him”? My question is: what is meant by the words “and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him”? If the hereafter is his main concern, will more of this world be decreed for him, and will this increase be part of what Allah had decreed and foreordained for him? We hope that you can clarify what is meant by this sentence.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2465) from Anas ibn Maalik, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will make him feel content with his lot and grant him peace of mind, and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people). Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will make him fear poverty constantly and confound his affairs, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him.”</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by Ibn Maajah (4105) from Zayd ibn Thaabit, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is focused only on this world, Allah will confound his affairs and make him fear poverty constantly, and he will not get anything of this world except that which has been written for him. Whoever is focused on the Hereafter, Allah will grant him peace of mind and make him feel content with his lot, and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (2/634).</p>\n<p>With regard to the words “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him” – in the second report, “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been written for him” – what is meant is that caring too much and being too eager for worldly gains will not increase a person in benefit, because his provision has already been decreed and written, so nothing will come to him except that which has been decreed and written for him, no matter how much he exerts himself for the sake of worldly gain. So the wise person must be content with seeking worldly provision in ways that are prescribed in Islamic teachings, without being eager for more.</p>\n<p>As-Sindi said in his commentary on Ibn Maajah:</p>\n<p>“and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people)” that is, in spite of circumstances and in spite of those who try to prevent it.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: what has been decreed for a person of provision will inevitably come to him, but if he is one who seeks the hereafter, it will come to him without undue exertion, but whoever seeks worldly gain, it come to him with exertion and hardship. So the one who seeks the hereafter will have both gains in this world and the hereafter. The goal of accumulating wealth is to find ease and comfort in this world, when this is attained by the one who seeks the hereafter, whereas the one who seeks worldly gain will lose out in this world and the hereafter, because in this world he exerts himself greatly in pursuit of worldly gain, so what benefit is there for him in wealth if he fails to attain comfort and ease?&nbsp; End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him” means whether he likes it or not, so he will get nothing of what he was seeking of extra worldly gains, despite his efforts and those of his companions.</p>\n<p>End quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (7/140).</p>\n<p>At-Teebi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The words “and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people)” are a counterpart to the words “he will not get anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him.”</p>\n<p>The meaning of the former [regarding the one whose aim is the hereafter] is that what has been decreed for him of worldly gains and provisions will come to him regardless (of circumstances, obstacles or people).</p>\n<p>The meaning of the latter [regarding the one whose aim is worldly gain] is that what has been decreed for him of worldly gains will come to him regardless of whether he likes it or not.</p>\n<p>End quote from Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (11/3372).</p>\n<p>This is clear from the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, fear Allah and be moderate in seeking a living, for no soul will die until it has received all its provision, even if it is slow in coming. So fear Allah and be moderate in seeking provision; take that which is permissible and leave that which is forbidden.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2144); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (6/209).</p>\n<p>What is meant by “be moderate in seeking a living” is: seek provision in a gentle manner, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained what is meant by that, which is to take that which is permissible and leave that which is forbidden.</p>\n<p>See: Fayd al-Qadeer (3/207).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best</p>\n",

      "title": "Are fatwas issued by women valid? Who are the women who were known for  knowledge and issuing fatwas in Islamic history?",
      "question": "<p>Is it valid for women to issue fatwas?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Allah, may He be exalted, sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, to be a bringer of glad tidings and a warner to all people. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fulfilled the trust and conveyed the message. Among those who heard him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were both women and men. So those who undertook the mission of conveying and teaching Islam were the Sahaabah and those who came after them; their students included both women and men, and the process of learning and teaching was done in accordance with Islamic guidelines, far removed from any haraam mixing, or women uncovering their faces, or speaking softly.</p>\n<p>Islam does not differentiate between men and women with regard to knowledge and issuing fatwas. The scholars have stipulated the conditions to be met by the mufti (scholar who issues fatwas), and they did not mention among these conditions that the mufti must be male. No difference of scholarly opinion is known concerning that.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The conditions to be met by the mufti are that he should be accountable, Muslim, trustworthy, honest, far removed from evildoing and from actions that could cast aspersions on his [or her] integrity, have an innate ability to grasp the meanings of things, be clear-minded and mature in thinking, of sound understanding and able to reach sound conclusions, and alert. This applies equally to one who is free, a slave, a woman, one who is blind, and one who is nonverbal, if he or she can write or his or her gestures can be understood. End quote.&nbsp;<em>Al-Majmoo‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab</em> (1/41).</p>\n<p>Among this great ummah there were women who undertook the duty of teaching and issuing fatwas, just as men did.</p>\n<p>Yes, the number of women cannot be compared to that of men, because of the nature of man, but this does not mean that there were not women who undertook the mission of teaching and issuing fatwas. Foremost among those women was the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Both men and women would seek her out to ask for fatwas, because she had been so close to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and because of her intelligence and smartness.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in <em>al-Isti‘aab</em> (p. 609):</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Masrooq said: I saw some of the elderly senior companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asking her about issues pertaining to the shares of inheritance.</p>\n<p>‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah said: ‘Aa’ishah was the most knowledgeable of the people and had the greatest understanding of religion.</p>\n<p>Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah said, narrating from his father: I never saw anyone who was more knowledgeable of fiqh, medicine or poetry than ‘Aa’ishah.</p>\n<p>Az-Zuhri said: If the knowledge of ‘Aa’ishah was compared to the knowledge of all the other wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the knowledge of all women put together, the knowledge of ‘Aa’ishah would surpass them all. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) listed those of the Sahaabah who issued many fatwas, among whom he mentioned ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). He listed Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) as one of those who issued a middling number of fatwas; and he listed Umm ‘Atiyyah, Safiyyah the Mother of the Believers, Hafsah and Umm Habeebah as being among those who issued a small number of fatwas.</p>\n<p>See: <em>I‘laam al-Muwaqqi‘een</em> (1/12, 13).</p>\n<p>We will list here some of the women whom Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) described as having knowledge and understanding of religion in his book <em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em>, in confirmation of what we have mentioned above.</p>\n<p>1.. Safiyyah bint Shaybah.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Safiyyah bint Shaybah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn Abi Talhah, the faqeehah and ‘aalimah (scholar).</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (3/507, 508).</p>\n<p>2.. Umm ad-Darda’.</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Umm ad-Darda’, the lady, the ‘aalimah, the faqeehah. She is Umm ad-Darda’ as-Sughra (the Younger).</p>\n<p>She narrated a great deal of knowledge from her husband Abu’d-Darda’, and from Salmaan al-Faarisi, Ka‘b ibn ‘Aasim al-Ash‘ari, ‘Aa’ishah, Abu Hurayrah and a number of others.</p>\n<p>She recited the entire Qur’an to Abu’d-Darda’ when she was very young.</p>\n<p>She lived a long life, and was famous for her knowledge, good deeds and asceticism (<em>zuhd</em>).</p>\n<p>Mak-hool said: Umm ad-Darda’ was a faqeehah.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (4/277, 278).</p>\n<p>3.. Mu‘aadhah al-‘Adawiyyah (d. 83 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Mu‘aadhah bint ‘Abdillah. The lady, ‘aalimah, mother of as-Sahba’ al-‘Adawiyyah al-Basriyyah, devoted worshipper, wife of the leading example Silah ibn Ashyam.</p>\n<p>She narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, ‘Aa’ishah and Hishaam ibn ‘Aamir.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (4/508, 509).</p>\n<p>4.. Bint al-Mihaamili (d. 377 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The scholar, faqeehah, mufti, Amat al-Waahid bint al-Husayn ibn Ismaa‘eel.</p>\n<p>She was taught by her father and narrated from him, and also from Ismaa‘eel al-Warraaq and ‘Abd al-Ghaafir al-Homsi. She memorized the Qur’an and the fiqh of ash-Shaafa‘i. She was well versed in shares of inheritance, Arabic language, and other subjects.</p>\n<p>Al-Burqaani said: She used to issue fatwas with Abu ‘Ali ibn Abi Hurayrah.</p>\n<p>Someone else said: She was one of the most well versed of people in fiqh.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (15/264).</p>\n<p>5.. Kareemah bint Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Haatim Umm al-Kiraam al-Marzawiyyah (d. 463 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The shaykhah, ‘aalimah, woman of virtue, narrator of hadith, Umm al-Kiraam.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (18/233, 234).</p>\n<p>6.. ‘Aa’ishah bint Hasan bin Ibraaheem (d. 460 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The preacher, ‘aalimah, narrator of hadith, Umm al-Fath al-Asbahaaniyyah al-Warkaaniyyah.</p>\n<p>Ibn as-Sam‘aani said: I asked al-Haafiz Ismaa‘eel about her, and he said: A righteous woman, a scholar who exhorts the women.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (18/302).</p>\n<p>7. Faatimah ad-Daqqaaq (d. 480 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Faatimah bint al-Ustaadh az-Zaahid Abu ‘Ali, al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali ad-Daqqaaq, the shaykhah, devoted worshipper, ‘aalimah, Umm al-Baneen an-Naysabooriyyah, wife of al-Ustadh Abu’l-Qaasim al -Qushayri and mother of his children.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (18/479, 480).</p>\n<p>8. Bint Za‘bah (d. 532 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The shaykhah, ‘aalimah, reciter of Qur’an, righteous woman, long-lived, the famous hadith narrator of&nbsp; Naysaboor (Nishapur), Umm al-Khayr, Faatimah bint ‘Ali ibn Muzaffar ibn al-Hasan ibn Za‘bal ibn ‘Ijlaan al-Baghdaadi thumma an-Naysabooriyyah.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (19/625).</p>\n<p>9.. Faatimah bint al-Baghdaadi (d. 539 AH).</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The shaykhah, ‘aalimah, preacher, righteous woman, long-lived, the famous hadith narrator of Isfahan, Umm al-Baha’, Faatimah bint Muhammad ibn Abi Sa‘d Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali ibn al-Baghdaadi al-Asbahaani.</p>\n<p><em>Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’</em> (20/148).</p>\n<p>This is a list of virtuous women who were scholars and muftis. Islam does not prevent any person of knowledge, man or woman, from issuing fatwas and teaching people the religion of Allah, may He be exalted.</p>\n<p>We should point out that there is a difference between being a mufti and being a qaadi (judge). Issuing a fatwa is informing people of the sh ar ‘i ruling, and no one is to be prevented from doing that if he or she is qualified to do it. As for being a qaadi, the evidence of the religious texts, and the practice of the Muslim ummah, indicate that a woman cannot be appointed as a qaadi. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/71338\" target=\"_blank\">71338</a> .</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
