      "title": "Dealing with a company that sells gold by means of pyramid marketing",
      "question": "<p>A company sells gold in a way that if you buy gold for $800 from it, you will be a member in this company. If you bring six buyers and they buy from the company, you will be an affective member and you will have continuous profits from this company forever according to how much it makes. Is it permissible to join this company?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    It is not permissible to join companies that are based on     pyramid marketing, because this transaction involves gambling and consuming     people’s wealth unlawfully, and tricking and deceiving them by telling them     that they will make unbelievable profits, which are very rarely achieved by     those who join these companies. This has been discussed in detail in the     answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/40263\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">40263</a>,    <a href=\"/en/answers/42579\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">42579</a> and    <a href=\"/en/answers/45898\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">45898</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the company sells gold, and the gold does not reach     the purchaser until several days after the contract is done, and this is     another reservation about this company. When selling gold for cash, it is     stipulated that the gold and the money be handed over in the same sitting as     that in which the contract is drawn up, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver,     wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for     like, same for same, hand to hand. If any of these types are different, then     sell however you like, so long as it is hand to hand.”&nbsp; Narrated by Muslim     (2970) from the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased     with him). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Riyals, dollars and other kinds of currency come under the     same rulings as gold and silver, so it is not permissible to buy gold for     any kind of currency unless it is hand to hand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the subscriber is going to pay the price of the gold up     front, then the gold is going to be sent to him by mail, or via a shipping     company, then this means that it is not hand to hand, so this transaction is     haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Some of these companies offer the option of paying by     instalments, which is another reason why it is haraam, because it is not     permissible to sell gold by instalments, rather it must be sold hand to hand     as stated above.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Conclusion: It is not permissible to join companies that are     based on pyramid selling, because their dealings are based on gambling and     consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, and because they involve riba when     selling gold by instalments or when delaying handing over gold until after     the sitting in which the contract is done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Ruling on hunting birds during the sacred months or in the sanctuary (al-Haram)",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on hunting birds during the sacred months or in the sanctuary (al-haram)?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Hunting birds during the sacred months is permissible, because what is forbidden during the sacred months is only fighting. But many scholars, or most of the scholars, say that the prohibition on fighting during the sacred months has been abrogated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if the birds are inside the boundary of the sanctuary, then it is not permissible to hunt them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when he conquered Makkah: “Its game is not to be disturbed.” If it is forbidden to disturb the game, then killing is even more forbidden. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in a state of Ihraam [for Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage)]”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:95]</p>\n<p>“Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food — for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel, but forbidden is (the pursuit of) land game as long as you are in a state of Ihraam (for Hajj or ‘Umrah)”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa’idah 5:96].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a person is in ihraam or is within the boundaries of the sanctuary, then it is not permissible for him to hunt.

      "title": "Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can",
      "question": "<p>We are a group of friends who get together to talk about and discuss worldly and religious matters. In one of our gatherings a question was asked, as follows: Can a Muslim live a 100% Muslim life whilst continuing to live and interact with his society with all the good and bad things that that involves? What I mean is that if he wants to keep away from everything that Allaah has forbidden and enjoy everything that Allaah has permitted in His Holy Book, and follow the Sunnah of His chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in what he has permitted and keep away from that which he has forbidden?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Muslim is not infallible. Every son of Adam inevitably commits sin and the best of those who sin are those who continually repent, as it says in the hadeeth. But it is possible for the Muslim to live in an Islamic society and adhere to his religion as much as he can, following the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”</p>\n<p>[al-Taghaabun 64:16 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>\n<p>His religious commitment is not affected by some sins that he may commit without meaning to, or that he thinks are permissible according to his own ijtihaad and reasoning and the information that he has, or that he asked some scholars about and they gave him a fatwa concerning that but the fatwa was not in accordance with sharee’ah. To sum up, what the Muslim has to do is to keep his duty towards Allaah and fear Him as much as he can, to regard as forbidden that which Allaah has forbidden to him, and to strive to do that which Allaah has enjoined upon him. If he slips or stumbles then he must hasten to repent sincerely.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "title": "What to do with a Guide Dog when entering a Mosque",
      "question": "<p>Assalaam alaikum<br />\nI am desiring to embrace Islam, however I have a slight concern. I am legally<br />\nblind and use a guide dog for mobility purposes. I have been informed that I<br />\nhave no problems being a Muslim and having a guide dog due to my<br />\ndisability. However, I am concerned at the reaction that I get from other<br />\nMuslims when I approach an Islamic Center. I do not want to offend but<br />\nwithout the assistance of the guide dog I am unable to travel to a Masjid or<br />\nIslamic center alone. With who should I discuss this situation i.e., an Imam? I<br />\nsometimes feel I am at a \"stalemate\" . <br />\nThank you for your help.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.)</p>\n<p>To the dear noble inquirer:</p>\n<p>You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern over what you may face vis-à-vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is simple and much easier to deal with than you may think.</p>\n<p>You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable according to Islamic shari’ah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing.</p>\n<p>I can’t imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing.</p>\n<p>In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) [translation of the meaning]:</p>\n<p>\"Verily Allaah has said, ‘If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him for them Heaven.’ \" (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653)</p>\n<p>We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness.</p>\n",

      "title": "What is your opinion of a Jumu’ah khutbah that, along with the prayer, lasts ten minutes?",
      "question": "<p>What do you say about an imam whose khutbah, along with the prayer, takes only ten minutes? Yes, ten minutes! Is this Jumu’ah valid?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that keeping the Jumu’ah khutbah short is indicative of the khateeb’s understanding of Islam, as he can compile many meanings in a few words, and does not speak for so long that the people forget the first things he said by the time he reaches the end. This was the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his regular khutbahs; indeed this is what he enjoined, and it is the best way. Similarly his exhortations were few so that what he exhorted the people could be remembered. So his Jumu’ah khutbahs were short and the exhortations few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Waa’il said: ‘Ammaar addressed us and he spoke briefly but eloquently. When he came down (from the minbar), we said: O Abu’l-Yaqzaan, you spoke eloquently but briefly, would that you had made it longer. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (S) say: “A man’s lengthening his prayer and shortening his khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion), so make your prayers lengthy and your khutbahs brief, for there is charm in eloquent speech.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (869).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are many comments from the scholars to confirm this idea:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.</p>\n<p>Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>As for making the khutbah short, it is a Sunnah to be followed. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that and did it. According to the hadeeth of ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined making the khutbah short. And he used to give khutbahs with good words and few, and he disliked prattle and long-windedness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scholars disapprove of exhortations in which some is forgotten because of the length, and they like that in which the listener can focus on what is said and learns from it after memorizing it. That can only occur when the exhortation is brief.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Istidhkaar (2/363, 364).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to make the khutbah lengthy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Muhalla (5/60).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is better to keep the khutbah short, because there are two benefits of keeping the khutbah short:</p>\n<p>(i)The listeners do not get bored, because if the khutbah is lengthy – especially if the khateeb delivers it in a boring manner which does not move their hearts and does not motivate them – then the people will get bored and fed up.</p>\n<p>(ii)That makes the listener remember better, because if it is too long, the first part of it is lost by the time he reaches the end, but if it is short, then it is possible to remember it and learn from it. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man’s lengthening his prayer and shortening his khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion),” i.e., it is indicative of his understanding of religion and shows that he pays attention to people’s circumstances. But sometimes there is a need for a lengthy exhortation, and if a person speaks at length because the situation requires that, it does not mean that he is excluded from the description of being one who understands religion, because length and shortness are relative matters. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would sometimes give a khutbah by reciting Soorat Qaaf, and Soorat Qaaf, when recited slowly and carefully (tarteel) and pausing at every verse, takes a long time.</p>\n<p>Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni’ (5/65).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This keeping the khutbah short should not be done in such a way as to erode the khutbah altogether, so that the people do not benefit at all from the khutbah. They have not travelled long distances or come out of their homes merely to see the khateeb, or to hear the tone of his voice, rather they have come to attain some benefit by hearing his exhortation or an Islamic ruling and so on. Hence attention should be paid to moderation in this matter. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I was praying with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his prayer was moderate and his khutbah was moderate.</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (1433).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., it was somewhere between being very long or too short to be any benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sharh Muslim (6/159)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is mustahabb to keep the khutbah short, because of the hadeeth quoted above, and so that they do not get bored by it. Our companions said: Keeping it short should be done in moderation, and should not be taken to such extremes that (its benefit) is erased altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Majmoo’ (4/358)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But we cannot say that a khutbah that is very short does not count, when most of the scholars are of the view that if the khutbah contains the essential parts (lit. pillars) then it is valid. There is a great difference of opinion as to the definition of those essential parts. The correct view is that there is nothing that can be called the essential parts or pillars of the khutbah, and everything that may be called a khutbah, even if it is only a few words, is counted as such and is valid as a khutbah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh Ibn Sa’di, whose views we have mentioned in the answer to question no. 115854. In the answer referred to, Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) supported this view, but he pointed out that it should not be followed. Please see his words in that answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This khateeb whose khutbah and prayer together take ten minutes does not have deep understanding of Islam, rather he is ignorant, because understanding of the religion means keeping the khutbah short and making the prayer long, not effectively destroying them both! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let us read what the Khateeb of al-Masjid al-Haraam, Shaykh Sa’ood al-Shuraym, says concerning the length of the Jumu’ah khutbah and prayer, with approximate length of time:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Sa’ood al-Shuraym (may Allaah preserve him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to reach an approximate definition of what is meant by the prayer being long and the khutbah being short in modern terms, I say – and Allaah is the source of strength – &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you recite in Fajr prayer, for example, al-Jumu’ah and al-Munaafiqoon at a moderate speed, the prayer will take you no less than ten minutes, if not fifteen. I tried it and I found that to be the case. All of this applies if you recite at a moderate speed, with the rukoo’ (bowing) and sujood (prostration) of the prayer. So how about if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was following the command of his Lord, “And recite the Qur’aan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style” [al-Muzzammil 73:4], and he used to make the bowing, rising, prostration and sitting between two prostrations lengthy, and the narrator of the hadeeth said: “to such an extent that one would think he had forgotten”? In the hadeeth of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him) it says: The prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his bowing, and when he raised his head from bowing, and when he prostrated, and the time between two prostrations were all nearly the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Shaamil fi Fiqh al-Khateeb wa’l-Khutbah (p. 154)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From this it is clear that it is not possible for this khateeb to deliver the Friday khutbah and offer the Jumu’ah prayer in ten minutes, unless there is clear undermining of both matters, the khutbah and the prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such a person needs to be told, because perhaps he may have misunderstood something from the Sunnah with regard to this matter, so he is spoiling both the khutbah and the prayer, whilst thinking that he is one of those who do good!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he does not respond to your telling him, then look for someone else who establishes the Sunnah in a proper way or close enough, and pray with him, and protect your prayer, and keep your heart sound. As for him who does not learn and does not want to, leave him to his own devices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>In our country the state allocates some mosques for people to observe i‘tikaaf in, and there are other mosques that are not allocated for i‘tikaaf. There are some people who want to observe i‘tikaaf in these mosques, I mean the ones that are not allocated by the state. Are the employees of these mosques sinning if they prevent these people from observing i‘tikaaf there, in accordance with the instructions of the government? Are they included in the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allaah’s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations) in Allaah’s mosques” [al-Baqarah 2:114]? If they are sinning by doing that, what about obeying the authorities? Especially since there are other mosques allocated for i‘tikaaf. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Mosques are the most honoured places on Earth; they are the     houses of Allah and were built for His worship by praying, reading Qu’'aan,     remembering Allah, seeking and teaching Islamic knowledge, and i‘tikaaf.     Concerning this, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)     said: “… rather they [mosques] are for the remembrance of Allaah, may He be     glorified and exalted, and prayer, and reading Qur’aan.” Narrated by Muslim     (285).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Every Muslim has the right to enter the mosques and worship     Allah there, so long as he does that in the prescribed fashion. Based on     that, whoever wants to observe i‘tikaaf in some mosque has the right to do     that, and no one has the right to prevent him from doing so. The one who     prevents him may be included in the meaning of this verse (interpretation of     the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “And who are more unjust than those who forbid that     Allaah’s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations)     in Allaah’s mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such     should themselves enter them (Allaah’s mosques) except in fear. For them     there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the     Hereafter”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:114].</p>\n<p>    i.e., no one is more unjust than those who do this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    This prohibition is reinforced if it is done because these     people who are observing i‘tikaaf are keen to follow the Sunnah and warn     people against innovation and tell them not to cause mischief on earth, so     restrictions are put on them to prevent them from observing i‘tikaaf in the     houses of Allah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Whoever strives -- in this case -- to prevent people from     observing i‘tikaaf and staying in the mosques to pray, read the Qur’aan and     remember Allah, is sinning and comes under the warning mentioned in this     verse. The one who helps him to do that is like him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the employees of the mosques, if they can take a     stance for the sake of Allah against preventing people from observing     i‘tikaaf in the mosques unjustly, this is what they should do, and they     cannot afford to do anything else. If they cannot do that, then they should     be gentle with the one who wants to observe i‘tikaaf and ask him to change     his mind, because it is not wise for a person to observe i‘tikaaf in the     mosque and thus cause harm to his Muslim brothers.</p>\n<p>    &nbsp;It may be better for him and for the Muslims to observe     i‘tikaaf in the mosques where i‘tikaaf is permitted, so that a large number     of Muslims will come together, and perhaps that will be a means of teaching     them some Islamic rulings that they do not know, or one of them may receive     sincere advice (naseehah) that will benefit him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Prohibiting i‘tikaaf in some mosques may be acceptable if the     mosque is small and does not have enough room for the worshippers, in which     case observing i‘tikaaf there would bother the worshippers and make the     place even more overcrowded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allah knows best. </p>\n",

      "title": "Does repentance bring back the reward for what was lost because of showing off?",
      "question": "<p>If someone does do a good deed with an intention other than to please Allah, then he or she repents, will he get the rewards after the repentance?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    There is evidence in the Sunnah to indicate that if a person     did a righteous deed whilst he was a kaafir, then he repented and became     Muslim, there will be recorded for him after his repentance the reward of     the righteous deeds that he did before, as if he did them in Islam. This is     the great generosity of Allaah and His immense bounty and kindness. Although     some scholars disagreed with that, this is the correct view and it is the     apparent meaning of the saheeh Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It was narrated from Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased     with him) that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think of     things that I did as acts of worship during the Jaahiliyyah such as giving     charity, freeing slaves and upholding the ties of kinship – is there any     reward for them? The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah be     upon him) said: “You have become Muslim with all your previous virtues.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1436) and Muslim (123).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Haafiz ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him)     said, commenting on this hadeeth:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a person did a righteous deed, then he did a bad deed     which cancelled it out, then he repented, then the reward that was lost     because of his bad deed will be restored to him. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Fath al-Baari by Ibn Rajab     (1/146)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him)     said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the hypocrite or show-off repents, does he have to repeat     (prayers etc), or will his repentance have the effect of reversal on the     deeds he did before that, so that he will be rewarded for them, or is it     that he does not have to repeat anything and will not be rewarded?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for repeating, the hypocrite does not have to do it at     all, because a group of hypocrites repented from hypocrisy at the time of     the Messenger of Allaah and he did not order any of them to repeat. And     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>    “and they could not find any cause to do so except that     Allaah and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If then they     repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away; Allaah will     punish them with a painful torment in this worldly life and in the     Hereafter”</p>\n<p>    [al-Tawbah 9:74]</p>\n<p>    Moreover, the hypocrite is inwardly a kaafir, so when he     believes he is forgiven what he did before, so he does not have to make     anything up, just as that is not required of the one who was outwardly a     kaafir when he becomes Muslim.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to his reward for what he did before, when he     repents he is like the kaafir if he did righteous deeds when he was a kaafir     then became Muslim -- will he be rewarded for it? In al-Saheehayn it     is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him)     said to Hakeem ibn Hizaam: “You have become Muslim with all your previous     virtues.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    With regard to the show-off, if he repents from showing off,     even though he believed it was obligatory, then it is similar to the issue     of what we are speaking of here, which is the issue of one who did not carry     out an obligatory duty, even if he was not inwardly a kaafir; obliging him     to make ups or repeat things is a major deterrent to repentance. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (22/20-21)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He also said (may Allaah have mercy on him):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The one who repents from sin is like the one who did not sin,     and if the sin is erased then the punishment and consequences are also     erased. Negation of good deeds is one of the consequences of sin. End     quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Sharh al-‘Umdah (1/39).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Chapter: if his recent bad deeds supersede his past good     deeds and cancel them out, then he repents sincerely from them, his good     deeds are restored to him and he does not come under the same ruling as one     who starts all over again, rather it is said to him: You have repented on     the basis that what you did previously of good deeds (will be kept for you).     The good deeds that he did in Islam are greater than the good deeds that the     kaafir did when he was a kaafir, such as freeing slaves, giving charity and     upholding the ties of kinship. Hakeem ibn Hizaam said: O Messenger of     Allaah, what do you think of things that I did as acts of worship during the     Jaahiliyyah such as giving charity, freeing slaves and upholding the ties of     kinship – is there any reward for them? The Messenger of Allaah (blessings     and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “You have become Muslim with all your     previous virtues.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    That is because sins that come between two acts of obedience     are erased by means of repentance, so it becomes as if they never happened,     and the two acts of obedience come together and will be counted together.     And Allaah knows best. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Madaarij al-Saalikeen (1/282)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The extent to which delaying prayer may be forgiven in the case of women",
      "question": "<p>Is a Muslim woman who prays at home considered to be sinning if she delays praying Zuhr until half an hour or a quarter of an hour before the adhaan of ‘Asr, or she prays ‘Asr half an hour or a quarter of an hour before the adhaan of Maghrib, or if she prays ‘Isha’ half an hour before the adhaan of Fajr? If the answer is that this is not permissible, what is the extent to which delaying the prayer may be allowed without incurring any sin?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>It is not permissible to delay prayers beyond the time when they are due, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:103]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As‑Salaah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”&nbsp;[Maryam 19:59]</p>\n<p>Islam has told us the times of the prayers, as described in the hadeeth which was narrated by Muslim (217) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet who said: “The time of Zuhr is so long as the time for ‘Asr has not begun, and the time for ‘Asr is so long as the sun has not begun to turn yellow, and the time for Maghrib is so long as the afterglow has not faded, and the time for ‘Isha’ is until midnight, and the time for Fajr is so long as the sun has not yet risen.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/9940\" target=\"_blank\">9940</a> we have explained the times of the five daily prayers in detail.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is sufficient here to mention the end of the time for each prayer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for Zuhr is when the time for ‘Asr begins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for ‘Asr is when the sun starts to turn yellow; the time is extended in cases of necessity, such as when a person is sick, etc., to when the sun sets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for Maghrib is when the red afterglow disappears from the sky, which is the beginning of the time for ‘Isha’.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for ‘Isha’ is midnight (halfway through the night), and it does not last until the time when dawn begins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The end of the time for Fajr is when the sun rises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is permissible to offer the prayer at any point within the time for that prayer, whether at the beginning, in the middle or at the end. It is not permissible to delay any of these prayers until after its time is over without a valid excuse such as sleeping or forgetting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on that, praying Zuhr half an hour or a quarter of an hour before ‘Asr is valid, and there is no sin on you in that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to ‘Asr, you must pray it before the sun turns yellow, and the timing of that varies from one season to another. It seems that quarter of an hour before Maghrib the sun will have turned yellow, so the time for ‘Asr will be over.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for you to delay ‘Isha’ until half an hour before Fajr, because the time for ‘Isha’ is up to midnight, as it says in the hadeeth. If you want to work out when midnight is, then calculate the time from sunset until dawn, and half way between the two is the end of the time for ‘Isha’ (this is midnight). If the sun sets at five o’clock and the adhan for Fajr is given at five o’clock, then midnight (or half way through the night) is eleven o’clock at night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is better to hasten to perform the prayers when the time for them begins, because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (496) and Muslim (122) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Which deed is most beloved to Allah?” He said: “Prayer offered on time.” He said, “Then what?” He said, “Honouring one’s parents.” He said: “Then what?” He said, “Jihad for the sake of Allah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>We put this question to our shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah preserve him), who answered as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I seek refuge with Allah!

Hence smokers must not smoke in front of their children, because by doing so they are teaching them to smoke.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
