      "title": "He gave her gifts to marry him; can he ask for the gifts to be returned if she refuses to marry him?",
      "question": "<p>I was engaged and my fincee gave me gifts and an amount of money to buy gold and the rest for going out (he is not from my country). Then I refused to marry him and asked to break the engagement, but he insisted on continuing. After all he asked for all what he gave me. Am I obliged to return the gold only, or all the gifts? Considering that I didn’t ask him for these, and some of them is no longer in my possession. Also, must I return the money he gave me, although he used it with me?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>If a man proposes marriage to a woman and offers her gifts to marry him, then she refuses to marry him, he has the right to ask her to give back the gifts that he gave her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (5/472): Even if the gifts were given before the marriage contract (nikaah) and they had promised marriage but then they gave the girl in marriage to someone else, he may take them back. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Mardaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Insaaf (8/296), after quoting the words of Shaykh al-Islam: I say: This is something concerning which there is no doubt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-Zarkashi al-Shaafa’i said in his book al-Manthoor fi’l-Qawaa’id al-Fiqhiyyah (3/269): If he proposes marriage to a woman and she accepts, and he brings them a gift then she does not marry him, then he may take back what he gave to her, because he only gave it on the basis that they were going to give her to him in marriage, and that did not happen. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus it is clear that the sister who is asking this question has to give back to this man everything that he gave to her, so long as she is the one who refused to marry him. Whatever of his gifts is still present should be returned and whatever has been used up or damaged should be replaced, or its value should be given.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-Jamal al-Shaafa’i said in his commentary on Sharh Manhaj al-Tullaab (4/129): It should be returned to him if it is still present and it should be replaced if it has been used up or damaged. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great scholar al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam (2/220): That which was given before the marriage contract is permissible and he may take it back if it is still present; this applies to items that are usually given to be used up. But with regard to items that are not usually used up, he may ask for their value if they are damaged, unless they refuse to go ahead with the marriage, in which case he has the right to ask for its value in both scenarios. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., if they refused to give her to him in marriage, he may take back the value if they have used up what they took from him, whether the items that he gave were consumable or not. This applies to items that the sister has consumed. But what he consumed himself he has no right to ask her for its value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the man is a stranger to his fiancée and it is not permissible for him to be alone with her or to shake hands with her or go out with her.</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Brother my question is fairly long and I hope inshallah you will be able to answer it to the best of your knowledge using hadith and Quranic proof to backup what you are saying and please use as much proof as you possible can.</div>\n<div> See the problem that I am facing is regarding the way in which my parents perform Ibadah and this way that they perform it they would like me to do the same but I personally did not feel that it went in accordance with the sunnah. My parents have a sufistic Qadriyanni belief in which they belief the Prophet Mohammed S.A.W was a Noor and a human. A Sufi Alim who is a Mufti gave my dad a type of Ibadah style book written in Urdu and Dua's in Arabic he told him to do this Ibadah in particular every single day and with Your children who are able to recite Quran and your wife loudly together.</div>\n<div>The form of Ibadah goes as following before starting he told us to recite the words</div>\n<div>\"Allahumma Salliallah Muhamadin Wa'lihi Wa Itratihi beadadikuli malumilaka he refers to it as Darud Qadri</div>\n<div> then he told us to recite these words 100 times \"Subhanallahi wabihamdihi Subhanallahhilazeem Astagfirullahalazimalazi La Illaha Illa huwalhayalqayoom wa atoobu alayhi\"</div>\n<div>then he told us to recite 7 times surah fatiha  </div>\n<div>then he told us to recite 100 times   \"Allahumma Salliallah Muhamadin Wa'lihi Wa Itratihi beadadikuli malumilaka he refers to it as Darud Qadri  </div>\n<div>the he told us to recite 79 times Surah allamnashra  </div>\n<div> then recite surah Ikhlas 100 times  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times these words   \"allahuma ya qadiyal hajate  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times these words   \"allahuma ya dafi al balayati\"  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"allahuma ya ah lal mushkalati  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"allahuma ya kafiyal muhimati  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Allahuma ya mujeebadawati  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"allahuma ya shafi mar da'\"  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Allahuma ya khayranaseereena\"  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Bihrahmatikaya ya arhamarahimeen  </div>\n<div>then recite 100 times   \"Allahuma ameen\"  </div>\n<div>the 2nd part to this Ibadah is the same thing accept some things changed around such as starting off with the words \"hazbunallahu\" 500 times and following it through the same way acept without Surah Allahmnashra or Ikhlas.</div>\n<div>Now I know some of these words are in the Quran and the surahs are for sure but I would like to know the meanings for everything english translation i'm sorry i cannot find it in arabic but try to soundout the meaning please. I would like to know if this form of Ibadah is in accordance with the Sunnah. If the Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W) ever recited it. My parents want me to do the Ibadah with them and they get very angry even if i question it the slightest bit because they say what do you know your so young. The alim who came has been studying for more then 60 years who are you to question them. So brother please answer my question in as much depth as possible and as much proof you can possibly have if this Dua is sunnah or just an innovation. As well i forgot to mention there is this other thing my parents want me to do after i do this supplication   which is that i recite Surah 105 in the Quran and when it gets to a part where you say tarmihim to say tarmeem and take these rocks one by one bouncing them off of a metal bowl turned upside down covered with a red sheet to represent blood. My parents tell me this is to ask allah to strike down on the enemies of ours killing them off or something close to that. I would like to know of this is the sunnah of the Prophet MOhammed (S.A.W) or if its an innovation please provide lots of proof and be as clear as possible so my parents will understand. I know I am asking for a lot but I would really appreciate if you could answer me as soon as possible.</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The purpose for which we were created is to worship Allah alone with no partner or associate, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)”</p>\n<p>[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has not left us each to choose his own way of worship, rather He has sent His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and revealed His holy Book, to show people the way and guide them. So there is nothing that is worship and goodness and guidance that Allah loves, but it has been explained by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No two Muslims dispute that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best and most pious of mankind, the one who worshipped Allah and turned to Him the most. Hence the one who is truly guided is the one who follows his path and walks in his footsteps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adhering to the path of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not something that is optional, rather it is an obligation that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). And fear Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”</p>\n<p>[al-Hashr 59:7]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:36]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day”</p>\n<p>[al-Ahzaab 33:21]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that every innovated kind of worship would be rejected and thrown back at the one who does it, no matter what it is. He said: “Every action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] will be rejected.” Narrated by Muslim, 1718, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No deed will be accepted unless it is done sincerely for the sake of Allah and in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“that He may test you which of you is best in deed”</p>\n<p>[al-Mulk 67:2]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: (This means) that which is most sincere and most correct. They said, O Abu ‘Ali, what most sincere and most correct? He said: If a deed is not sincere and not correct, it will not be accepted. If it is correct but is not sincere, it will not be accepted unless it is both sincere and correct. Sincere means that it is done for the sake of Allah and correct means that it is in accordance with the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whoever wants to attain the pleasure of Allah, he has to adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). All paths to Allah are blocked, except this path, the path of His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was compassionate towards his ummah and cared deeply for them, he did not leave anything good without explaining it to them. So whoever today invents an act of worship, dhikr or wird and claims that it is good, is accusing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – whether he realizes it or not – of not conveying the religion as Allah commanded him to do. Hence Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever introduces any innovation into Islam claiming that it is good is implying that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) betrayed the message entrusted to him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”</p>\n<p>[al-Maa'idah 5:3]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So whatever was not part of the religion of Islam at that point should never be part of the religion of Islam today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and imams issued many warnings against innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan said: Every act of worship which the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do, do not do it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Mas’ood said: Follow and do not innovate, for the religion is complete. Adhere to the old way (i.e., the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sahaabah)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The question which should be put to the one who invented this dhikr is:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do this? Did the Sahaabah do this?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The obvious answer is that reciting these soorahs these number of times – 100 times or 7 or 79 – is something that was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or from any of his companions. The same is true of the du’aa’s recited in this manner for the number of times mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be said to this innovator: do you think that you have discovered something good that was not known to the Prophet or his companions?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Or do you think that you or your shaykh have the right to introduce new laws and to define news dhikrs and when they should be said and how often they should be repeated, just as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had that right?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly both of these are manifest misguidance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let us think about the report narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood by al-Daarimi in his Sunan, according to which Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said to ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood: “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, I have just seen in the mosque something new that I was not sure about, but I think I have not seen anything but something good, praise be to Allah.” He said, “What was it?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “You will see it tomorrow.” He said, “I saw some people in the mosque sitting in circles waiting for the prayer. In every circle there was a man and in their hands were pebbles. He would say, ‘Say Allahu akbar one hundred times,’ so they would say Allahu akbar (takbeer) one hundred times. Then he would say, ‘Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (tahleel) one hundred times, so they would say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah one hundred times. Then he would say, ‘Say Subhaan Allah (tasbeeh) one hundred times,’ and they would say Subhaan Allah one hundred times.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “What did you say to them?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “I did not say anything to them. I was waiting for your opinion.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “Why did you not tell them to count their bad deeds and promise them that none of their good deeds would be lost?’ Then he went away and we went with him, until he came to one of those circles. He stood over them and said, “What is this that I see you doing?”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They said, “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, these are pebbles with which we count the takbeer, tahleel and tasbeeh.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “Count your bad deeds, for I promise you that nothing of your good deeds will be lost. Woe to you, O ummah of Muhammad, how soon you have drifted into the way of doom even though the companions of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are still alive amongst you, and his garments and the vessels he used are still not worn out or broken. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, either you are following a way that is more guided than the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or you are starting a way that is the way of misguidance.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>They said, “By Allah, O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “How many of those who intend good never attain it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not everyone who seeks or intends good attains it and is guided to it. Not every act of worship is accepted, unless it is in accordance with the Sunnah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This denunciation by Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) puts an end to the argument presented by innovators, because they always say, “What reason can there be not to recite dhikr, prayers and Qur’aan? We only intend good and to draw closer to Allah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be said to them: Worship must be something that is prescribed in sharee’ah in essence and in its form and the manner in which it is done. If a specific number is prescribed in sharee’ah then no one has the right to go beyond that, and if no number or way is specified then no one has the right to invent a limit for it, because that implies that one is assuming the role of a lawgiver. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is further supported by the report narrated from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib (may Allah have mercy on him). He saw a man praying more than two rak’ahs after dawn had come (i.e., Fajr), and he told him not to do that. The man said, “O Abu Muhammad, will Allah punish me for praying?!”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “No, but He will punish you for going against the Sunnah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Look at the understanding of this great Taabi’i, may Allah have mercy on him. That is because the regular Sunnah is to pray only two rak’ahs after the dawn has come, not more than that, then to pray the obligatory prayer of Fajr.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A similar report was narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him). A man came to him and said: “O Abu ‘Abd-Allah, from where should I enter ihraam?”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;He said, “From Dhu’l-Hulayfah, from where the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered ihraam.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “I want to enter ihraam from the Mosque, from near the grave (meaning the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “Do not do that, for I fear fitnah (trial, affliction) for you.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “What fitnah is that? It is just a few miles I am adding.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>He said, “What fitnah is greater than your thinking that you have found something good that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) failed to do?! I heard that Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad’s) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them’</p>\n<p>[al-Noor 24:63].”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the understanding of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Imams. As for the people of bid’ah, they say, “What fitnah? It is only dhikr and prayer and a few miles by which we seek to draw closer to Allah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No wise person should be deceived by the words of these people, for the Shaytaan has made their deeds appear attractive to them, and they hate to go against their shaykhs and the leaders of their tareeqahs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Bid’ah (innovation) is dearer to Iblees (Satan) than sin, because a person may repent from sin, but not from innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted that no one ever invents a bid’ah but he forsakes thereby a Sunnah that is equal to it or greater than it. Hence those who favour innovated dhikrs are the most ignorant of people about the Prophet’s dhikr which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) persisted in reciting. You will rarely find any of them who says in the morning and evening, Subhaan-Allah wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to Allah) one hundred times; or Asbahna ‘ala fitrat il-Islam wa kalimat il-ikhlaas wa deeni nabiyyina Muhammad sall-Allahu ‘alay wa sallim wa millati abeena Ibraaheema haneefan wa maa kaana min al-mushrikeen (We have awoken on the fitrah of Islam and the word of sincerity and the religion of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the religion of our father Ibraaheem, pure monotheism, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah); or Asbahna wa asbah al-mulk Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen. Allahumma inni as’aluka khayra hadha’l-yawm fa-thahu wa nasrahu wa noorahu wa barakatahu wa hudaahu, wa a’oodhu bika min sharri ma fihi wa sharri ma ba’dahu (We have awoken and dominion belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah I ask You for the good of this day and its goodness, support, help, light, blessing and guidance. And I seek refuge with You from the evil of what is in it and the evil of what comes after it): or Subhaan Allah ‘adada khalqihi, Subhaan Allah ridaa nafsihi, Subhaan Allah zinata ‘arshihi, Subhaan Allah midaada kalimaatihi (Glory be to Allah the number of His creation, Glory be to Allah as much as He is pleased with, Glory be to Allah the weight of His Throne, Glory be to Allah the extent of His words).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And there are other dhikrs with which you may be content, from the books that contain the dhikrs for the morning and the evening, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The point is that it is not permissible to join your parents in these innovated dhikrs and say them the number of times you mention.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to what you mentioned about Soorat al-Feel and throwing stones when saying tarmeehim (striking them), this is a myth and is nonsense. It is not permissible to do this or to seek to draw closer to Allah by doing it. How many enemies did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confront, and he did not pray against them in this manner. There is the fear that this is a way of drawing closer to the devils and seeking their help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>With regard to the belief that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was light (noor), there is no basis for this and it was not narrated either in the Qur’aan or saheeh Sunnah. Allah has told us that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a human being like us, except that Allah favoured him with revelation and the message. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</div>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God i.e. Allah)’”</p>\n<p>[al-Kahf 18:110]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allah), therefore take Straight Path to Him (with true Faith Islamic Monotheism) and obedience to Him, and seek forgiveness of Him. And woe to Al‑Mushrikoon (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah)’”</p>\n<p>[Fussilat 41:6]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of the extreme Sufis believe that he was light, and that he was the first thing created by Allah, and that the rest of creation was created from his light. This is a lie and is misguidance for which they have no evidence apart from a false, fabricated hadeeth. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask Allah to help you and your parents to avoid innovation and its people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "He wants to pray to Allah to let him live until he witnesses the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) at the end of time",
      "question": "<p>My question is that can i make dua so that i am able to live until i see isa peace be upon him return to earth and to see all these signs? This could strengthen my faith alot. So can is it possible for me to make dua to live this long?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with the Muslim asking his Lord to give him a long life of obedience to Him. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked: Who is the best of people? He said: “The one who lives a long life and does good deeds.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2329); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12372/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12372</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The descent of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary – peace be upon him) will happen at the end of time. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) from heaven will happen at the end of time. End quote.</p>\n<p>Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 8/234.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a href=\"https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/43840/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">43840</a>.</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>It is possible that some people of this ummah may live long enough to see him (peace be upon him); that is not impossible. Al-Haakim (8635) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you lives to see ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, let him convey greetings of salaam to him from me.” Blessings and peace of Allah be upon them both.</p>\n<p>Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (1981).</p>\n<p>Ahmad (7971) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: If I live a long life, I hope that I may live to see ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, but if death comes to me before that, then whoever lives to see him, let him convey greetings of salaam to him from me.</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad.</p>\n<p>But this possibility is one thing, and asking to witness the descent of ‘Eesa is something else. His descent will come at the end of time, as mentioned above, and the turmoil and tribulations of the end of time will be many and ongoing. The one who asks Allah to let him see him has in fact asked Allah to let him live until he sees a time of turmoil and tribulation, especially since ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will descend at the time of the Dajjaal, which will be the greatest and worst of tribulations, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Between the creation of Adam and the onset of the Hour there is no matter of greater impact than the Dajjaal.” Narrated by Muslim (2946) and Ahmad (16255).</p>\n<p>The Muslim should seek to avoid tribulations and the places and times where they occur, and ask Allah to keep him safe from them, so how about the greatest of tribulations that will have the most severe impact on people?</p>\n<p>Abu Dawood (4319) narrated that ‘Imraan ibn Husayn said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjaal, let him go far away from him, for by Allah a man will come to him thinking that he is a believer, and he will follow him because of the specious arguments that he offers, or because of the specious arguments with which he is sent.”</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.</p>\n<p>So whoever witnesses the coming of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will also witness the coming of the Dajjaal, and the Muslim does not ask Allah to let him live to see the time of tribulation, and he is not the one who exposes himself to that. Rather he asks Allah to keep him safe from it. He does not ask for something that is unclear to him and he does not know – if he witnesses it – how he will fare in that case.</p>\n<p>Ahmad (23810) narrated that Jubayr ibn Nufayr said: We sat with al-Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad one day, and a man passed by him and said: Glad tidings to these two eyes that saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). By Allah we wish that we had seen what you saw and witnessed what you witnessed. He got angry, and I was surprised, for he had not said anything but good words. Then he turned to him and said: What makes a man wish for to be present at a time that Allah willed that he should not be, and he does not know, if he was there, how he would have fared? By Allah, people were present with and saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) whom Allah will throw on their faces in Hell. They did not respond to him and they did not believe him. Why do you not praise Allah for having been brought up knowing nothing but your Lord, believing in what your Prophet brought, and you were sufficed against trials and tests?</p>\n<p>Classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad.</p>\n<p>So none of us should wish for something that he was not meant to witness, and he does not know how he would fare in that situation.

      "title": "She had a miscarriage after entering ihraam for ‘umrah of Hajj tamattu‘; can she do tawaaf, and how should she complete her Hajj?",
      "question": "<p>If a woman in the early months of pregnancy starts bleeding, and it is not regular menstrual bleeding, rather it is a miscarriage, and she is doing tamattu‘ [‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihraam in between], what should she do when she has already entered ihraam for ‘umrah? Can she do tawaf? Is her Hajj regarded as not being valid? Please note that she has come from a distant country and must return to her country by plane on a certain date, accompanied by her husband.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>If a woman has a miscarriage, and that was after human features had appeared in the foetus, then the bleeding that occurs because of that is regarded as nifaas. If it happens before human features appear in the foetus, then the bleeding is regarded as istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding], which does not prevent her from praying or doing tawaaf.</p>\n<p>Human features do not appear in the foetus before eighty days of pregnancy. See the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/37784\">37784</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on that, with regard to this woman who had a miscarriage, if the miscarriage occurred before eighty days of pregnancy, then the bleeding is not nifaas; rather it is istihaadah, so it does not prevent her from praying or doing tawaaf, but she must do wudoo’ for each prayer.</p>\n<p>If the miscarriage occurred after the soul had been blown into the foetus – i.e., after one hundred and twenty days of pregnancy, then the blood is definitely nifaas.</p>\n<p>If the miscarriage occurred after eighty days and before one hundred and twenty days, then the foetus should be examined; if human features can be seen, then the bleeding is nifaas, but if there are no human features, then the bleeding is istihaadah.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>If the bleeding is nifaas, and she had already entered ihraam for ‘umrah, then she cannot circumambulate the Ka‘bah (tawaaf) according to the majority of fuqahaa’; rather she must wait until she becomes pure [i.e., her nifaas ends] – even if that happens before forty days. If she does not become pure before ‘Arafah, she should enter ihraam for Hajj, and will then be doing qiraan [‘umrah followed by Hajj without exiting ihraam in between]. She should do everything that the pilgrims do, namely standing [in ‘Arafah], stoning the Jamaraat and staying overnight in Mina, but she should not do tawaaf until she becomes pure. This is the view of the majority of scholars.</p>\n<p>If she cannot stay in Makkah until she becomes pure, then she may take medicine to stop the bleeding, so that she will be able to do tawaaf when she is in a state of purity. ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq narrated in his Musannaf (1/318) that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a woman whose menstrual bleeding was lengthy in duration, and she wanted to take medicine to stop the bleeding. Ibn ‘Umar did not see anything wrong with that, and he recommended araak water [that is, he prescribed that medicine for her]. Mu‘ammar said: I heard Ibn Abi Nujayh being asked about that, and he did not see anything wrong with it.</p>\n<p>It was narrated from ‘Ata’ that he was asked about a woman who was menstruating, then she was given some medicine to stop her menses before it ended naturally; could she do tawaaf? He said: Yes, if she sees the tuhr (white discharge signalling the end of menses). But if she sees traces of blood, and does not see the white tuhr, then she should not do tawaaf.</p>\n<p>What is meant by traces is a little blood or light bleeding when the menses has nearly ended.</p>\n<p>If she cannot take this medicine or she fears that she may be harmed by it, then Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that if she cannot stay in Makkah because she is part of a group that will leave soon, and she cannot come back in order to do tawaaf, then in that case she has no choice, so she should take measures to prevent the blood from falling onto the ground, and do tawaaf. Some of the scholars have issued fatwas to this effect.</p>\n<p>The Permanent Committee for Iftaa’ was asked:&nbsp; A woman came in ihram for ‘umrah, and after reaching Makkah she got her menses. Her mahram has to leave immediately and she does not have anyone in Makkah. What is the ruling?</p>\n<p>They replied: If the matter is as described, that the woman got her menses before doing tawaaf, and she is still in ihram, and her mahram has to leave immediately, and she has no mahram or husband in Makkah, then the condition of being in a state of purity and free of menses in order to enter the mosque and do tawaaf is waived in her case, out of necessity, and she should put on a sanitary pad and do tawaaf and sa‘i for her ‘umrah, unless it is easy for her to leave and then come back with her husband or mahram because she does not live too far away and it is easy for her to come back. In that case, she should leave and come back as soon as her menses ends in order to do the tawaaf of her ‘umrah in a state of purity. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>\n<p>“Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>\n<p>“[Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:78]</p>\n<p>“So fear Allah as much as you are able”</p>\n<p>[at-Taghaabun 64:16].</p>\n<p>The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If I instruct you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can.” And there are other religious texts which confirm that making things easy and avoiding hardship are religious objectives. What we have mentioned was also indicated in fatwas issued by a number of scholars, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his student, al-‘Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them both). End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah (2/238).</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: A woman got her menses when she had not done tawaaf al-ifaadah, and she lives outside the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia). The time has come for her to leave the Kingdom; she cannot delay her departure and it is impossible for her to return to the Kingdom once more. What is the ruling?</p>\n<p>He replied: If the matter is as described, a woman has not done tawaaf al-ifaadah, and she has got her menses and cannot remain in Makkah or come back to it if she leaves before doing tawaaf, then in this case she may take one of two measures: either she may have an injection to stop the bleeding, and then do tawaaf; or she may put on a sanitary pad to prevent the blood contaminating the mosque, and do tawaaf, as this is a case of necessity. The view that we have mentioned here is the most correct view, and is the one that was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. Or the other alternative is to do one of two things: either to remain in whatever state of ihram she is in, in which case she is not permissible for her husband, and it is not permissible for a marriage contract to be done with her if she is not married; or she is to be regarded as being like one who was prevented from reaching the Ka‘bah, so she should offer her sacrifice and exit her ihram. In that case, her Hajj will not count. Both of these options are difficult, so the correct view is that of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) regarding such cases of necessity. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>\n<p>“[Allah] has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty”</p>\n<p>[al-Hajj 22:78]</p>\n<p>“Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship”</p>\n<p>[al-Baqarah 2:185].</p>\n<p>But if this woman is able to travel then come back when she has become pure, there is nothing wrong with her leaving, then when she becomes pure (following the end of her menses), she may come back and do the tawaaf of Hajj. But during the intervening period, she cannot be intimate with her husband, because she has not completed the second stage of exiting ihram. End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah (2/237).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>If this woman thinks it most likely that her bleeding will not stop before ‘Arafah, in addition to knowing that she will not be able to stay in Makkah until she becomes pure, then she should do tawaaf for ‘umrah and exit ihraam therefrom, then enter ihraam again for Hajj, and her Hajj will be valid. However, it is better for her to do what is mentioned above, namely joining Hajj to ‘umrah, so that she will be doing qiraan. It may so happen that she becomes pure one or two days after ‘Arafah, in which case she will be able to do tawaaf when she is in a state of purity.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Can Women Perform Hajj Qiran for Ease?",
      "question": "<p>A man has several elderly women with him; which is better, Tamattu` (doing Hajj and `Umrah together, exiting ihram in between) or Qiran (doing Hajj and `Umrah together, without exiting ihram in between)? Because the Qur’an waives sa`i in the case of Qiran, and it is also possible for a woman to combine Tawaf Al-ifadah and the farewell Tawaf, and that will be easier for the older women. Do you advise older women to do Tamattu` or Qiran?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, in our times it is difficult for many pilgrims, if they are doing Tamattu`, to do the Tawaf of `Umrah and the Sa`i of `Umrah, then to do the Tawaf of Hajj and the Sa`i of Hajj, then to do the Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf Al-Wada`).</p>\n<p>So some women think that they should do Qiran, so when they reach Makkah, they do Tawaf Al-Qudum (the Tawaf of Arrival), and they do one Sa`i for both Hajj and `Umrah, and they do not repeat Sa`i.</p>\n<p>In this regard, Qiran is easier than Tamattu`. It is also easier than Tamattu` from another angle,&nbsp;because if a person does Qiran, he can delay Tawaf until after he has done Hajj. In other words, it is permissible for him not to do Tawaf upon arrival and not to do Sa`i; rather he enters Ihram for Hajj and `Umrah together, then he goes out to Mina and completes Hajj, then after that he does Tawaf and Sa`i when he is able to, even if that is after the 13th&nbsp;or 14th&nbsp;or 15th&nbsp;days of Dhul-Hijjah, or at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>So Qiran is easier than Tamattu` in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The pilgrim only has to do one Tawaf and one Sa`i;</li>\n<li>The one who is doing Qiran does not have to do Tawaf or Sa`i as soon as he arrives; rather he may go out to Mina and complete Hajj, then when it is easy for him, he can do Tawaf and Sa`i.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on that, we say, if this is easier, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he chose the easier of the two, so long as it was not a sin.</p>\n<p>Qiran is not a sin; rather it is one of the ways of doing Hajj, and the one who does it does `Umrah and Hajj and also offers a sacrifice, because the one who is doing Qiran must offer a sacrifice, like the one who does Tamattu`.

It also does not tell you to stay away from anything unless it is bad for you. You will notice the change in the way you look at things, the minute you become a Muslim. You will feel more relieved and secure only to think that you are fulfilling the orders of Allah. Doing this, you will clearly see the benefits of it for yourself and for mankind. You can embrace Islam in any Islamic center. This is only a formality.

This is the view of Mutarrif among the companions     of Maalik.

Some scholars say     that what brings the multiple reward in al-Masjid al-Haraam is the five     daily prayers only, and other prayers do not bring the multiple reward. What     appears to be the case from the apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that it     includes all prayers, and the janaazah prayer is included in this general     meaning of the reward for prayers in al-Masjid al-Haraam being multiplied.
