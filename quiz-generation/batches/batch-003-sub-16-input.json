      "title": "The meaning of the hadeeth, “Whoever taunts his brother with a sin” and how sound it is",
      "question": "<p> </p>\n<div>Hadhrat Muaaz (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:</div>\n<div>\"Whoever taunts a brother (Muslim) with a sin (which the Muslim has committed), will not die until he the taunter) commits the same sin.\"</div>\n<div>Could you please xplain this Hadith in further detail?</div>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, (Kitaab Sifat al-Qiyaamah wa’l-Wara’, 2429), where the wording is,&nbsp; “Whoever shames his brother for a sin will not die until he does it too.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Albaani described this hadith in Da’eef al-Jaami’ (5710) as mawdoo’ (fabricated).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a hadith is da’eef (weak) and mawdoo’ (fabricated), it cannot be taken as a basis for rulings or be acted upon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the meaning of the hadith, Shaykh al-Mubaarakfoori said:</p>\n<p>“ ‘Whoever shames’ means whoever criticizes or condemns. ‘his brother’ means his brother in faith. ‘For a sin’ means one from which he has repented, according to the way in which Imaam Ahmad explained it. ‘will not die’ – the subject of this verb is ‘whoever’. ‘Until he does it too’ means, the sin for which he criticizes his brother. It is as if the one who criticizes his brother will be forsaken by Allah until he commits the sin for which he criticized his brother, if that criticism was accompanied by self-admiration for being free of that sin.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 7/173)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact that this hadith is da’eef (weak) does not mean that it is permissible to criticize those who have fallen into sin, for those who fall into sin are of different types.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of them repent and turn back to their Lord, or else the punishment (hadd) is carried out on them. So it is not permissible to criticize them because their souls have been purified by their repentance or the punishment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who has never sinned.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4240; classed as saheeh by al-Busayri in al-Zawaa’id, commentary on Sunan Ibn Maajah).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imam Ahmad said that the punishment mentioned in the hadith is for the one who criticizes a person who has repented from his sin, as al-Tirmidhi narrated from him.&nbsp; After narrating this hadith, he said: Ahmad said: from a sin from which he has repented.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of them commit sin but they do not do it openly. Anyone who comes to know of that has to advise the person and cover his faults.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And some of them commit sin openly. They should also be advised, and others should be warned against them to whatever extent is appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It may be that what he meant is that your criticizing your brother for his sin is an even greater sin than his, because it means that you feel pride in your obedience and you are praising yourself for that, and claiming to be free from sin, whereas your brother has fallen into sin. But it may be that his feeling humble because of his sin and what has happened to him, such as his feeling humble and submissive, thinking less of himself, ridding himself of pious pretensions, arrogance and self-admiration, standing before Allah with his head bowed, his gaze lowered and his heart broken – it may be that all of that is better for him than your feeling proud of your obedience, thinking that you are doing much good, believing that by doing so you are important, and reminding Allah and mankind of that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How close this sinner is to the mercy of Allah, and how close this conceited one is to the wrath of Allah! A sin that leads to humility is more beloved to Him than an act of obedience which fills a person with conceit. If you sleep all night then wake up feeling regret (for not having prayed qiyaam al-layl), that may be better for you than if you were to pray all night and wake up in the morning filled with self-admiration. For the deeds of the one who admires himself are not accepted. Perhaps your laughing whilst admitting to shortcomings is better than your weeping with piety but being filled with conceit. The groaning of the sinners is more beloved to Allah than the tasbeeh of the conceited. It may be that by means of this sin, Allah has caused him to drink the medicine that will cure a fatal disease which you also have, but you do not realize it. Allah has reason for what He does to both those who are obedient and those who sin, which are known to no-one except Him, and which no one recognizes except those who have insight, and then only within the limits of human understanding; beyond that there are reasons which are not even known to the honourable scribes (i.e., the recording angels). The Prophet said: “If the slave woman of any one of you commits adultery, let him carry out the punishment on her and not criticize.” And Yoosuf (peace be upon him) said: “No reproach on you this day” [Yoosuf 12:92 – interpretation of the meaning]. For the scale is in the hand of Allah, and the ruling is His. The point is to carry out the punishment (prescribed by Allah) and not to shame and criticize. No one feels safe from what has been decreed for them and from the power of His decree except those who are ignorant of Allah. Allah said to the one who had more knowledge of Him than anyone else and was closer to Him: “And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little”[al-Israa’ 17:74 – interpretation of the meaning]. And Yoosuf said: “Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of the ignorant”[Yoosuf 12:33 – interpretation of the meaning]. One of the ways in which the Messenger of Allah used to swear was “No, by the One who turns hearts.” And he said, “There is no heart which is not between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful. If He wills He guides it aright and if He wills He sends it astray.” Then he said, “O Allah, the one Who turns hearts over, make our hearts steadfast in adhering to Your religion. O Allah, musrif al-Quloob, sirf our hearts to obey You.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/177, 178)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "She is not sure that she is really her father’s child",
      "question": "<p>What is my destiny, to paradise or hell if I was a daughter of adultery and I was just written in the name of the man I live with as father? What shall I do? Shall I expose this reality and go to detention? Or just stay silent and conceal my family’s secret? How shall I live with a brother who is not from the same father? May Allah forgive my mother, she destroyed me. I am a religious girl, Alhamdulillah. Do not suppose this is untrue and ask for a proof that I am not his daughter, because there is strong resemblance between me and the man whom my mother committed adultery with. Help me, what shall I do?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The child of adultery is not responsible for the crime     committed by his mother, and he is not to be taken to task for it, rather he     is responsible for his own actions. If he is righteous and obedient then he     will be one of the people of Paradise, and if he is a disobedient evildoer     then he will deserve to enter Hell. So in this regard he is like all other     people, and there is no difference between him and them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If a woman has a husband and she bears a child who could be     from that husband (in that he is born after six months of marriage), then     this child should be attributed to her husband according to sharee’ah, and     it is not permissible to deny that he belongs to him, unless the husband     himself denies it and engages in li’aan with his wife to that effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari     (2053) and Muslim (1457) which says that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas and ‘Abd ibn     Zam’ah disputed concerning a slave belonging to Zam’ah.&nbsp; Sa’d said: O     Messenger of Allaah, this is the son of my brother, ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas,     who asked me to take care of him because he is his son. ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah     said: This is my brother, O Messenger of Allaah, the son of my father’s     slave woman who was born in my father’s bed. The Messenger of Allaah (S) saw     a clear resemblance to ‘Utbah. But he said: “He is yours, O ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah.     The child is for the (owner of the) bed.” Then he said to Sawdah bint     Zam’ah, who was one of the Mothers of the Believers (may Allaah be pleased     with them): “Observe hijab from him, O Sawdah.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    If the child was born in the marital bed, he is to be     attributed to the husband, and he cannot be regarded as not being his child     except by means of li’aan, where the husband engages in li’aan with his wife     and denies that the child is his, in which case physical resemblance is of     no significance. It is clear from the hadeeth quoted above that the child     concerning whom there was a dispute bore a clear resemblance to the zaani,     ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas. This case of zina had taken place during the     Jaahiliyyah (i.e., before Islam), and Sa’d wanted to attribute the slave to     his brother who had left instructions to that effect (before he died), but     the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ruled that the     child belonged to the marital bed and attributed him to Zam’ah, who was the     master of the slave woman. But in order to be on the safe side, he told     Sawdah bint Zam’ah to observe hijab before this brother of hers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    So in this case there was both an admission of zina and a     clear resemblance (to the zaani), but despite that the Prophet  (peace     and blessings of Allaah be upon him) affirmed that the child was to be     attributed to the owner of the marital bed. This is because sharee’ah takes     a cautious view in order to protect lineages and is keen to conceal sins,     for the lineage is the child’s right.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh     Muslim: With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Observe hijab from him, O Sawdah”, he     told her to do that so as to be on the safe side, because he appeared to be     her brother in shar’i terms, because he was attributed to her father, but     when he saw that he clearly resembled ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas, he was afraid     that he may have been his child, in which case he would be a stranger     (non-mahram) to her, so he told her to observe hijab before him in order to     be on the safe side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The     custom during the Jaahiliyyah was to name children after the zaani. They     used to hire slave woman for zina, and whoever the mother said that the     child belonged to, they would name him after him. Then Islam came and     abolished that, and ruled that the child belonged to the legitimate marriage     bed. When ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah and Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas disputed, Sa’d did what     his brother ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas had asked him to do, in accordance with     the custom of Jaahiliyyah, and Sa’d was not aware that this had been     abolished in Islam. The child’s paternity had not been stated during the     Jaahiliyyah, either because there was no claim or because the mother did not     acknowledge that he was ‘Utbah’s child. ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah claimed that he had     been born on his father’s bed, so the Prophet  (peace and blessings of     Allaah be upon him) ruled in his favour. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: They were     unanimously agreed that if a child is born on one man’s bed and another man     claims him, he should not be named after him. End quote from al-Mughni     (6/228).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on that, if you were born six months or more after your     father married your mother, then you should be named after your father, and     your lineage cannot be denied except by means of li’aan. You have no need to     have doubts about your mother or think badly of her because you resemble     someone else, because people may resemble one another without there being     any zina.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Whatever the case, resemblance to the zaani or the woman’s     admission of zina does not mean that the child cannot be attributed to the     husband, unless the husband engages in li’aan. See the answer to question     no. <a href=\"/en/answers/33615\" class=\"LinkFatwa\">33615</a> for information on li’aan and its consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    What you should do is ignore this matter and stop thinking     about it, and pay attention to doing righteous deeds and adhering to this     religion properly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to guide you and help you to do that which He     has permitted and that which pleases Him. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I would like to know if it is allowed for a man, when he is married to two wives to take the second wife every time if he will travel, even if the first wife cannot go because of her children. What can she do if she feels that he do not want to divide his time equally between them. Please advice a good website with answers on polygamy.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has enjoined justice and fairness in all things. He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Allah commands justice [and] the doing of good”&nbsp;[al-Nahl 16:90]</p>\n<p>Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this Book that He revealed to you, O Muhammad, Allah enjoins justice, which is fairness.\"(Tafseer al-Tabari&nbsp; 17/279).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has forbidden injustice and wrongdoing (zulm) to His slaves, and He warns those who are unjust or do wrong of punishment in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, narrating from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted: “ ‘O My slaves, I have forbidden zulm to Myself and I have made it haraam among you, so do not wrong one another.” Narrated by Muslim (2577).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allah has enjoined justice and fairness between co-wives, and there is a warning against wronging one of them at the expense of another. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice”&nbsp;[al-Nisa’ 4:3]</p>\n<p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>i.e., the one who wants to take two or three or four wives may do so, but no more than that, because the context of the verse reminds people of the blessings of Allah, so it is not permissible to add anything to the number that Allah has defined, according to scholarly consensus. That is because a man’s desire may not be fulfilled by one wife, so it is permitted for him to take more, up to four, because four is sufficient for anyone, except in rare cases. However, that is only permitted to him if he is confident that he will not be unfair and unjust, and that he will be able to give them their rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If he is afraid that any of this applies to him, then he should limit himself to one, or to slaves that his right hand possesses, because he is not obliged to divide his time equally when it comes to slave women.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“That”, i.e., limiting yourself to one or to what your right hand possesses (slave women)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice” i.e., being unfair or unjust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Limiting it to one applies in the case where a person fears he may be unjust or unfair, and may fail to do what is required, so he should err on the side of caution and not put himself in that position.\"(Tafseer al-Sa’di&nbsp; p. 163).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives and favours one of them over the other, will come on the Day of Resurrection with one of his sides leaning.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1141), Abu Dawood (2133), al-Nasaa’i (3942) and Ibn Majaah (1969). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb (no. 1949).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Teebi said in his commentary on the words “with one of his sides leaning”, i.e., tilting. And it was said that this will be in such a way that all the people on the Day of Resurrection will see him, so this will increase his punishment.\"(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi&nbsp; 4/248).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a wife sees that her husband is favouring her co-wife at her expense, or is being unjust to her with regard to her rights, she should hasten to advise her husband in the way that is best, and remind him of what Allah has enjoined of justice, and what Allah has forbidden of injustice. She should also hasten to advise her co-wife not to accept this injustice, and not to take anything that is not rightfully hers. Perhaps Allah will guide him to be just and to give each one her due rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One aspect of justice between co-wives is for the husband to draw lots if he wants to travel with one wife and not the other(s). This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with his wives. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to go out on a journey, he would cast lots between his wives and the one whose name was drawn, he would take her with him.</p>\n<p>Narrated by al-Bukhari (2454) and Muslim (2770).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This shows that if a man wants to travel with one of his wives, he should cast lots between them. In our view this casting lots is obligatory.\"(Sharh Muslim&nbsp; 15/210).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for him to choose one of his wives to travel with him except by drawing lots.\"(Al-Muhalla 9/212).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Something similar was said by al-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in al-Sayl al-Jiraar (2/304).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he comes back from his trip, he should not count the period of his trip for the wife who travelled with him as the result of drawing lots. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When he comes back from his journey, he should resume the division of his time among them, and he should not count the days of the one with whom he travelled. The hardship that the wife who accompanied him went through as the result of travelling is in return for the time she got to spend with him.\"(Al-Tamheed&nbsp; 19/266).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is assumed that one of his wives was not able to travel with him, it is pointless to include her in drawing lots, when she is unable to travel with him. In that case, lots should be drawn among those whose circumstances allow them to travel, and lots should not be drawn between those who are able and those who are not. But this is based on the assumption that this is the truth and not just an illusion or based on mistreatment of her, such as if she is sick or she has children and cannot leave them without someone to look after them, or she is not allowed to travel, and other such reasons, and it is not because he wants the other wife to travel with him and not the first one. Otherwise he is being unjust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this case he has to try to please both wives, even if it means making it up to the one who is not travelling by spending extra time with her when he comes back from his trip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Qurtubi said: That varies according to women’s situations, and the prescription of drawing lots applies only if their situations are the same, lest one of them go out with him without a reason to make him take her and not the other(s).\"(Fath al-Bari&nbsp; 9/311).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Ahmad al-Rayyaan said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the wives’ situations are the same in all aspects, then drawing lots is a must. But if his wives differ in that, there is nothing wrong with choosing, so long as he pays attention to the principles of not favouring one of them and not aiming to cause harm.\"(Ta’addud al-Zawjaat&nbsp; p. 71).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We do not know of any site that deals specifically with issues of plural marriage.

      "question": "<p>How sound is the hadith narrated from Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him) in which he is reported to have said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha’baan and said: ‘O People, there has come to you a great and blessed month, a month in which there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Allah has made fasting (this month) an obligation and spending its nights in prayer an act of voluntary worship. Whoever draws near to Allah during this month by doing some good deeds is like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and the one who does an obligatory action during this month is like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other times. It is a month whose beginning is mercy, its middle is forgiveness and its end is ransom from the Fire…’”??</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>This hadith was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh, 3/191, no. 1887. He said, “If the report is saheeh …” but the word ‘if’ was omitted in some references such as al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb by al-Mundhiri (2/95), so they thought that Ibn Khuzaymah said, “The report is saheeh,” although he did not state that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also narrated by al-Mahaamili in al-Amaali (293); by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan (7/216); Fadaa’il al-Awqaat, p. 146, no. 37; by Abu’l-Shaykh Ibn Hibbaan in Kitaab al-Thawaab; it was attributed to him by al-Saa’aati in al-Fath al-Rabbaani (9/233); it was mentioned by al-Suyooti in al-Durr al-Manthoor, and he said, it was narrated by al-‘Aqeeli and he classed it as da’eef (weak); it was mentioned by al-Isbahaani in al-Targheeb, and by al-Munaqqi in Kanz al-‘Ummaal (8/477). All of them narrated it via Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib from Salmaan al-Faarisi. The isnaad of the hadith is da’eef (weak) for two reasons, which are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 – There is a break in the chain of narrators, because Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib did not hear it from Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>2 – Its isnaad includes ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’aan, of whom Ibn Sa’d said: “There is some weakness in him and he cannot be quoted as evidence. He was classed as da’eef (weak) by Ahmad, Ibn Ma’een, al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Khuzaymah, al-Jawzjaani and others, as it says in Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 5/207.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Haatim al-Raazi judged the hadith to be munkar (a kind of weak hadith). Al-‘Ayni said likewise in ‘Umdat al-Qaari’, 9/20, as did Shaykh al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah, vol. 2/262. no. 871. So it becomes clear that the isnaad of this hadith and similar reports are all da’eef (weak), and that the muhadditheen (scholars of hadith) judged it to be munkar, in addition to the fact that it contains some phrases whose authenticity is subject to further examination, such as its dividing the month into three parts, saying that the first ten days are mercy, then forgiveness, then ransom from the Fire. There is no evidence for this, rather the bounty of Allah is immense, all of Ramadan is mercy and forgiveness, and there are those whom Allah ransoms from the Fire every night and at the time of breaking the fast, as is proven by the ahaadeeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, in this hadith it says, “Whoever draws near to Allah during this month by doing some good deeds is like one who does an obligatory action.” There is no evidence for this, rather naafil actions are naafil and obligatory actions are obligatory in Ramadan and at other times. This hadith also says, “and the one who does an obligatory action during this month is like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other times.” This number is subject to further examination, because a good deed earns a reward between ten and seven hundred times in Ramadan and at other times, and nothing is exempted from that apart from fasting, for its reward is immense and unlimited, because of the hadith qudsi: “Every deed of the son of Adam is for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I shall reward for it.” (Agreed upon; narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We must beware of da’eef (weak) hadith and make sure of their status before we speak of them. We must strive to find out the saheeh ahaadeeth about the virtues of Ramadan. May Allah grant us all strength and accept our fasting, night prayers and all our good deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.&nbsp;</p>\n",

This invalidates wudu according to scholarly consensus…</p>\n<p>The second type is that which is rare, such as blood, worms, stones and hair. This also invalidates wudu. That is the view of ath-Thawri, ash-Shafa`i, Is-haq and as-hab ar-ra’y. ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, Abu Majlaz, al-Hakam, Hammadi, al-Awza`i, and Ibn al-Mubarak narrated that wudu is required if worms come out of the back passage, whereas Malik did not think that wudu was required for this type, because it is rare…</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Mughni</em>, 1/230.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah</em>, 17/112:</p>\n<p>That which comes out of the front and back passages rarely, such as worms, stones, hair, pieces of flesh and the like, is regarded as minor impurity which invalidates wudu according to the majority of jurists (the Hanafis, Shafa`is and Hanbalis). This is also the view of Ibn `Abd al-Hakam among the Malikis.</p>\n<p>This was also the view of ath-Thawri, Is-haq, ‘Ata’ and al-Hasan, because it comes out of the front or back passage, so it is akin to madhiy. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said in his <em>Ta`liqat `ala al-Kafi li Ibn Qudamah</em> (1/128):</p>\n<p>The correct view is that there is no difference between that which ordinarily occurs and that which rarely occurs. So if stones, worms, hair and the like come out of the back passage, it invalidates wudu. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “… unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.” If wind, which has no substance, invalidates wudu, then it is more appropriate to say that that which has substance also invalidates wudu. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Dubyan ad-Dubyan said: It seems that what matters is where it comes from, not whether it is impure or not, because wind is pure, but if it comes out of the back passage, it invalidates wudu, but if it comes out of the mouth (that is, burping), it does not invalidate wudu; what matters is not whether it is something that ordinarily happens or not, because wadiy is something that happens rarely and is not common, and it may be indicative of a health issue, yet despite that it invalidates wudu even according to the view of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him).</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Ahkam at-Taharah</em>, 10/631.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_it_obligatory_to_clean_oneself_istinja_if_worms_come_out_of_the_back_passage\"><strong>Is it obligatory to clean oneself (istinja’) if worms come out of the back passage? </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Although it is proven that if worms come out of the back passage, that invalidates wudu, it does not make it obligatory to clean oneself, because the reason for cleaning oneself (istinja’) is the presence of impurity, and the purpose behind cleaning oneself with water or pebbles is to remove substance of the impurity from the surface of the body.</p>\n<p>Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that cleaning oneself is not required if worms come out, except in the case where they contaminate the anus and the surrounding area with impurity. But if they do not contaminate the anus, then there is no requirement to clean oneself if they come out.</p>\n<p>It says in Hashiyat ad-Dasuqi (1/113), which is a book of Maliki jurisprudence:</p>\n<p>Similar to wind in the sense that there is no requirement to clean oneself are: stones and worms, if they come out free of moisture, or the amount of moisture is small.</p>\n<p>But if they come out with a great deal of moisture, then it is obligatory to clean oneself with water or pebbles, even if they do not invalidate wudu, as we shall see below. End quote.</p>\n<p>Ar-Rafi`i ash-Shafa`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If something comes out of the passage, it should be examined: if it is not contaminated [with impurity], such as worms or stones on which there is no moisture, then there are two scholarly views as to whether it is required to clean oneself. The more sound of the two views is that it is not required to clean oneself with either water or pebbles, because the purpose of cleaning oneself is to remove the impurity from that place or reduce it. So if the place is not contaminated and did not become impure, then there is no sense in trying to remove or reduce the impurity…</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Fat-h al-`Aziz</em>, 1/477.</p>\n<p>Al-Mardawi al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>With regard to impurity that does not cause contamination, there is no difference of scholarly opinion regarding the fact that it is obligatory to clean oneself of it. As for impurity that does not cause contamination and that which is pure, the correct view in our madhhab, which is also the view of the majority of our companions, is that it is obligatory to clean oneself of it.</p>\n<p>And it was said that there is no requirement to clean oneself of something pure that comes out, or something that is impure but it did not contaminate the place…</p>\n<p>By analogy, there is no obligation to clean oneself from that which comes out dry and does not contaminate the area. The same applies if what comes out is pure, such as maniy (semen), if we deem it to be pure, because cleaning oneself (istinja’) is only prescribed in order to remove impurity, and there is no impurity in this case. It says in <em>Al-Furu`</em>: This is more likely to be the correct view. It says in <em>Ar-Ri`ayah al-Kubra</em>: This is more correct based on analogy. I say: it is the correct view. How can someone clean himself with water or pebbles from something that is pure? Or how can he clean himself with pebbles from something that came out and did not cause any contamination? Does that make any sense?</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Al-Insaf</em>, 1/232-234.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>… There is no requirement to clean oneself of what is pure. Also exempted is that which does not cause contamination because it is dry. So if something comes out that does not cause contamination because it is dry, there is no requirement to clean oneself of it, because the purpose of cleaning oneself (istinja’) is to purify oneself, but in this case there is no need for that. But if something rare, such as a stone, comes out, is it obligatory to clean oneself?</p>\n<p>The answer to that is: if it causes contamination, then it is obligatory to clean oneself, because it comes under the general meaning of the author’s words. But if it does not cause contamination, there is no obligation to clean oneself because there is no need for that.</p>\n<p>End quote from <em>Ash-Sharh al-Mumti`</em>, 1/140-141.</p>\n<p>It says in <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em>, 4/116:</p>\n<p>If what comes out is something unusual, such as stones, worms or hair, there is no requirement to clean oneself of it if it comes out dry, whether it is regarded as pure or impure.</p>\n<p>But if it has some moisture and contaminates the place, then you must clean yourself of it, but if it does not contaminate the area, there is no need to clean oneself of it according to the Hanafis and Malikis; this is also the earlier view of both the Shafa`is and Hanbalis. End quote.</p>\n<p>Based on the above, what you mention about your feeling the worms come out even though you were not able to see them means that there is no requirement to clean yourself, because in this case only two scenarios may apply:</p>\n<p>Either your feeling that was not correct; rather it was only an itch or some sensation in that place, and no attention is to be paid to such things.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/89888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">89888</a>.</p>\n<p>Or you were not able to see them because they are very small. In that case it cannot be imagined that it would contaminate the place where it came out, and it would not leave behind any contamination that could be seen, so there is no requirement to clean oneself of it because there is no proof that any impurity is present.</p>\n<p>But we should point out that what matters is not looking at the worms that come out; rather you should look at the place and see whether there is any contamination from the worms in the first place. This is something that you can find out and determine, even if it is by wiping the area with a tissue and the like, if you are not sure whether there is any contamination.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
