      "title": "Is Black Friday Prohibited in Islam?",
      "question": "<p>What is the ruling on what is called Black Friday? Is it permissible to call it by this name? Is that regarded as imitating the disbelievers? Or is it regarded as being prohibited merely because it gives the majority of people an excuse to spend extravagantly and squander money? In other words, is it prohibited on the grounds of warding off mischief? Is buying and selling on that day prohibited?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<div id=\"toc_container\" class=\"no_bullets\">\n<p class=\"toc_title\">Table Of Contents</p>\n<ul class=\"toc_list\">\n<li><a href=\"#What_is_Black_Friday\">What is Black Friday?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Why_is_it_called_Black_Friday\">Why is it called Black Friday?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Ruling_on_taking_advantage_of_reduced_prices_on_Black_Friday\">Ruling on taking advantage of reduced prices on Black Friday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Can_Muslim_shopkeepers_single_out_Black_Friday_for_lowering_prices\">Can Muslim shopkeepers single out Black Friday for lowering prices?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3><span id=\"What_is_Black_Friday\"><strong>What is Black Friday?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“Black Friday is the last Friday of November. What we have found out about it is the following:</p>\n<p>Black Friday, which in the Arab world is sometimes called White Friday, is the day that comes immediately after Thanksgiving in the United States, and it is usually at the end of November every year. This day is regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.</p>\n<p>On this day, most stores offer sales and discounts, and open their doors as early as 4 AM, because of the huge discounts, and because most Christmas gifts are bought on that day. Large numbers of consumers gather outside major stores early on Friday, waiting for them to open, and when they open the crowds start pushing and shoving and running, each of them eager to acquire the biggest share of cut-price goods.</p>\n<p>The name of Black Friday dates back to the nineteenth century, as it was connected to the financial crisis of 1869 in the United States, which dealt a heavy blow to the American economy, to the extent that goods could not be sold and the buying and selling of goods ceased, which caused an economic catastrophe in America, from which it recovered by taking numerous measures, such as huge discounts in prices of products and goods, so that they could be sold instead of vendors being stuck with them, and so as to reduce losses as much as possible.</p>\n<p>From that day, it became a tradition in America for major stores, businesses and agencies to offer large discounts on their goods, that could be as high as 90% of their value, so that they could go back to their original price at the end of Black Friday or the month in which it occurs.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Why_is_it_called_Black_Friday\"><strong>Why is it called Black Friday?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>As for describing this day as ‘black’, that does not stem from dislike or superstition. Rather it was given this name for the first time in 1960 by the police in the city of Philadelphia, who gave it this name because of huge traffic jams, crowds and long lines in front of stores on this day, which was known for shopping. So the police department in Philadelphia dubbed this day Black Friday to describe the crowded chaos and traffic, both pedestrians and cars.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the word black is widely used with a specific meaning in the fields of business and accounting, as it is an indicator of profit and getting rid of stock in warehouses, whilst the colour red is indicative of loss and expenditure that exceeds earnings, or the piling up of trade goods and slowdown of business. The most likely reason [why it is called Black Friday] is that black ink was used to record profits and red ink was used to record losses in American ledgers and daily records of profits and losses. As a result of making large profits on that day, the ledgers were filled with black ink, then that Friday became known as Black Friday.” (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia-Black Friday</a>)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ruling_on_taking_advantage_of_reduced_prices_on_Black_Friday\"><strong>Ruling on taking advantage of reduced prices on Black Friday</strong></span></h3>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with buying items on Black Friday and taking advantage of the discounts and deals that are offered, even if this is connected to Thanksgiving or follows it, or these discounts are offered for people to buy Christmas gifts, so long as the purchaser buys permissible things and does not buy things for the purpose of celebrating Christmas, such as gifts and other things.</p>\n<p>In the answer to question no.&nbsp;<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/145676\" target=\"_blank\">145676</a> &nbsp;we explained that it is permissible to buy goods during the Christmas season, to take advantage of reductions in prices.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_Muslim_shopkeepers_single_out_Black_Friday_for_lowering_prices\"><strong>Can Muslim shopkeepers single out Black Friday for lowering prices?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>There is no such thing as Black Friday or White Friday for us. The Muslim should avoid <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/45200\" target=\"_blank\">imitating and resembling the disbelievers</a> , and he should beware of extravagance and squandering. Sales and deals should not prompt him to waste his money on things that he does not need.</p>\n<p>Owners of shops should not single out Black Friday for reducing prices, because of what it involves <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/121554\" target=\"_blank\">imitating and resembling the disbelievers</a> . Rather he should treat this day like any other day, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in&nbsp;Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud.)</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade resembling the disbelievers in customary matters, as Muslim (2077) narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw me wearing two garments that had been dyed with safflower and he said: “These are garments of the disbelievers; do not wear them.”</p>\n<p>And it was narrated from Hudhayfah ibn Al-Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him): I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Do not wear silk or brocade, do not drink from vessels of gold or silver, and do not eat from plates made with the same, for they are for them in this world and for us in the hereafter.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5426 and Muslim, 2967)</p>\n<p>Ahmad (22283) narrated that Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came out to some old men of the Ansar whose beards were white, and said: “O Ansar, dye your beards red and yellow; be different from the People of the Book.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, the People of the Book wear trousers and they do not wear the Izar (waist wrapper, lower garment). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Wear trousers and Izars, and be different from the People of the Book.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, the People of the Book wear Khuffs and do not wear sandals. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Wear Khuffs and sandals, and be different from the People of the Book.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, the People of the Book cut short their beards and let their moustaches grow. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Trim your moustaches and let your beards grow, and be different from the People of the Book.”</p>\n<p>At-Tirmidhi (2659) narrated from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb (may Allah be pleased with him), from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who imitates people other than us. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/21694\" target=\"_blank\">Do not imitate the Jews or the Christians</a> , for the greeting of the Jews is to gesture with the fingers and the greeting of the Christians is to gesture with the palm of the hand.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani)</p>\n<p>If the disbelievers look forward to Black Friday every year, and <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/7842\" target=\"_blank\">they single it out for discounts</a> and adverts and call it by a special name, we have no right to imitate them in that when we are buying and selling, or to single out this day for reducing prices on goods in our stores. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/22862\" target=\"_blank\">However, if a shopper comes across these discounts</a> , he may buy whatever he needs, as explained above.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>What the Muslim must do is be a good example of trustworthiness, fulfilling covwnants and good attitude. The fact that Muslims had these qualities was a cause of many kuffaar entering Islam when they saw the beauties of Islam and the good attitude and conduct of its people.</p>\n<p>Treachery and betrayal are forbidden in Islam, whether that is with a Muslim or a kaafir. What the Muslim is required to do is to respect the covenant between him and the country where he is or to which he has travelled, even if it is a kaafir country. The fact that it is a kaafir country does not make it permissible to betray it and consume its wealth unlawfully.</p>\n<p>So long as that country has granted safety to the Muslim who entered it, and it is giving him protection and protecting his wealth, then he is required to be honest towards that country, and it is not permissible for him to betray it or cheat it.</p>\n<p>Based on that, that country is within its rights to admit whomever it wants and refuse whomever it wants. If any Muslim enters that land, it is not permissible for him to deceive them or cheat them, whether that is done to the state itself or to its citizens, institutions or companies. He does not have the right to insist that they admit his family into their country or grant him permanent residency.</p>\n<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>As for betraying them, it is haraam, because they only granted him safety on condition that he refrain from betraying them and that he protect them from himself (i.e., harm caused by him). Even if that is not mentioned in so many words, it is implied and understood. End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>It is not permissible to take the wealth of a kaafir, when they have trusted one, by dishonest means, because people may travel together on the basis of trust, and trusts must be rendered back to their people whether they are Muslims or kaafirs.

Abu Dawud (2278) narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “The <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/93845\" target=\"_blank\">maternal aunt</a> is of the same status as the mother.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was said that what is meant is that she is of the same status as the mother with regard to being entitled to custody, because the hadith was narrated concerning that.&nbsp;(Fath al-Bari, 7 /506)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was also said that her status is equivalent to that of the mother with regard to custody and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adh-Dhahabi said in al-Kabair: “That is, with regard to showing kindness, honouring, and upholding ties of kinship with her.” (Sharh Bulugh al-Maram by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 5/203)&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rights_of_maternal_aunt_in_Islam\">Rights of maternal aunt in Islam</span></h3>\n<p>The second meaning is supported by the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1904) from Ibn ‘Umar, according to which a man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I have committed a grave sin; can I repent? He said: “Do you have a mother?” He said: No. He said: “Do you have a maternal aunt?” He said: Yes. He said: “Then treat her kindly.”&nbsp;(Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Targhib, 2504) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates that honouring one’s maternal aunt and treating her kindly come under the heading of virtuous deeds and acts that expiate sins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abu Dawud (4970) narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: O Messenger of Allah, all my friends have a kunyah. He said: “Call yourself by the name of your son ‘Abdullah” – meaning the son of her sister. Musaddad said: ‘Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr. He said: So she was known by the kunyah of Umm ‘Abdullah. He was ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, the son of her sister Asma (may Allah be pleased with them all).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This hadith confirms what is mentioned above, that the maternal aunt is of the same status as the mother.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the Muslim should treat his maternal aunt in a kind manner, just as he treats his mother.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_your_maternal_aunt_the_maternal_aunt_of_your_descendants\">Is your maternal aunt the maternal aunt of your descendants?</span></h3>\n<p>A <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/34791\" target=\"_blank\">person’s maternal aunt</a> – or his paternal aunt – is a maternal aunt to him and to all of his descendants, or a paternal aunt to him and all of his descendants. So your father’s paternal aunt is a paternal aunt to you, and your father’s maternal aunt is a maternal aunt to you; the same applies to your mother’s paternal aunt and maternal aunt.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_your_maternal_aunt_a_mahram\">Is your maternal aunt a mahram?</span></h3>\n<p>A man’s maternal aunt is one of his <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/43480\" target=\"_blank\">mahrams</a> , so it is permissible for him to shake hands with her, be alone with her and travel with her, and it is permissible for her to uncover her face in front of him, as a mother does in front of her sons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover in front of her mahrams and women like her that which usually is the case with people of religious commitment and good conduct, such as the face, head, neck, forearms and part of the shin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for her to wear short or see-through clothes in front of them, or tight clothes that show the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/82994\" target=\"_blank\">shape of the ‘awrah</a> .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

If you are not travelling, then when you have done the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’, join the imam in Tarawih. It does not matter if the intentions of the imam and of the person praying behind him are different; in other words, it is permissible for the imam to intend to offer an optional prayer and for the person praying behind him to intend to offer the obligatory prayer. This is what was stated by Imam Ahmad, that it is permissible for a person to pray `Isha’ behind someone who is praying Tarawih. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` `ala Zad Al-Mustaqni`, 4/66).</p>\n<p>But what he prays – in both cases – is not regarded as coming under the heading of praying Qiyam [voluntary prayers at night], because Tarawih prayer is separate in and of itself, and cannot be put together with the Sunnah of `Isha’ with one intention – and this applies even more so to the obligatory prayer – rather he should intend to pray the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’ on its own, and his Qiyam will be lacking those two Rak`ahs.</p>\n<p>Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>The Sunnah prayer of `Isha’ is a confirmed Sunnah, and is two Rak`ahs. The Sunnah is to offer this prayer before Tarawih, because it is a separate Sunnah, and Tarawih is a separate Sunnah. (End quote from Fatawa As-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 30/56)</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Practical_Solutions_for_Offering_the_Sunnah_Prayer\">Practical Solutions for Offering the Sunnah Prayer</span></h3>\n<p>In order to attain the virtue of all of them, he should speak to the Imam and ask him to wait, after the obligatory prayer of `Isha’, so that the worshippers can recite Tasbih and Dhikr, and offer the <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/175137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sunnah prayer</a> , then he can begin the Tarawih prayer.</p>\n<p>If the Imam refuses to do that, or if the time is too short and it is not possible to offer the Sunnah prayer within that time, then there he has the choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either he can delay the Sunnah prayer until after Tarawih, so long as that is not after half way through the night, because that is when the time for `Isha’ and its Sunnah prayers ends;</li>\n<li>Or he can offer the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’ in between the Rak`ahs of Tarawih, during the time when the worshippers have a rest, or when a short talk is given. This is not included in the advice that some scholars give that it is not allowed to offer optional prayer in the break in Tarawih, because this prayer is a regular Sunnah and is not optional in an absolute, unqualified sense.</li>\n<li>Or he may pray the first two Rak`ahs of Tarawih with the intention of praying the Sunnah prayer of `Isha’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See these answers for more information: (<a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/128164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">128164</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/37829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">37829</a>, <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/189426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">189426</a>)</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Is it permissible to give items as zakah instead of cash?",
      "question": "<p>Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us the eight categories of people to whom zakah may be given in His holy Book. Are the following activities regarded as coming under the categories of zakah: distributing food hampers, distributing blankets in the winter, hooking up water supply to the houses of poor people, building wooden roofs for them, providing trousseaux for brides who are orphans or poor, and providing medical aid for the sick – on condition that the zakah funds are given to a trustworthy charity, and the charity takes charge of these activities? Please note that the charity checks up on cases before offering the help to them. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good, as to whether the things mentioned above come under the categories of zakah or not. If I give zakah in this manner, will I have given it in the form of wealth as is required of me? Or is giving the zakah on one’s wealth in the form of money not obligatory at all?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is required in the case of zakah on one’s wealth is that it should be given in the form of money, and it is not permissible to give it in the form of items or food. It is obligatory for the one who is giving zakah to hand over the zakah money to those who are entitled to it, but after that he does not have any say in how the poor person is to dispose of this money or to tell him how to spend it in the was that will bring him most benefit according to his view; rather he should give the money to a poor person who is deserving of it and who knows better what he needs and what is in his best interests than anyone else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well-known that the person can get what he wants by means of money, unlike specific items that he may or may not need, and he may be compelled to sell it for a cheap price in order to make use of its price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>\n<p>Is it permissible to turn the zakah money into specific items, such as food or other things, and distribute it to the poor?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He replied:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That is not permissible; zakah must be given in cash.</p>\n<p>End quote from al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri (41/12)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He also said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>zakah on money must be given in cash; it cannot be given in the form of other items, unless the poor person made a request of you and said: If you receive money for me, then buy me such and such with it. In that case there is nothing wrong with it. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Majmoo‘ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/303)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If there is a specific poor person who needs either medicine or food, or similar needs, and it is known that if zakah is given to him in the form of cash it will clearly be detrimental, or if his interests dictate that that poor person should not be given cash, then in this case some of the scholars regard it as permissible to give him zakah in the form of specific items instead of cash. For example, if the poor person is insane or feebleminded, and does not handle money well, or he is foolish and will waste money, or he is an evildoer who will spend the money on that which is of no benefit, then he and his dependents will remain in need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh al-Islam said:</p>\n<p>Giving items of equivalent value when there is no need and no obvious interest to be served is not allowed… Because if it were made permissible to give items of equivalent value, then the giver may give bad quality items or the evaluation may not be correct. zakah is intended to help the poor, and the zakah is connected to the amount of wealth one owns and its type. However, with regard to giving items of equivalent value when there is a need for that or an interest to be served thereby, or to achieve fairness, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (25/82)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn Baz said in al-Fatawa (14/253):</p>\n<p>It is permissible to give, instead of cash, goods such as fabric, food and the like, if it is thought that the interests of the recipients of zakah may be best served in that manner, so long as what is given is evaluated correctly. For example, if the poor person is insane, feebleminded, foolish or immature, and there is the fear that he may mess about with the cash, and his interests are best served by giving him food or clothing equal in value to the amount of money due to him, bought with zakah funds, that he can benefit from. All of this is according to the most correct scholarly opinion. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Better than that is to buy on behalf of the poor (with their consent) the things that they need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Muhammad as-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>\n<p>If the people of this household are poor, but if we give them cash they will mishandle it by buying luxuries and things that are of no benefit, then if we buy necessities for them and give them to them, is that permissible?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The well-known view among the scholars is that this is not permissible, i.e. it is not permissible for the individual to buy items with his zakah and give them instead of cash. They said: That is because this cash is more beneficial to the poor, because they can spend the cash however they wish, unlike specific items for which they may have no need, in which case they would sell them for a lower price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there is an alternative: if you are afraid that if you give zakah to this household they will spend it on things that are not necessary, then you may say to the head of the household – whether that is the father or the mother or the brother or the paternal uncle – you can say to him: I have zakah to give; what items do you need so that I can buy them for you and send them to you?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you do it in this way, then it is permissible, and the zakah will be given appropriately.</p>\n<p>End quote from Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/question no. 643)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conclusion: giving zakah in the form of items and goods instead of cash is not permissible, unless there is a need for that and an interest to be served thereby.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The limits on a man’s lying to his wife and vice versa",
      "question": "<p>I know that lying is permissible in three situations: lying to one’s wife, lying for the purpose of bringing about reconciliation, and lying to the enemy (in war). Isn’t that so? But what are the limits on a man’s lying to his wife?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>There is a concession allowing one to tell lies in three situations, as is mentioned in the hadith narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1939) and Abu Dawud (4921) from Asma’ bint Yazid (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Lying is not permitted except in three cases: a man’s speaking to his wife to make her happy; lying at times of war; and lying in order to reconcile between people.” Al-Albani classed the hadith as authentic in <em>Sahih at-Tirmidhi</em>.</p>\n<p>Muslim (2065) narrated from Umm Kulthum bint `Uqbah ibn Abu Mu`ayt (may Allah be pleased with her) that she heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saying: “He is not a liar who reconciles between people and conveys something good or says something good.” Ibn Shihab said: I did not hear of any concession being granted concerning anything that people call lies except in three cases: War, reconciling among people, and what a man says to his wife or a woman says to her husband.</p>\n<p>What is meant by telling lies between spouses is lying when expressing affection and love for the purpose of maintaining harmony and keeping the family together, such as the husband saying to his wife: You are dear to me, or: No one is dearer to me than you, or: You are the most beautiful of women in my eyes, and so on. It does not mean the kind of lying that leads to undermining rights or evasion of duties and so on.</p>\n<p>Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Sharh as-Sunnah</em> (13/119): Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi said: These are issues in which a man may have to exaggerate in his words and go beyond what is strictly true, for the purpose of maintaining peace and warding off harm. A similar concession is granted in some situations, allowing something that is wrong for the sake of some hoped-for benefit. So lying when seeking to reconcile between two people means telling one of them that the other said something good about him, even if he did not hear him say that, intending thereby to bring about reconciliation. And lying in the case of war means pretending to be strong, and saying things that will encourage and inspire one’s companions and cause trouble to the enemy. It is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “War is deceit.”</p>\n<p>What is meant by a man’s lying to his wife is making promises to her and raising her hopes, and showing more love to her than he really feels, in order to maintain a good relationship with her and make her behave well with him. And Allah knows best.</p>\n<p>Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah said: If a man apologizes to another man, saying nice things that are not accurate in order to please him, he is not a liar who is distorting the facts: “He is not a liar who reconciles between people.” He said: His reconciling between himself and another man is more important than his reconciling between people.</p>\n<p>It was narrated that at the time of `Umar, a man said to his wife: I adjure you by Allah, do you love me? She said: As you have adjured me by Allah, then no. He went to `Umar, who sent for her and said: Are you the one who said to your husband: I do not love you? She said: O Amir al-Mu’minin, he adjured me by Allah; should I lie to him? He said: Yes, you should lie to him; not all marriages are built on love, but people get along by virtue of Islam and ties of kinship. End quote.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Sharh Muslim</em>: As for a man’s lying to his wife and her lying to him, what is meant is showing affection, making promises that are not binding, and so on. As for tricking one another in order to withhold their dues, or take that to which they have no right, that is prohibited according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. And Allah knows best. End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Al-Fat-h</em>: [The scholars] are unanimously agreed that what is meant by lying with regard to a wife and husband is lying in matters that do not lead to waiving of duties or acquiring that to which he or she has no right. End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <em>Sharh Riyadh as-Salihin</em> (1/1790): Serving an interest also includes a man’s talking to his wife and a woman’s talking to her husband in ways that increase harmony and strengthen the bond between them, such as if he says to her: You are dear to me, you are dearer to me than all women, and the like, even if he is lying, but it is for the sake of creating affection, and it serves an interest. End quote.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Will the Sunnah of the `aqiqah be fulfilled by slaughtering one sheep for a boy?",
      "question": "<p>Allah has blessed me with a boy, who is now two years old, but I did not offer `aqiqah for him. Now Allah has blessed me with another boy, and I want to offer `aqiqah for both boys. If I slaughter one sheep for each boy, will I have fulfilled the Sunnah, or must I offer teo sheep for each boy in order to fulfil the Sunnah? If I slaughter one sheep for each boy now, can I slaughter one sheep for each boy later on, so that two sheep will have been slaughtered for each boy? I hope to do that when my situation becomes easier, by Allah’s grace. Or is the best and correct thing to slaughter two sheep on behalf of one of them now, and not offer `aqiqah for the other until things become easier, by Allah’s grace? What is the difference between what is good enough and fulfilling the Sunnah?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>Offering the `aqiqah is a confirmed Sunnah, but there is no sin one the one who does not do it, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (2842) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: &nbsp;“If anyone has a child born to him and wishes to offer a sacrifice on its behalf, he may offer two sheep of similar type for a boy and one for a girl.” Shaykh al-Albani classed it as authentic (hasan) in <em>Sahih Abi Dawud</em>.</p>\n<p>Thus the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) connected the matter to what the individual wanted to do; this indicates that it is recommended (mustahabb), but not obligatory. See: <em>Tuhfat al-Mawdud</em>, p. 157.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>The Sunnah is to offer two sheep on behalf of a male child and one sheep on behalf of a female, because of the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1516) and an-Nasa’i (4217) from Umm Karaz, according to which she asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about the `aqiqah, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On behalf of a boy two sheep and on behalf of a girl one sheep.” Classed as authentic by al-Albani in&nbsp;<em>Irwa’ al-Ghalil</em>, 4/391.</p>\n<p>Ash-Shirazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Sunnah is to sacrifice two sheep on behalf of a boy and one sheep on behalf of a girl, because of the report narrated by Umm Karaz… and because and because the purpose is to express joy at the birth of the child, and the joy at the birth of a boy is greater, so the sacrifice offered on his behalf is greater. But if one sheep is slaughtered on behalf of each of them, that is permissible, because of the report narrated by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sacrificed one ram each on behalf of al-Hasan and al-Husayn (peace be upon them)… End quote.</p>\n<p>An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: The Sunnah is to sacrifice two sheep on behalf of a boy and one sheep on behalf of a girl, but if a person slaughters one sheep on behalf of a boy, then he has fulfilled the basic requirement of the Sunnah, because of what the author mentioned.(<em>Sharh al-Muhadhdhab</em>, 8/409).</p>\n<p>In <em>Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah</em> (30/280), it says: The Shafa`is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is recommended to offer as `aqiqah for a male two sheep of similar type, and for a female one sheep, because of the hadith of `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in which she said that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed them to offer two sheep of similar type for a boy and one sheep for a girl.</p>\n<p>It is permissible to offer one sheep as `aqiqah for a boy, because of the hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>\n<p>The Hanafis and Malikis are of the view that one sheep each may be offered as `aqiqah for a boy and a girl. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to do that… End quote.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person can only afford one sheep, that is sufficient and fulfils the purpose. But if Allah has made him well off, then two sheep is better.(<em>Ash-Sharh al-Mumti`</em>, 7/492).</p>\n<p>Thirdly:</p>\n<p>Once it has become clear that the basic requirement of Sunnah may be fulfilled by slaughtering one sheep on behalf of a boy, then if someone has two boys, for example, and he only has two sheep, then what is more appropriate to suggest is that he should slaughter one sheep on behalf of each boy, and thus he will have fulfilled the basic requirement of the Sunnah, and done as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did. Missing out on what is best for each of them is less serious than missing out on the basic requirement of the Sunnah for one of them, especially as some of the scholars say that offering the `aqiqah is obligatory. So discharging one’s duty with regard to the `aqiqah for two boys is more appropriate than discharging it for one of them, and leaving the other unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that: he offered one sheep each as `aqiqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn.</p>\n<p>Then if a person becomes better off after that, and he wants to offer another sheep in addition to the one that he had already slaughtered, then we hope that that will benefit him, in sha Allah, and that this will perfect the `aqiqah that he had previously offered.</p>\n<p>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: If he slaughters one sheep today, and he slaughters the second a few days later, there is nothing wrong with that, and it is not essential that the two sheep should both be slaughtered at the same time.(<em>Al-Muntawa min Fatawa al-Fawzan)</em>.</p>\n<p>Fourthly:</p>\n<p>The difference between doing what is sufficient and doing something as prescribed in the Sunnah is that there is more goodness in doing it as prescribed in the Sunnah than in doing what is merely sufficient. An example is if a person does wudu’ and washes each part once; his wudu’ is valid and he does not have to repeat it, but if he washes each part three times, then he will have done what is sufficient and will also have a great reward for doing what is in accordance with the&nbsp; Sunnah. Another example is someone who fasts on the tenth day of Muharram but does not fast a day before or a day after. His deed is acceptable and he will be rewarded for it, but he is not like one who fasts one day before or after, for the latter will have done what is sufficient and more, by acting in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who encouraged us to fast a day before or a day after.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",
