      "title": "Should a  menstruating woman do ghusl after sexual contact?",
      "question": "<p>If I give sexual pleasure to my husband while I have my menses, do I need to take a ritual bath to purify myself even if I don't pray (because of my menses)?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>A menstruating woman does not need to do ghusl after having sexual contact, because her impurity lasts as long as the blood is flowing, and it does not stop until her bleeding stops and she does ghusl. While she is menstruating, her husband is not permitted to have intercourse in the vagina, because of the aayah (interpretation if the meaning): They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: That is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them until they have purified (from menses and taken a bath) [al-Baqarah 2:222]. The husband may enjoy (sexual activity) other than intercourse, because of the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that among the Jews, when a woman had her menses they would not eat with her or stay in the same house with her. The Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked him about this, and Allaah revealed the aayah, They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: That is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses [al-Baqarah 2:222]. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Do everything except have intercourse. News of this reached the Jews, and they said, What does this man want? He doesnt leave anything of ours alone without saying something different!</p>\n<p>(Reported by Muslim, 455). And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "It is Sunnah to make the animal face the qiblah at the time of slaughter",
      "question": "<p>If a man wants to slaughter a chicken, does he have to make it face toward the qiblah or may he slaughter it no matter what direction it is facing?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>The Sunnah with regard to     slaughter is to make the animal face towards the qiblah, but that is not     obligatory. If he slaughters it facing any other direction, his slaughter is     halaal, but he has omitted a Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ahmad (15022), Abu Dawood     (2785) and Ibn Maajah (3121) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allah     be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of     Allah be upon him) sacrificed two rams on the day of Eid. When he turned     them to face towards the qiblah he said: “Verily, I have turned my face     towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth Haneefa (Islamic     Monotheism, i.e. worshipping none but Allaah Alone), and I am not of     Al-Mushrikoon .Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my     dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that     exists). He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the     first of the Muslims’ [cf. al-An’aam 6:79, 162-163]. O Allaah, from You and     to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his ummah. In the name of Allah and Allah     is most great.” Then he slaughtered them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The isnaad of this hadeeth     may reach the level of hasan as Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot said in Tahqeeq al-Musnad.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in al-Mawsoo’ah     al-Fiqhiyyah (21/196), explaining the etiquette of slaughtering:</p>\n<p>The slaughterer should face     towards the qiblah and the animal’s neck should be turned to face the     qiblah, because Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) disliked eating     the meat of any animal that had been slaughtered facing any direction other     than the qiblah, and no one among the Sahaabah disagreed with him. That is     narrated in some reports from Ibn Sireen and Jaabir ibn Zayd. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See: al-Mughni,     3/221&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It says in Fataawa     al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (22/477) concerning one who slaughters an animal     facing a direction other than the qiblah and claims that making it face the     qiblah applies only when slaughtering the hadiy:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the situation with     regard to slaughter is as you say, then the slaughter is sound and valid in     terms of it being halaal, but the slaughterer is going against the Sunnah by     not turning to face the qiblah with the animal at the time of slaughter, and     he is doing wrong by not accepting the advice, and he is mistaken in his     claim that making it face the qiblah applies only when slaughtering the     hadiy, because the Sunnah is to turn towards the qiblah with the animal at     the time of slaughter in all cases, whether it is a hadiy or a sacrifice or     otherwise. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It also says (1/67): It is     mustahabb for the slaughterer to face towards the qiblah&nbsp; and to make the     animal also face towards the qiblah, because it is the noblest of     directions, and because turning to face the qiblah is mustahabb in acts of     worship, except in cases where there is evidence to indicate otherwise. The     fact that this is mustahabb is particularly emphasized if it is a hadiy or     udhiyah. It is narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that     the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “Offer your     sacrifices and be of good cheer, for there is no Muslim who turns his     sacrifice to face the qiblah but its blood and dung and wool will be     hasanaat that are present on his scales on the Day of Resurrection.” And he     used to say: “Spend a little, you will be rewarded a great deal.” This     hadeeth was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf, and     al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and al-Bayhaqi narrated something similar. Although     the imams of hadeeth suggested that its isnaad is weak, it may be acted upon     with regard to encouraging good deeds. Hence Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn Sireen     regarded it as makrooh to eat meat that was not facing the qiblah at the     time of slaughter. Limiting oneself to saying Bismillaah and letting the     animal face any direction at the time of slaughter is forsaking that which     is better, but the slaughter is still valid. This was the view of al-Qaasim     ibn Muhammad, al-Nakha’i, al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mundhir and others. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",

      "question": "<p>I have a question about platforms for financing through loans, some of which are in accordance with Islamic rulings, such as the Digital platform and the Lendo platform, based on the view of the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB) in Bahrain, which includes Drs. Al-Muzayni, ash-Shalhoob and al-Qarri. My question is: is the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB) a reliable source for shar‘i verdicts, or not?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>After checking the website for the Lendo platform, we did not find any details on how they operate, but based on what we did see, we may note the following two points:</p>\n<p>1.. The platform buys invoices that are owed by the company that is requesting financing, but there are no details on the website about how that is done, but the basic principle is that buying debts is haraam.</p>\n<p>2.. The platform goes and buys whatever product the investor wants, then sells it on credit to the company that is requesting financing, then they sell it on behalf of that company to another trader, so that the company in question can obtain cash.</p>\n<p>This comes under the heading of organized tawarruq, which is haraam. Statements on the prohibition of that have been issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Council and by the Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League.</p>\n<p>See the answer to question no. <a class=\"LinkFatwa\" href=\"/en/answers/98124\" target=\"_blank\">98124</a> .</p>\n<p>Having said this in brief, we cannot give a verdict on what the Lendo platform does, or what the Digital platform does.</p>\n<p>We have no information on the standards of the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB). However, it is known that some shari‘ah committees may regard some things as permissible that others regard as prohibited, such as organized tawarruq, mixed shares, stipulating penalties for late payment, turning debt into something else, and so on.</p>\n<p>If you want our verdict on what platforms for financing through loans do, then give us details of the way in which they operate. One of the permissible ways is for the platform to sell items on credit to the company that is seeking financing, then the company can sell the items themselves in order to raise cash. This is the kind of tawarruq that is permissible.</p>\n<p>The company should not buy a product and give the invoice to the platform to finance it; rather it should make a profit-sharing contract (muraabahah) with the platform, so that the platform will purchase the product for itself, in a valid purchase, then sell it to the company by instalments.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Comments on the ban on the hijab and niqab in some countries, and the ruling on non-Muslim women being uncovered in Muslim countries",
      "question": "<p>It is well known what is happening now in France, and even in some Muslim countries, of opposition to hijab, which has become a focus of debate in some gatherings and TV shows, to such an extent that we now see some people saying: How can you ask others to give you freedom to wear the hijab in the manner you want when at the same time you are forcing them to wear hijab in your countries? It is the same thin. If you really think that forcing women to take off the niqab undermines personal freedom, then what you do here of forcing women to wear the abayah may also be regarded as undermining personal freedom. Do not be fanatical. You are not forced to live in their countries, but you have the right to migrate there, so keep quiet and accept their laws. I would like a convincing academic answer from you, as we are used to hearing from you concerning such matters. May Allah reward you with good for all that you have done and are doing, and may He benefit us by your knowledge, for indeed you are the best successors to the best predecessors. May Allah bless you.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Muslim who cares about his religion feels deeply hurt when he sees opposition to Islam and its symbols, not only from the disbelievers but even from Muslims who outwardly claim to belong to Islam. Among them are some who speak out of ignorance, and there are some who speak on the basis of evil and heresy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we compare the war on modesty and chastity in non-Muslim countries and some countries that claim to be Muslim, we will find that the enmity in the latter countries is more severe and greater, because they have promulgated laws that ban covering the head, whereas those non-Muslim countries – such as France and Belgium – have promulgated laws that ban covering the face only. There is a clear difference between the two matters. But the distress in the hearts of those who care about Islam was – and still is – due to a number of reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. These countries are supposedly Muslim, not Christian or Jewish</p>\n<p>2. They ban covering the head and punish people for doing so; they humiliate&nbsp; the chaste women who wear hijab, and prevent them from studying, working or seeking medical treatment.</p>\n<p>3. Their war on chastity and modesty is an old one; they were decades ahead of non-Muslim countries.</p>\n<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to the claim of some defeatists, that if we criticize the disbelievers for banning the niqab in the name of personal freedom, then how can we force their women to wear the abayah – or cover up – in our country, the answer to that is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. There is no country in the Muslim world that obliges non-Muslim women to cover their bodies when they go out in the street, except one country, namely Saudi Arabia. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to preserve this good and not let it change. As for the other Muslim countries, they do not oblige their own women to cover up, so how could they oblige non-Muslim women to do so?</p>\n<p>2. Wanton display and nakedness are not permissible for Christians and Jews according to the original teachings of their religions; the command to them to cover up is the original command in their religions.</p>\n<p>3. We do not criticise the disbelievers for banning face coverings for Muslim women, if their reasons for doing so stemmed from their religion. Rather we criticize them for several reasons, such as the following:</p>\n<p>a. they claim that they are secular and that they have separated church from state, so why are they fighting a religious symbol?</p>\n<p>b. They claim that they are protecting personal freedom, so why do they apply this to everyone who takes off her clothes or most of them, but they do not apply it to the one who covers her body or most of it?</p>\n<p>c. They are not fighting anything but Islam using the issue of how its women dress. These countries all have different types of clothing for both men and women, so why are the women of those religions and groups and sects left to dress as they wish, except Muslim women, who are being put under pressure with regard to something that is obligatory for them in their religion?</p>\n<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those who oblige non-Muslim women to wear the abaya and cover up may be asked: have you obliged the women of your own country to do so? They will answer yes. They may be asked: Do you differentiate between a non-Muslim woman of one religion and a non-Muslim woman of another religion? They will say: No, we do not differentiate. And finally they may be asked: Does your religion enjoin you to do this? Their answer will be: Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence no one should criticize those who rule according to secularism or anything else for allowing non-Muslim women to go uncovered in their own countries, but those who rule according to sharee‘ah should not be blamed or criticized either. Secularism allows non-Muslim women to go uncovered, but the religion of Islam does not allow that, so the former allows them to do that and the latter does not. Hence wise people directed their blame and criticism to non-Muslim countries because they rule according to secularism yet despite that they ban the covering of the face, even though their own principles do not allow them to do that, let alone criminalize the woman who covers her face or those among her family who called her to do that or instructed her to do that. If that is not dictatorship or fascism or terrorism, then what is?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is not permissible for anyone in a position of authority in any Muslim country to allow the uncovering of ‘awrahs or wanton display from anyone in his country. He is responsible for every sin that is committed in the area over which he has authority, even if it is committed by non-Muslims. There is to be no differentiation between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim woman with regard to preventing wanton displays or nakedness, just as there is no differentiation between them in terms of it being prohibited for men to look at them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the lessons learned from the hadeeth of Haatib:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ibn al-Munayyir said: There is nothing in the hadeeth to say whether the woman was a Muslim or a dhimmiyyah (from a non-Muslim people living under Muslim rule); but because the ruling on the prohibition of looking at her unnecessarily applies equally to both (i.e., both the Muslim woman and the non-Muslim woman), the evidence refers to both.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fath al-Baari (6/191).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was not a particular type of dress for non-Muslim women, because wanton displays and nakedness were not known among them; rather even the women during the Jaahiliyyah were not known to dress in indecent ways. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated clearly that he had not seen this type of people, when he said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen, men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, mumeelaat maa’ilaat walking with an enticing gait (or turning away from righteousness and leading others astray) with their heads like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor smell its fragrance, and its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.”</p>\n<p>Narrated by Muslim (2128) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even if we say that we respect personal freedom, preventing the non-Muslim woman from dressing indecently and making a wanton display is not contrary to that principle – even if we go along with it – unlike banning the Muslim woman from covering her head or face, because that ban is contrary to the principle of personal freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shaykh Mahmaas ibn Jal‘ood (may Allah preserve him) said:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For non-Muslim women to go out in the midst of a Muslim society with clothing that provokes desire and temptation should either be within the framework of civil laws or within the framework of personal rights; in both cases it is not permissible for non-Muslim women to be uncovered in Muslim society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Civil law is based on the obligation to respect the feelings of all people, and it is not permissible for anyone to provoke their feelings or desire, and cause pain to them. This manner of appearance of non-Muslim women in Muslim countries is offensive to people’s feelings and harmful to their spiritual wellbeing, whether the beholder is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. That is for two reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. If the one who sees those non-Muslim women dressing in a manner that is not chaste or decent is a Muslim, then he will see in that something which will provoke anger his this obvious violation of religious teaching and this kind ofconduct that is contrary to the rulings of Islam. If he is one of those who are weak in faith, he may feel sexually provoked which will cause him pain, embarrassment and hardship. No matter who he is, he is a sensitive human being, a man of flesh and blood, who is sensitive to what he sees and hears, and is affected by it whether in a positive or negative fashion.</p>\n<p>2. If we assume that the Muslims lower their gaze and do not look at this nakedness and indecent scenes, the male non-Muslims will feel provoked sexually, which may prompt them to commit crimes of various kinds in order to quench that desire, which they cannot find anything to quench or direct it in sound ways, because they are so far removed from faith and Islam</p>\n<p>In the case of civil laws that are based on Islamic sharee‘ah, it states that Muslims and ahl adh-dhimmah are equal in terms of outward moral duties, and no exception is made in that regard for the dhimmis apart from alcohol and pork. They may make and drink alcohol in private, so long as none of that or its harms affect the Muslims. And they may raise pigs, eat them and buy and sell them amongst themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This applies if we say that by not allowing the non-Muslim women to go out dressed improperly is in harmony with civil rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But if someone were to say that going out in whatever clothes she wants to wear is one of a woman’s personal rights, we say that despite the weakness of this view for reasons that we have mentioned above, we may add that the personal laws of the Jews and Christians are based on the Torah and the Gospel, despite the fact that they have been distorted, and there is nothing in the scriptures to suggest that these indecent kinds of dressing and this ignorant wanton display is permitted. Muslim societies deal with ahl adh-dhimmah in a manner that allows them to practice their religion with regard to personal matters, but with regard to that which is proven to be prohibited to them and to the Muslims, it is forbidden to all of them equally. The extant texts in the Gospel that speak of this matter instruct women to wear a face cover and mention different sizes thereof and the Torah also says that Rebekah wore a face veil because she was a respectable woman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Al-Muwaalaah wa’l-Mu‘aadaah fi ash-Sharee‘ah al-Islamiyyah (2/684-691); this is a lengthy chapter and we have quoted only part of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "answer": "<p>Firstly:</p>\n<p>With regard to opening an account in a riba-based bank, in principle, what is agreed upon is that what is prohibited in this regard is opening an account in a riba-based bank, depositing money in it, and taking the interest that is paid on it.</p>\n<p>As for simply opening an account in such banks without interest – whether one deposits money or not – this is a matter concerning which the scholars differed as to whether it is disallowed or permissible.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly it is more prudent, and more on the safe side, not to open any account in a riba-based bank, unless there is a need that dictates doing so.</p>\n<p>Among the needs which would make doing that permissible is the need to protect one’s money, or if a person is engaged in trade and his commercial interests will be adversely affected if he does not have accounts in such banks, or if his employer only pays salaries by depositing them in bank accounts, and he cannot receive it unless he opens a bank account, and other such genuine needs.</p>\n<p>A number of trustworthy scholars have stated that concessions are allowed in the case of such needs.</p>\n<p>Please see the answer to question no. <a href=\"/en/answers/226729\">226729</a>.</p>\n<p>Secondly:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to use debit cards to make withdrawals.</p>\n<p>As for credit cards, they are not permissible unless they are free of features concerning which there are reservations according to Islamic teachings.

If you can only refuse it by refraining from using the credit card for a while, then you must do that.</p>\n<p>It says in a statement of the International Islamic Fiqh Council no. 9/3/86, regarding bank accounts:</p>\n<p>After studying the research papers submitted to the Council on the topic of savings accounts, and after listening to the discussion that took place on this topic, and the discussion on current accounts, whether they are in Islamic banks or riba-based banks, [the Council determined that these accounts are to be regarded] from a shar‘i point of view as loans, because the bank becomes liable for the money deposited in these accounts, and is obligated according to shari‘ah to return the money upon request. The ruling that it constitutes a loan is not affected by the fact that the bank (the borrower) is very well off. End quote.</p>\n<p>Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh (3814) that Abu Burdah said: I came to Madinah and met ‘Abdullah ibn Salaam (may Allah be pleased with him). He said to me: You live in a land where riba is widely practised. If a man owes you something and he offers you a load of straw, or a load of barley, or a load of clover, do not accept it, for it is riba. Clover is a plant eaten by animals.</p>\n<p>Similar reports were narrated from a number of the Sahaabah.</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "The addition of the word “kareem” in the du‘aa’ of Laylat al-Qadr is not proven",
      "question": "<p>It is quoted in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him):<br />\n3513: Qutaybah told us: Ja‘far ibn Sulaymaan ad-Dab‘i told us, from Kahmas ibn al-Hasan, from ‘Abdullah ibn Buraydah, from ‘Aa’ishah, who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, if I realise when it is Laylat al-Qadr, what do you think I should say? He said: “Say: Allahumma innaka ‘Awfuwwun Kareem, tuhibb al-‘afwa, fa‘fu ‘anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and most generous, You love forgiveness, so forgive me).” The shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) deemed it to be saheeh. But the same hadith was narrated by Ibn Maajah (3850) and in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, Shaykh al-Albaani stated that the additional word “Kareem (most generous)” was added by one of the scribes. Did the shaykh fail to notice the additional word “kareem” in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi, or is it saheeh in his opinion? If it is not proven in his opinion, then why did he not point out in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi that it is something that has been added?</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) was a scholar and critic of hadith who examined the reports and tried his best in doing so, but he was vulnerable to forgetfulness and error, like other scholars, and that does not detract from his standing in the slightest; rather he will be rewarded for that, by Allah’s leave, receiving a single reward. That is by the grace and kindness of Allah, may He be exalted, to the scholars and fuqaha’; He grants them a single reward for their mistakes, and grants them a double reward for what they get right. What matters is that researchers and seekers of knowledge follow the correct methodology in research and do not follow blindly; the status of a scholar does not prevent them from reviewing the evidence and conducting their own research, for academic research should be objective and neutral, and should only be based on real research and examination, and it should not be restricted to some particular names of great scholars, no matter how well versed and prominent they may be.</p>\n<p>Therefore we may say that Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) failed to point out the erroneous addition of the word “kareem” in the hadith about the du‘aa’ of Laylat al-Qadr, as the hadith was narrated via many chains of narration, and it was narrated by the authors of Jaami‘s, Sunans and Musnads, and not one of them mentioned this extra word “kareem”; rather all of them narrated the well-known version of the du‘aa’: “Allahumma innaka ‘Awfuwwun, tuhibb al-‘afwa, fa‘fu ‘anni (O Allah, You are forgiving, You love forgiveness, so forgive me).”</p>\n<p>But this mistake occurred in al-Albaani’s book Saheeh at-Tirmidhi (no. 3513) only.</p>\n<p>With regard to his book Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah – concerning which researchers are agreed that the research that was put into it was more precise and deeper than that of his other books, Saheeh as-Sunan and Da‘eef as-Sunan – the shaykh pointed out this erroneous addition and said:</p>\n<p>In Sunan at-Tirmidhi after the word “ ‘Afuw” there appears this additional word “Kareem”, for which there is no basis in the earlier sources or any other sources that were narrated from the earlier sources. What appears to be the case is that it is something that was inserted by one of the scribes or modern typists. It does not appear in the Indian edition of Sunan at-Tirmidhi on which al-Mubaarakfoori’s commentary, Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (4/264), was based, or in other editions.</p>\n<p>What supports that is the fact that in some of his reports, an-Nasaa’i narrated it via the same isnaad as at-Tirmidhi, as both of them narrated it from their shaykh, Qutaybah ibn Sa‘eed, without this addition.</p>\n<p>This addition also appears in an essay by our brother ‘Ali al-Halabi, entitled Muhadhdhab ‘Amal al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah li Ibn as-Sunni (no. 202), but it is not narrated by as-Sunni, because he narrated from his shaykh, an-Nasaa’i – as stated above – from Qutaybah, but he attributed it to at-Tirmidhi and others. What would have been more appropriate is to put this word between brackets, as is the practice nowadays, to highlight the fact that it was only mentioned by at-Tirmidhi. To be accurate, however, this word should not be mentioned at all except to point out that it has no basis.</p>\n<p>End quote from Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (13/140).</p>\n<p>Hence some researchers regard al-Albaani’s comment here, in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah – as constituting a clear retraction of his having regarded this addition as sound in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, whether you call it retraction or a conclusion that is separate from the first conclusion, what matters is that he stated the correct view and corrected the mistake.</p>\n<p>What is most likely to be the case is that this extra word, with which people are familiar, was taken from some editions of the books of hadith, not from the reports of the hadith itself, meaning that the scholars who narrated the hadith with this extra word “kareem” only did so because they found some manuscripts that contained the extra word “kareem”, as the commentators said concerning the Mu’sasat ar-Risaalah edition of Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (42/236): In “Q” it says “ ‘Afuwwun kareem.” End quote. “Q” is a symbol referring to a particular manuscript to which they referred. See their Introduction (1/104). Similarly, with regard to the al-Maknaz edition (11/6118, no. 26021), the commentators said: In “Q” it says “ ‘Afuwwun kareem.”</p>\n<p>Hence many scholars transmitted the hadith with this additional word in their books, such as: Ibn al-Atheer in Jaami‘ al-Usool (4/324); al-‘Imraani in al-Bayaan fi’l-Madhhab ash-Shaafa‘i (3/568); al-Khaazin in Lubaab at-Ta’weel fi Ma‘aani at-Tanzeel (4/452); Ibn al-Qayyim in Badaa’i‘ al-Fawaa’id (2/143); al-Khateeb ash-Sharbeeni in al-Iqnaa‘ fi Hall Alfaaz Abi Shujaa‘ (1/274); al-Ameer as-San‘aani in at-Tahbeer li Eedaah Ma‘aani at-Tayseer (4/268); at-Tahtaawi in Haashiyat ‘ala Maraaqi al-Falaah Sharh Noor al-Eedaah (p. 401).</p>\n<p>All of them narrated the hadith with the additional word “kareem” and without mentioning any isnaad. Some of them attributed it to Sunan at-Tirmidhi. This is assuming that the manuscripts were copied accurately.</p>\n<p>But today we have no doubt that this additional word is not part of the original text of the hadith, because dozens of books of hadith mentioned the text of this hadith without this additional word. We referred to editions that were checked against many manuscripts of Sunan at-Tirmidhi, and we did not find any reference to this additional word, such as the edition annotated by Bashaar ‘Awaad (5/490), and another edition annotated by Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot (6/119).</p>\n<p>And Allah knows best.</p>\n",

      "title": "Taking interest to make up for loss of money’s real value",
      "question": "<p>Money looses its buying power as much as life becomes more expensive. For example, if life becomes 2% more expensive, the buying power of a 100 dinar today will be 102 in a year’s time. What is the ruling if I deal with a bank just to keep my money’s buying power, i.e. receive interest that just makes up the loss of my money’s purchasing value?.</p>\n",
      "answer": "<p>    Firstly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Undoubtedly the ever-rising cost of living means that keeping     money will cause it to lose some of its buying power. Hence you should look     for Islamically acceptable ways of investing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Based on the risks involved in investment and the loss of     trust in investment companies among many people, some of them have resorted     to putting their money in riba-based banks and taking interest. This stems     either from ignorance of the fact that this is haraam, or from preferring     this world over the Hereafter. Putting money in riba-based banks is gravely     haraam, because it is riba, for which the one who consumes it, the one who     pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it are all     cursed. It is the riba for which Allaah has issued a declaration of war and     divine wrath for the one who does it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains     (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.</p>\n<p>    279.&nbsp;And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war     from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital     sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you     shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:278-279]</p>\n<p>    Muslim (1598) narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased     with him)said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah     be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the     one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all     the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:     “A dirham of riba that a man consumes knowingly is worse before Allaah than     committing zina thirty-six times.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabaraani;     classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 3375.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    In fact depositing one’s money in these banks is a loan with     interest. The lender is the customer and the borrower is the bank, because a     loan means giving the money then taking something else in return. Calling     that a deposit (wadee’ah) is an obvious misnomer, because the wadee’ah is     kept as is and is not disposed of, such as putting money in a safety vault     box for example, where the money itself remains and does not change. But the     bank disposes of the money as one who owns it, with the commitment to back a     similar amount, and this is a loan. If it comes with a commitment to pay     interest, then it is a riba-based loan on which there is scholarly consensus     that it is haraam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Imam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:    “Every loan in which it is stipulated that     something extra must be paid back is haraam, with no difference of scholarly     opinion. Ibn al-Mundhir said: [the scholars] are unanimously agreed that if     the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay extra or give him a gift,     and he lends him money on that basis, then accepting the extra payment is     riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood that     they forbade every loan that brings benefits. End quote from     al-Mughni (6/436). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: Every     additional amount given in return for a loan or favour that benefits the     lender is riba, even if it is just a handful of animal feed. That is haraam     if it is stipulated. End quote.&nbsp; End quote from    al-Kaafi (2/359).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    A loss in the buying power of money does not make it     permissible to stipulate interest which is the essence of riba. Rather the     loan should be repaid as is even if its value has decreased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It says in Mawsoo’ah Fataawa al-Azhar, in a fatwa of     Shaykh Jaad al-Haqq, the former Shaykh of al-Azhar (may Allaah have mercy on     him) concerning the issue under discussion, which we will quote for the     benefit of readers:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Question: The questioner was given some investment     certificates of group (b) by his father as a marriage gift, and they are     still in his possession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He is entitled to cash them in now and they have profits from     the time he kept them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    His question is: Are they halaal with their profits?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Please note that the cash value now with the profits is less     than their value at the time when they were bought and given.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    He replied: The fuqaha’ of sharee’ah defined riba as being     anything that is added to wealth without anything in return. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Allaah has forbidden riba in many verses of the Holy Qur’aan,     the last of which to be revealed, according to a saheeh report narrated from     Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), is the passage in which     Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the     meaning): &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    “Those who consume Riba will not stand (on the Day of     Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan     (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only     like Riba,’ whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba. So     whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Riba,     shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but     whoever returns (to Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will     abide therein. </p>\n<p>    276.&nbsp;Allaah will destroy Riba and will give increase for     Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allaah likes not the disbelievers,     sinners.”</p>\n<p>    [al-Baqarah 2:275-276]</p>\n<p>    It is also forbidden in the hadeeth which was narrated by     al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be     pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver,     wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for     like, hand to hand, and whoever gives more or asks for more has engaged in     riba; the taker and the giver are both the same.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because these texts imply that riba includes all additions to     the money borrowed or deposited on the basis of a precondition for nothing     in return, the Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is haraam, following     the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Because the investment certificates of group (b) bring a     specified amount of interest, that is stipulated in advance in terms of time     and amount, they come under the heading of riba that is forbidden in     sharee’ah on the basis of these texts, as it is a loan with interest that is     stipulated in advance in terms of time and amount. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for what is mentioned in the question about these purchase     certificates and their profits being less than their value at the time when     they were given to the questioner or at the time when they were bought, this     is not a valid justification for regarding this interest as permissible.     Imam al-Isbejaabi narrated in Sharh al-Tahhaawi that the fuqaha’ were     unanimously agreed that if money is not taken out of circulation, but its     value increases and decreases, the borrower must give what he took in terms     of amount so long as the type of money is specified (Risaalat Tanbeeh     al-Ruqood ‘ala Masaa’il al-Muqood min Rakhs wa Ghala’ wa Kasaad wa Inqitaa’     by al-‘Allaamah Ibn ‘Aabideen (vol. 2, Majmoo’ al-Rasaa’il p.     58-67).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As this is the case, the nominal value of these certificates     is permissible, as it originally most likely came as a gift from halaal     earnings, as we assume that the believers are of good&nbsp; character and     conduct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    As for the interest that was earned in accordance with the     system, it is riba which is haraam because it was specified, and it is not     permissible for the Muslim to benefit from this interest because it is     haraam earnings. He may take it and dispose of it in any charitable way such     as building mosques or hospitals or giving it to a poor or needy person in     the ways indicated by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to disposal of haraam earnings,     so as to free the Muslim of any responsibility before Allaah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is narrated in a hadeeth that Abu Barzah al-Aslami (may     Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and     blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The feet of the slave will not move     on the Day of Resurrection until he is asked about his life and how he spent     it, his knowledge and what he did with it, his wealth and how he earned it     and how he spent it, and his body and what he did with it.” And Allaah, may     He be glorified, knows best. End quote.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Hence we say to our brother: You should either look for     Islamically-acceptable ways of investing the money, even if that is buying     goods which usually keep their value, such as land and gold and the like,     or&nbsp; by being patient and seeking reward, and putting up with the loss in     value that results from keeping money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    It is not permissible to put money in a riba-based bank     except for the purpose of protecting it if there is the fear that it may be     stolen. In that case it should be put in a current account, not in a savings     account, so as to do the lesser of two evils. If interest is paid on it,     then you must get rid of it by giving it to the poor and needy or spending     it in the public interest, and it is not permissible for the owner of the     money to benefit from any of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    We ask Allaah to help and guide us and you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>    And Allaah knows best.</p>\n",
