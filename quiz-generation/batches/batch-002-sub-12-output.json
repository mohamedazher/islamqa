      "question": "What is the authentic Du`a to say when breaking the fast according to the hadith from Ibn `Umar?",
      "options": [
        "\"Dhahaba ath-Thama'u, wa abtallat al-'urooq wa thabata al-ajr insha Allah\" (Thirst has gone, the veins are moist, and the reward is assured)",
        "\"Allahumma laka sumtu wa 'ala rizqika aftartu\" (O Allah, for You I have fasted and by Your provision I have broken the fast)",
        "\"Ashhadu alla ilaha ill-Allah astaghfir Allah as'aluka al-jannah\" (I bear witness that none is worthy of worship but Allah, I ask for Paradise)",
        "No specific Du`a is recommended when breaking the fast according to the Sunnah"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The authentic hadith narrated by Abu Dawud from Ibn `Umar states that when the Prophet broke his fast, he would say \"Dhahaba ath-Thama'u, wa abtallat al-'urooq wa thabata al-ajr insha Allah.\" This hadith was classed as sound by Al-Albani. The Du`a \"Allahumma laka sumtu\" comes from an inauthentic hadith, and the other Du`a has no known source.",

      "question": "According to the answer, what is the most important factor to consider when deciding whether to proceed with a marriage to someone who lives far away?",
      "options": [
        "His relationship with his Lord and adherence to his religion, especially his commitment to regular prayer and good character",
        "Whether relatives approve of the marriage and interfere to prevent separation",
        "The compatibility in minor matters and ability to reach understanding quickly",
        "The length of time the couple has known each other before engagement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The answer emphasizes that the most important matter is the man's relationship with his Lord and adherence to his religion. If he is righteous, prays regularly, and has good character, he will help his family obey Allah. This is especially important if the woman will travel far from her family, as religious commitment prevents mistreatment and injustice.",

      "question": "What is the ruling on leaving excess baggage at the airport when you were entrusted to transport someone's luggage?",
      "options": [
        "It is considered negligence, and the person becomes liable for those goods and must replace them or pay their value",
        "The person is not liable because there was no prior written agreement specifying responsibility for all items",
        "Since most of the luggage was delivered successfully, the person fulfilled their duty and is not liable for forgotten items",
        "The person is only liable if they were being paid for the service, not if they were doing it voluntarily"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The answer clearly states that luggage given to transport is a trust (amanah), and the person is not liable unless they transgressed or were negligent. Leaving excess baggage at the airport is specifically described as negligence. Therefore, the person is liable and should have contacted the owner, paid excess baggage fees, or made other arrangements.",

      "question": "According to Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen, what types of knowledge are included in the hadith about beneficial knowledge that continues after death?",
      "options": [
        "The hadith is general and includes any beneficial knowledge, with Islamic knowledge being first and foremost, including teaching permissible crafts",
        "Only knowledge of Quran recitation, hadith memorization, and fiqh rulings qualify as beneficial knowledge",
        "Worldly subjects like physics and mathematics never count as beneficial knowledge mentioned in the hadith",
        "Teaching worldly subjects only counts as beneficial knowledge if you charge fees, not if offered for free"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen stated that what appears to be the case is that the hadith is general in meaning, and for any knowledge that is beneficial, a person will attain reward. He specifically mentioned that if someone teaches a permissible craft or manufacturing and it was beneficial, they will be rewarded, though Islamic knowledge is first and foremost.",

      "question": "What is the Sunnah method for wiping the ears during wudu according to the authentic hadiths?",
      "options": [
        "Wipe both ears at the same time using index fingers inside and thumbs outside, not starting with the right ear first",
        "Wipe the right ear completely first, then wipe the left ear, following the principle of starting on the right",
        "Wiping the ears is optional during wudu, so any method or order is equally valid",
        "Wipe the left ear first to distinguish it from washing hands and feet where right comes first"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The authentic hadith in Abu Dawud shows that the Prophet put his index fingers into his ears and wiped the outside with his thumbs, doing both ears simultaneously. An-Nawawi stated that scholars say the ears should be wiped at the same time, not the right ear first. Starting on the right applies only to hands and feet, not ears.",

      "options": [
        "It is a weak (da'eef) hadith with unknown narrators in its chain, classed as munkar by Al-Albani",
        "It is authentic according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari and was verified by Al-Haythami",
        "It is weak but still recommended to act upon it as a precautionary measure before traveling",
        "The chain contains only known and trustworthy narrators according to Al-Albani's research"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Al-Haythami said the isnaad includes people who he does not know (unknown narrators), and Shaykh Al-Albani classed it as munkar in As-Silsilah Ad-Da'eefah. Therefore, it is not valid to quote this hadith as evidence for reciting specific surahs before traveling or for saying the basmalah at the beginning of each surah.",

      "question": "What determines whether praying in half sleeves or bareheaded is contrary to the command to adorn oneself for prayer?",
      "options": [
        "It depends on the customs of each country - if the custom considers it proper adornment, it's acceptable; if not, it goes against what Allah enjoined",
        "It is always forbidden to pray bareheaded because men must cover their heads just as women are required to do",
        "Half sleeves are never acceptable for prayer regardless of location since Islam requires full arm coverage",
        "Adornment for prayer means only covering the 'awrah, so anything beyond that is purely optional everywhere"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The scholars explained that while adornment for prayer is commanded and additional to covering 'awrah, this adornment varies by country and customs. If the custom is that best adornment requires covered head or full sleeves, then praying without these goes against Allah's command. But if the custom accepts half sleeves or bare heads as proper adornment, there is nothing wrong with it.",

      "question": "What is the minimum number of rak'ahs for Qiyam al-layl (night prayer)?",
      "options": [
        "Two rak'ahs, as indicated by authentic hadiths, with no maximum limit",
        "One rak'ah is sufficient according to the authentic hadith from Ibn 'Abbas about voluntary night prayer",
        "Eight rak'ahs is the minimum as unanimously agreed upon by all scholars of fiqh",
        "Since Witr is part of Qiyam and can be one rak'ah, the minimum for Qiyam is also one rak'ah"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The authentic hadith states \"Whoever wakes up at night and wakes his wife, and they pray two rak'ahs together, they will be recorded among the men and women who remember Allah much.\" The scholars confirmed the minimum is two rak'ahs. Reports suggesting one rak'ah are weak, and Witr is not part of Qiyam al-layl according to the most likely scholarly view.",

      "question": "What is the Islamic ruling on participating in lotteries, even if the money raised is for charitable projects?",
      "options": [
        "Lotteries are another name for gambling and are haram according to Quran, Sunnah and scholarly consensus, even if proceeds go to charity",
        "Lotteries are permissible if all the money collected goes to Islamic charitable projects like helping mujahidin",
        "Occasional participation in lotteries is allowed as long as it doesn't become a regular habit",
        "Lotteries are only haram when they involve intoxicants or idol-worship as mentioned alongside gambling in the Quran"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Shaykh Ibn Baz stated that lotteries and raffles are other names for gambling, which is haram according to the Quran and Sunnah. It is not permissible to engage in gambling even if the money is for charitable projects, because it is evil and forbidden. Shaykh Al-'Uthaymin explained that any transaction where a person may win or lose and doesn't know the outcome is gambling and haram.",

      "question": "Why is it not permissible for locals to take Mus-hafs that the state distributes to pilgrims?",
      "options": [
        "These Mus-hafs are a waqf (endowment) designated specifically for pilgrims, and diverting a waqf from its specified purpose is not permissible",
        "It is permissible if the locals distribute them to people who will use them for Quran teaching and memorization",
        "Locals can take them as long as sufficient quantities remain for the arriving pilgrims",
        "Since they are copies of the Book of Allah, any Muslim can take them regardless of the original intended recipients"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Standing Committee explained that these Mus-hafs are a waqf to be distributed in the specified manner (to pilgrims), and it is not permissible to divert the waqf from what has been specified. Taking them defeats the purpose of supplying pilgrims who may not be able to obtain them otherwise. Locals can obtain Mus-hafs from the Department that distributes them to locals.",
