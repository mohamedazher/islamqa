End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Prof. Dr. \r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-Fattaah Mahmoud Idrees says: With regard to the benefits of camel&rsquo;s \r\n    urine in treating disease, Ibn Seena said in his <i>Qanoon<\/i>: The most \r\n    beneficial of urine is the urine of the Bedouin camels known as <i>najeeb<\/i>. \r\n    Camel&rsquo;s urine is beneficial in treating <i>al-hazaaz<\/i>, and it was said \r\n    that <i>al-hazzaz<\/i> is a pain in the heart caused by anger and so on. \r\n    Camel&rsquo;s urine, especially the urine of a young she-camel &ndash; is used as a \r\n    cleansing substance to wash wounds and sores, to make the hair grow, to \r\n    strengthen and thicken it and to prevent it falling out, and it is used to \r\n    treat diseases of the scalp and dandruff. In a Master&rsquo;s thesis by an \r\n    engineer in applied chemistry, Muhammad Awhaaj Muhammad, that was submitted \r\n    to the faculty of applied chemistry in the <i>al-Jazeerah<\/i> university in \r\n    Sudan, and approved by the Dean of science and postgraduate studies in the \r\n    university in November 1998 CE, entitled <i>A Study of the Chemical \r\n    Composition and Some Medical Uses of the Urine of Arabian Camels<\/i>, \r\n    Muhammad Awhaaj says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Laboratory \r\n    tests indicate that camel&rsquo;s urine contains high levels of potassium, \r\n    albuminous proteins, and small amounts of uric acid, sodium and creatine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In this \r\n    study, he explained that what prompted him to study the medicinal properties \r\n    of camel&rsquo;s urine was what he had seen of some tribesmen drinking this urine \r\n    whenever they suffered digestion problems. He sought the help of some \r\n    doctors in studying camel&rsquo;s urine. They brought a number of patients and \r\n    prescribed this urine for them, for a period of two months. Their bodies \r\n    recovered from what they had been suffering from, which proves the efficacy \r\n    of camel&rsquo;s urine in treating some diseases of the digestive system.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It also \r\n    proves that this urine is useful in preventing hair loss. He says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Camel&rsquo;s \r\n    urine acts as a slow-acting diuretic, but it does not deplete potassium and \r\n    other salts as other diuretics do, because camel&rsquo;s urine contains a high \r\n    level of potassium and proteins. It has also been proven to be effective \r\n    against some types of bacteria and viruses. It brought about an improvement \r\n    in the condition of twenty-five patients who used camel&rsquo;s urine for dropsy, \r\n    without disrupting their potassium levels. Two of them were cured of liver \r\n    pain, and their liver function was restored to normal levels, as well as the \r\n    tissue of the liver being improved. One of the medicines used to treat blood \r\n    clots is a compound called Fibrinoltics which works by changing a substance \r\n    in the body from its inactive form, Plasminogen, to its active form, \r\n    Plasmin, in order to dissolve the substance that causes clotting, Fibrin. \r\n    One of the components of this compound is called Urokinase, which is \r\n    produced by the kidneys or from the urine, as indicated by the name &ldquo;uro&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The dean of \r\n    the Faculty of Medical Science in the Sudanese al-Jazeerah university, \r\n    Professor Ahmad &lsquo;Abd-Allaah Ahmadaani, has discovered a practical way of \r\n    using camel&rsquo;s urine to treat dropsy and swelling in the liver. Its success \r\n    has been proven in treating those who are affected by these diseases. He \r\n    said in a seminar organized by the al-Jazeerah University:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The \r\n    experiment began by giving each patient a daily dose of camel&rsquo;s urine mixed \r\n    with camel&rsquo;s milk to make it palatable. Fifteen days after the beginning of \r\n    the experiment, the patients&rsquo; stomachs grew smaller and went back to their \r\n    normal size. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He said that \r\n    he examined the patients&rsquo; livers with ultrasound before the study began, and \r\n    he found out that the livers of fifteen out of the twenty-five were in a \r\n    cirrhotic state, and some of them had developed cirrhosis of the liver as \r\n    the result of bilharzia. All of the patients responded to treatment with \r\n    camel&rsquo;s urine, and some of them continued, by their own choice, to drink a \r\n    dose of camel&rsquo;s urine every day for a further two months. At the end of that \r\n    time, they were all found to have been cured of cirrhosis of the liver. He \r\n    said: Camel&rsquo;s urine contains a large amount of potassium, as well as albumen \r\n    and magnesium, because the camel only drinks four times during the summer \r\n    and once during the winter, which makes it retain water in its body so as to \r\n    preserve the sodium, and the sodium causes it not to urinate a great deal, \r\n    because it keeps the water in its body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He explained \r\n    that dropsy results from a deficiency of albumen or potassium, and the urine \r\n    of camels in rich in both of these.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He suggested \r\n    that the best type of camels for using the urine as a remedy are young \r\n    camels.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Dr. Ahlaam \r\n    al-&lsquo;Awadi, a specialist in microbiology in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\n    supervised some scientific papers that dealt with her discoveries in the \r\n    usage of camel&rsquo;s urine for medical treatment, such as the papers by &lsquo;Awaatif \r\n    al-Jadeedi and Manaal al-Qattaan. During her supervision of the paper by \r\n    Manaal al-Qattaan, she succeeded in confirming the effectiveness of using a \r\n    preparation made from camel&rsquo;s urine which was the first antibiotic produced \r\n    in this manner anywhere in the world. Concerning the features of this new \r\n    product, Dr. Ahlaam said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not \r\n    costly, and it is easy to manufacture. It can be used to treat skin diseases \r\n    such as eczema, allergies, sores, burns, acne, nail infections, cancer, \r\n    hepatitis and dropsy with no harmful side effects.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And she \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Camel&rsquo;s \r\n    urine contains a number of healing factors such as antibiotics (bacteria \r\n    that are present in it, salts and urea).&nbsp; The camel possesses an immune \r\n    system that is highly equipped to combat funguses, bacteria and viruses, \r\n    because it contains antibodies. It may also be used to treat blood clots and \r\n    fibrinolytics may be derived from it, and it may be used to treat dropsy \r\n    (which is caused by a deficiency in albumen and potassium, as camel&rsquo;s urine \r\n    is rich in both). Camel&rsquo;s urine may also provide a remedy for abdominal \r\n    complaints, especially those of the stomach and intestines, as well as \r\n    asthma and shortness of breath. It caused a noticeable reduction in \r\n    patients&rsquo; sugar levels. It is a remedy for low libido, and it aids in bone \r\n    growth in children and in strengthening the heart muscles. It may be used as \r\n    a cleansing agent for cleaning wounds and sores, especially the urine of \r\n    young she-camels. It also helps the hair to grow and become strong and \r\n    thick, and it helps to prevent hair loss and baldness, and can be used to \r\n    treat dandruff. Camel&rsquo;s urine may also be used to combat disease by using \r\n    bacteria extracted from it. It was used to treat a girl who was suffering \r\n    from an infection behind the ear, that was accompanied by pus weeping from \r\n    it and painful cracks and sores. It was also used to treat a girl who was \r\n    unable to extend the fingers of her hands because of the presence of so many \r\n    cracks and sores, and whose face was almost black with pimples. Dr. Ahlaam \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Camel&rsquo;s \r\n    urine may also be used to treat the digestive system and to treat some cases \r\n    of cancer. She stated that the research that she had undertaken on camel&rsquo;s \r\n    urine proved that it was effective in destroying micro-organisms such as \r\n    fungus, yeast and bacteria.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Dr. Rahmah \r\n    al-&lsquo;Ulyaani, who is also from Saudi Arabia, carried out tests on rabbits \r\n    infected with bacteria in the colon. She treated each group of rabbits with \r\n    a different kind of medicine, including camel&rsquo;s urine. There was a \r\n    noticeable regression in the rabbits that were treated with other medicines, \r\n    except for camel&rsquo;s urine, which brought about a clear improvement.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Majallat \r\n    al-Jundi al-Muslim<\/i>, issue no. 118, 20 Dhu&rsquo;l-Qa&rsquo;dah \r\n    1425 AH; 1 January 2005 CE.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah calls \r\n    upon us to ponder the creation of the camel, as He says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Do they \r\n    not look at the camels, how they are created?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    [al-Ghaashiyah 88:17]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This \r\n    pondering is not limited to the outward form of the camel, or even to the \r\n    inner workings of its body, rather it also includes that which we have \r\n    discussed here, which is the benefits of the urine and milk of the camel. \r\n    Modern scientific research is still discovering for us many of the wonders \r\n    of this creature.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah \r\n    knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11002","question_id":"11002","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Jathoom \r\n    is the <i>kaboos<\/i> (incubus, evil spirit, nightmare) that descends upon a \r\n    person in his sleep.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn \r\n    al-Manzoor said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Jathaam \r\n    or al-Jathoom is the kaboos that descends upon a person at night&hellip; the one \r\n    that descends upon a person when he is sleeping is called al-jathoom.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Lisaan \r\n    al-&lsquo;Arab<\/i> (12\/83)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He also \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The kaboos \r\n    is the one that descends upon the sleeper at night.

A righteous child is a treasure for his parents in this world and \r\n    in the Hereafter, and his righteous deeds will be recorded in the balance of \r\n    his parents&rsquo; deeds. A man or a woman may be faced with lack of children or \r\n    delay of having children. What they must do is be patient and seek reward, \r\n    and say a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and prayers for forgiveness. They should understand \r\n    that Allaah only decrees things for a reason. If a person has available \r\n    Islamically acceptable means of getting children, there is nothing wrong \r\n    with his pursuing that. But the Muslim should beware of false ways involving \r\n    sihr (witchcraft) and myths, and he should beware of doctors who do not fear \r\n    Allaah and whose main aim is to make money from those who want to have \r\n    children. Hence some of them switch eggs or sperm. This is why some scholars \r\n    have forbidden these methods of having children or have stipulated very \r\n    strict conditions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the methods that doctors use to help couples have \r\n    children is that which is mentioned in the question, namely IVF. This method \r\n    involves stimulating the ovary to produce a number of eggs, similar to the \r\n    way in which a woman naturally produces one egg. This is done by giving the \r\n    woman an injection of Decapeptyl to prepare the ovaries for the next step, \r\n    which is injections of hormones to stimulate the ovaries to produce a number \r\n    of eggs. After ascertaining that the eggs have grown, the woman is given an \r\n    injection of HCG to complete the development of the eggs before they are \r\n    extracted. This injection is usually given 36 hours before the eggs are \r\n    extracted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On the day on which the eggs are extracted, semen is taken \r\n    from the husband and 100,000 sperm are placed with each egg in a test tube \r\n    so that fertilization may take place. Two or three days later, the \r\n    fertilized eggs divide to form what is called the embryo, and the embryos \r\n    are divided into categories according to their quality.

The basic principle concerning these is that \r\n    they are also permissible, so long as they do not include anything that is \r\n    haraam such as intoxicants, and are not harmful, in which case they are \r\n    haraam for these two reasons. But they should not be used unless there is a \r\n    need for that, such as being incapacitated, sick or elderly, and in \r\n    consultation with a trustworthy medical specialist, because some of them are \r\n    harmful and may be lethal, and others are not lethal but there is no benefit \r\n    to be gained by using them if one is healthy and has no need of them, even \r\n    if they increase desire as mentioned in the question. He spoke well who \r\n    said: Medicine is like soap: it cleans the garment but it also wears it out. \r\n    So one should avoid using medicines as much as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We will give you an example \r\n    of a medicine which has become widespread nowadays, namely the drug called \r\n    Viagra. Use of this drug by some people without any medical exam or \r\n    consultation has led to a great deal of harm. Concerning this, Dr. \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah al-Nu&rsquo;aymi, a heart specialist in the Zaayid Military Hospital \r\n    said during a seminar on aphrodisiacs: This drug has side effects, some of \r\n    which are severe. There is a study that was carried out in Canada on 8500 \r\n    people which found that 16% of them suffered headaches and some of them \r\n    suffered redness and heat especially in the face; some of them suffered from \r\n    digestive problems and some, especially those who had low blood pressure, \r\n    found that their blood pressure dropped to dangerous levels. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He stated that healthy \r\n    people who do not have any health problems should still consult a doctor, if \r\n    only briefly, whilst those who had problems, especially any blockage of the \r\n    arteries of the heart, must consult a doctor first, because &ldquo;many of them \r\n    take drugs called nitrates, which interact strongly with Viagra. Viagra \r\n    prevents this drug from being absorbed by the sick person&rsquo;s body. We found \r\n    that the nitrates were multiplied ten times in some cases, which leads to a \r\n    severe drop in blood pressure, and may cause death. We have heard of deaths \r\n    which have occurred and most of these deaths happened in such cases, where \r\n    the person had a heart attack and he had a blockage in the arteries and was \r\n    taking nitrates, so when he took Viagra with the nitrates, the nitrates \r\n    multiplied many times and this led to the side effects. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to taking these \r\n    aphrodisiacs, no distinction is made between the nights of Ramadaan or any \r\n    other time when it is permissible to eat and drink. What is permissible to \r\n    consume is permissible at all times and what is haraam is also haraam at all \r\n    times. Allaah has permitted the fasting person to enjoy intimacy with his \r\n    wife after breaking his fast, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;It is made lawful for \r\n    you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As&#8209;Sawm (the \r\n    fasts). They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you \r\n    enjoy the pleasure of living with them &mdash; as in Verse 7:189) Tafsir \r\n    At-Tabari] for you and you are the same for them. Allaah knows that you used \r\n    to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and \r\n    forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which \r\n    Allaah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white \r\n    thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread \r\n    (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall. And \r\n    do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in \r\n    I&lsquo;tikaaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations \r\n    leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) \r\n    by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat \r\n    (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and \r\n    illegal things, Allaah&rsquo;s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may \r\n    become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:187]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11009","question_id":"11009","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to heal you and make you well, and we ask Him, \r\n    may He be exalted, to increase your reward.

The Shaafa&rsquo;is are \r\n    of the view that tanning purifies all kinds of skin, whether the animal is \r\n    one that is permissible to eat or not, apart from (the skin of) dogs and \r\n    pigs. Abu Haneefah was of the view that an exception is made in the case of \r\n    pigs only. Imam Ahmad and Maalik were of the view that no skins of dead meat \r\n    can be purified by means of tanning, including pigskin. There is a report \r\n    from Ahmad which says that the skin of that which was pure in life may be \r\n    purified by means of tanning, even if the meat of the animal is not \r\n    permissible to eat, and there is another report which says that nothing can \r\n    be purified by means of tanning except only the skin of animals whose meat \r\n    is permissible to eat.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Dawood al-Zaahiri and Ibn \r\n    Hazm were of the view &ndash; and it was narrated from Abu Yoosuf, the companion \r\n    of Abu Haneefah, and some of the Maalikis such as Sahnoon, Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Hakam \r\n    and &lsquo;Abd al-Mun&rsquo;im ibn al-Faras, and al-Shawkaani among later scholars &ndash; \r\n    that all kinds of skins may be purified by means of tanning, including the \r\n    skins of dogs and pigs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars differed \r\n    concerning the ruling on making use of pigskin after it has been tanned. As \r\n    for those who were of the view that it is pure after tanning, they have no \r\n    doubt that it is permissible to use it for all kinds of purposes. Some of \r\n    those who said that tanning does not make pigskin pure said that it is \r\n    permissible to make use of it in dry circumstances but not in wet \r\n    circumstances. This was narrated from the Hanbalis. What that means is that \r\n    it may be used as a container for grains, and it may also be used in \r\n    clothing such as shoes and the like. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah <\/i>(20\/34) it says: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fuqaha&rsquo; are unanimously \r\n    agreed that pigskin cannot be purified by tanning and it is not permissible \r\n    to use it because it is impure in and of itself and tanning is like life, \r\n    because being alive does not make it pure, and the same applies to tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Abu \r\n    Yoosuf that pigskin does become pure by means of tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is another report \r\n    which differs from the well-known Maaliki view; It was narrated from &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-Mun&rsquo;im ibn al-Faras, that pigskin is like any other kind of skin, and it \r\n    is permissible to use it in dry and wet circumstances once it has been \r\n    tanned, whether it was slaughtered in the proper manner or not. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In the answer to question \r\n    no. [fatin]1695[\\fatin] we have stated that \r\n    pigskin is impure and does not become pure by means of tanning. In the \r\n    answer to question no. [fatin]13213[\\fatin] we \r\n    quoted Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) as saying that in \r\n    order to be on the safe side it is better not to use it even if it has been \r\n    tanned, because of the difference of opinion concerning it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>From the above it is clear \r\n    that the issue of whether pigskin is purified by means of tanning is the \r\n    matter of ijtihaad, and it is not like the ruling on pig meat (pork etc). \r\n    The prohibition on pig meat is a matter on which there is unanimous \r\n    agreement and it is not permissible to dispute that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on the view that \r\n    pigskin becomes pure by means of tanning, there is no doubt that it is \r\n    permissible to use it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on the view that it \r\n    does not become pure by means of tanning, there is no doubt that it is \r\n    permissible to use it if that is necessary. If there is consensus that it is \r\n    permissible to eat pig meat in cases of necessity, even though it is \r\n    unanimously agreed that it is haraam, then it is more likely that it is \r\n    permissible to use the skin after tanning, concerning which there is a \r\n    difference of opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the specific \r\n    issue of using pigskin to make valves for the heart, if it is not possible \r\n    to make the valve from pure (taahir) skin, then it is permissible to make it \r\n    from pigskin out of necessity, and it should be used in preference to the \r\n    metal which would require one to take medicines permanently, which may lead \r\n    to many side-effects.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person breaks a bone, \r\n    it should be set using a pure bone. Our companions &ndash; i.e., the Shaafa&rsquo;is &ndash; \r\n    said: it is not permissible to set it using something impure, when one is \r\n    able to use something pure instead. If he sets it using something impure the \r\n    matter is subject to further discussion.&nbsp; If it needs to be set and he could \r\n    not find anything pure to use instead, then he is excused. But if that was \r\n    not necessary and there was something pure that could be used instead, then \r\n    he has sinned and it must be removed if there is no fear that he may die or \r\n    the limb may be damaged as a result.

To proceed:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World \r\n    League, in its nineteenth session held in Makkah al-Mukarramah, 22-27 \r\n    Shawwaal 1428 AH\/3-8 November 2007 CE, examined the issue of choosing the \r\n    gender of the foetus. After listening to the research that was presented, \r\n    consulting specialists and a great deal of discussion,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Council affirms that the basic principle for the Muslim \r\n    is to accept the will and the decree of Allah and to be content with \r\n    whatever children Allah blesses him with, whether they are male or female, \r\n    and he should praise Allah for that, as the choice of the Creator is best \r\n    for us, may He be glorified and exalted, chooses.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan there is criticism of the people of the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah for not accepting and being content with the child if it was \r\n    female. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is \r\n    brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inward \r\n    grief!<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>59.&nbsp;He hides himself from the people because of the evil \r\n    of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonour or \r\n    bury her in the earth? Certainly, evil is their decision&rdquo; <\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nahl 16:58]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with a person wanting a child to be \r\n    male or female, based on the fact that the Holy Qur'aan refers to the \r\n    supplication of some of the Prophets asking that they be blessed with a male \r\n    child. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the light of that, the Council has determined the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is permissible to choose the gender of the foetus by \r\n    natural means, such as following a certain nutrition plan, chemical washes, \r\n    and choosing times for intercourse according to the time of ovulation, \r\n    because these are permissible means and there are no reservations about \r\n    them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible to use any kind of medical intervention \r\n    to choose the gender of the foetus, except in cases of medical necessity \r\n    with regard to hereditary diseases which affect males but not females or \r\n    vice versa. In that case intervention is permissible, subject to established \r\n    shar&lsquo;i guidelines, so long as that is done on the basis of a committee of \r\n    specialist doctors consisting of no less than three doctors of good \r\n    character, who produce a medical report stating that the case calls for \r\n    medical intervention so that the foetus will not be affected by the \r\n    hereditary disease. Then after that, this medical report should be submitted \r\n    to the Department for Issuing Fatwas so that they may issue a ruling as they \r\n    see fit in that case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is essential to establish &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; committees that will \r\n    keep a close watch on hospitals and medical centres which carry out such \r\n    procedures in Muslim countries, so as to prevent any practices that may go \r\n    against the content of the report. In Muslim countries official bodies \r\n    should set up systems and guidelines to achieve this.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad \r\n    and his family and Companions.

One of the implications of this principle is that\r\n      &ldquo;it is not permissible for a man to prevent his land from being flooded\r\n      by diverting the flood waters onto someone else&rsquo;s land.&rdquo; By the same\r\n      token, it is not permissible for a girl and her mother to remove harm from\r\n      themselves by having the hymen repaired and thus causing harm to the\r\n      husband.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Sixthly: the basic idea of repairing the hymen\r\n      is not permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah because it is a kind of\r\n      deceit, and deceit is forbidden in Islam.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Seventhly: repairing the hymen pavest he way\r\n      for girls and their families to tell lies about the real reason why the\r\n      hymen was ruptured, and lying is also forbidden in Islam.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Eighthly: repairing the hymen paves the way\r\n      for doctors to resort to performing abortions for the purposes of\r\n      concealing sin.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Evidence for the second opinion:&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Firstly: the texts indicate that it is\r\n      permissible and is encouraged to conceal sins, and repairing the hymen\r\n      helps to achieve that in cases where this operation is permissible.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Secondly: if a woman who is innocent of any\r\n      immoral action is allowed to have this operation so as to leave no room\r\n      for suspicion, this will ward off unjustice for her and will achieve the\r\n      aim prescribed by sharee&rsquo;ah of thinking well of believing men and women.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Thirdly: repairing the hymen has to ward off\r\n      harm . If a woman was left without having this operation done, and her\r\n      husband were to notice that, it would cause trouble for her and her\r\n      family, and if the matter became well known among people, the family may\r\n      never be able to find marriage partners for their daughters.

He should be told about it, and if he accepts\r\n      then the evil consequence is not longer an issue, as is also the case if\r\n      he decides not to go ahead with the marriage.<\/span><span>&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>The response to the fourth :<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>Even though there are some positive aspects to\r\n      this concealment, there are also negative consequences, such as making it\r\n      easy for women to commit zinaa.

We are \r\n    happy to help readers by quoting from the research of Dr. &lsquo;Abd al-Rahman \r\n    al-Yahya, in which he says: Nutrition has an effect on choosing the sex of \r\n    the foetus in two ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It alters the pH balance in the \r\n    cervix of the uterus and the vagina. Potassium and sodium turn the \r\n    environment to alkaline and thus increase the chances of conceiving a male. \r\n    As for magnesium and calcium, they turn the environment to acidic, thus \r\n    increasing the chances of conceiving a female.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Changes in the wall of the ovum \r\n    which increase the length of the period during which the ovum is receptive \r\n    to male or female sperm. Research has proven that the woman's diet has an \r\n    effect on the sex of the foetus, because it has an effect on the receptors \r\n    to which the sperm attaches itself on the walls of the ovum, and by means of \r\n    which it penetrates the wall, thus leading to fertilization.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The ionic balance of sodium and potassium, as opposed to \r\n    calcium and magnesium, has a biological effect on these receptors, which \r\n    leads to changes in the composition of the wall, which in turn affects the \r\n    attraction of male or female sperm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The effect of these ions is simple: a higher ratio of sodium \r\n    and potassium in the food and a lower ratio of calcium and magnesium causes \r\n    changes in the wall of the ovum to attract male sperm and repel female \r\n    sperm. Hence the result of fertilization will be male. The opposite is also \r\n    true: a higher ratio of calcium and magnesium in the blood, and a lower \r\n    level of sodium and potassium, attracts sperm which carries the female \r\n    chromosome and repels sperm which carries the male chromosome, hence the \r\n    result of fertilization and pregnancy will be female.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To follow this method, a woman has to follow a specific diet \r\n    for a period of no less than two months, so as to build up nutritional \r\n    stores which will encourage the desired gender. We attach a diet plan which \r\n    shows the sources of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium in food.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The women who wants to choose the gender of the baby before \r\n    conception has to follow this diet for at least 2 to 3 months before \r\n    pregnancy (without using any hormonal contraceptives; rather barrier methods \r\n    such as condoms should be used). It is good if the husband follows the same \r\n    diet plan; although it is not essential for him, at least that will be a \r\n    psychological support to the wife and help her to stick to the diet plan. \r\n    The women should continue with this diet until she is certain that she is \r\n    pregnant.

What our companions [i.e., the Hanbalis] said is well known. \r\n    They said that if a pregnant woman dies and there is a living child in her \r\n    womb, it is haraam to open her abdomen, but some women (midwives) should try \r\n    manually to bring out the foetus who it is hoped might live. If that is not \r\n    possible, then she should not be buried until the one who is in her womb had \r\n    died too. If (the child) has been partially born and is alive, then a cut \r\n    may be made in order to birth the rest of him. This is the view of the \r\n    fuqaha&rsquo;, based on the view that this is mutilation by cutting, and the basic \r\n    principle is that mutilating the deceased is haraam, unless it serves a \r\n    certain greater purpose, i.e., if the child has been partially born and is \r\n    alive, then a cut may be made in order to birth the rest of him, because \r\n    that is in the interests of the infant, and because not cutting in this case \r\n    will lead to the negative consequence of the child dying, and the living \r\n    should be given greater care than the dead. But in modern times, when the \r\n    art of surgery has become more refined, cutting the abdomen or any other \r\n    part of the body is not regarded as mutilation; they do it to the living \r\n    with their consent and agreement for various kinds of treatment, and it is \r\n    most likely that if the fuqaha&rsquo; had seen that, they would have ruled that it \r\n    is permissible to cut the abdomen of the pregnant woman in order to extract \r\n    her living foetus, especially if the pregnancy is full term and it is known \r\n    or thought most likely that the foetus is alive.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another thing which points to it being permissible to cut the \r\n    abdomen and extract the living foetus is the fact that if there is a \r\n    conflict between pros and cons, then the greater good should be given \r\n    precedence and the lesser evil may be committed. Sparing the abdomen from \r\n    any cutting is good, but saving the child and keeping him alive is a greater \r\n    good. Cutting the abdomen is bad, but leaving the living child to suffocate \r\n    in her womb until he dies is a greater evil. So cutting becomes the lesser \r\n    of two evils. Moreover, we say that in such cases, cutting is not regarded \r\n    as mutilation or evil, so there is nothing to rule out extracting the foetus \r\n    at all. And Allaah knows best.

What are the guidelines, may Allaah bless and reward \r\n    you and benefit others through you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: With regard to the beautification that you \r\n    mentioned, beautification is of two types. The first type is done to remove \r\n    faults and the second type is done to increase beauty. The first type &ndash; \r\n    removing faults &ndash; is permissible; if a person&rsquo;s nose is bent, it is \r\n    permissible for him to have surgery to straighten it, because this is \r\n    removing a fault. The nose is not normal, rather it is bent, so he wants to \r\n    straighten it. The same applies to a man who has a squint; this is \r\n    undoubtedly a fault, so if he wants to have surgery to correct the fault, it \r\n    is permissible and there is no reason why he should not, because this is \r\n    removing a fault. If a man&rsquo;s nose is cut off due to an accident, can he have \r\n    a prosthetic nose installed?&nbsp; An incident of this type occurred at the time \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The nose of \r\n    one of the Sahaabah was cut off in battle and the man had a nose of silver \r\n    made, but the silver tarnished and developed an unpleasant smell, so the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him \r\n    permissible to have a nose made of gold, so he did that. Hence we say: is it \r\n    for beautification or to remove a fault? Removing a fault is permissible. \r\n    The same applies if the lip is cleft (harelip); it is permissible to join \r\n    the two sides because this is removing a fault.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the second type, which is increasing beauty, \r\n    this is what is not permissible. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who file their teeth for beauty, i.e., \r\n    they file them and make gaps between them for the purpose of beautification. \r\n    The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    cursed that, and he cursed women who put on hair extensions by adding hair \r\n    to their short hair and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It remains for us to examine whether an operation to enhance \r\n    or reduce the breast is permissible or not. This is a kind of \r\n    beautification, unless the woman who has small breasts wants to increase \r\n    them so that they can hold more milk, i.e., if her breast is too small&nbsp; and \r\n    cannot hold enough milk to satisfy for her child. In that case we may say \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with it. But for the purpose of beautification \r\n    it is not permissible. This is the guideline with regard to cosmetic \r\n    surgery. Cosmetic surgery is of two types: the first is removing faults and \r\n    there is nothing wrong with that; the second is increasing beauty and that \r\n    is not permissible.

These cells that are taken \r\n    from it play a role in rebuilding blood cells and strengthening the immune \r\n    system of patients with blood diseases such as leukaemia (blood cancer) and \r\n    anaemia. They may also be used to treat neurological diseases such as brain \r\n    paralysis, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and so on. These cells are not attacked by the immune \r\n    system, because they quickly develop into a neutral state. The umbilical \r\n    cord looks somewhat like a rope; it connects the foetus in the uterus to the \r\n    placenta. It contains two arteries and one vein. The arteries take blood \r\n    carrying waste material from the foetus to the placenta, and the vein takes \r\n    blood carrying oxygen and nutrients from the mother&rsquo;s blood to the foetus.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-&lsquo;Arabiyyah al-&lsquo;Aalamiyyah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are three sources for stem cells:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Stem cells taken from human \r\n    embryos between the ages of 5 days and two weeks.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Stem cells taken from adults, \r\n    which are collected in two ways:<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From bone marrow, i.e. from the bone itself, such as from the \r\n    bones of the pelvis or chest. The problem with this method is that it is \r\n    regarded as painful and requires a general anaesthetic; it also takes a long \r\n    time, in addition to the fact that the amount of stem cells collected in \r\n    this manner is very small. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From blood. This requires a large amount of blood to be \r\n    taken, then filtered, but in the end only a very small amount of stem cells \r\n    is obtained.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The last and most important \r\n    source of stem cells is the umbilical cord, which is a rich source of these \r\n    cells; it may contain as many as 200 million stem cells!<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the idea developed of keeping these cells in &ldquo;banks&rdquo;. \r\n    In Dubai there are public and private stem cell banks, and in Jeddah there \r\n    is a private company that stores cells for those who want that, in return \r\n    for a fee. These banks implement measures to guarantee that the cells will \r\n    not be tampered with; the owner can also follow up and check on them just as \r\n    he can check on the money in his bank account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some doctors have stated that it is possible to preserve \r\n    these cells for up to 25 years, and some doctors say that it is possible to \r\n    store them for life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These cells are useful not only for their owner who may be \r\n    affected by diseases in which he can benefit from them; rather he can also \r\n    donate them to others. Stem cells have indeed been used to treat cases of \r\n    sickness and they have been a successful alternative to the risky procedure \r\n    of transplanting bone marrow. From a medical point of view, stem cells are \r\n    regarded as an alternative to organ donation, as it is possible to \r\n    regenerate the patient&rsquo;s damaged cells.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For their owner, they are a perfect match for his cells, and \r\n    he is the only one who has a perfect match. Among members of the same \r\n    family, the likelihood of a match varies between 25% to 40%. All of this, of \r\n    course, applies so long as the mother does not have any communicable \r\n    diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS. Hence it is essential to carry out tests \r\n    on the mother&rsquo;s blood before collecting the stem cells. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if an individual keeps them for himself, there \r\n    should be no difference of opinion that it is permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because of these benefits in the cells that are taken from \r\n    the umbilical cord, some of those who do not fear Allah hastened to obtain \r\n    umbilical cords by means of deliberate abortion. We are sorry to say that \r\n    some of those whom people trusted with their lives did that. Hence there was \r\n    a clear statement by the Islamic Fiqh Council that it is haraam to carry out \r\n    deliberate abortions for the purpose of using the embryo&rsquo;s organs &ndash; \r\n    including stem cells, of course.

Doctors have stated that this method has been successful in \r\n    different kinds of animals and it is hoped that it will be successful whilst \r\n    taking the necessary medical precautions to avoid rejection by the immune \r\n    system.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: if the source of tissues is living cells from the \r\n    brain of an early embryo &ndash; as old as ten to eleven weeks &ndash; the ruling varies \r\n    according to the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The first method: taking the \r\n    tissue directly from a human foetus in the mother&rsquo;s uterus by opening the \r\n    uterus surgically; this method results in death of the embryo as soon as the \r\n    brain cells are taken, and it is haraam unless it happens after spontaneous \r\n    abortion (miscarriage) or an abortion that is permitted in sharee&lsquo;ah in \r\n    order to save the mother&rsquo;s life, and after ascertaining that the foetus has \r\n    died, whilst paying attention to the conditions which will be mentioned on \r\n    the topic of using embryos in statement no. 59 (6\/8) of this session.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The second method: this is the \r\n    method which may be brought about in the near future, which involves growing \r\n    brain cells in &ldquo;farms&rdquo; in order to make use of them. There is nothing wrong \r\n    with this from a shar&lsquo;i point of view, if the source of the cells is \r\n    legitimate and they were obtained in a manner that is Islamically \r\n    permissible.

In the third statement of the \r\n    Islamic Fiqh Council, dated 17\/12\/2003 CE, it says the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Stem cells, which are the original cells from which the \r\n    embryo is created, have the ability &ndash; by Allah&rsquo;s leave &ndash; to develop into \r\n    different types of cells in the human body. Scientists have recently been \r\n    able to find out about these cells and to isolate them and grow them with \r\n    the aim of using them for medical treatment and various scientific \r\n    experiments. Hence they can be used to treat disease and they are expected \r\n    to have a great impact in the future in treating many diseases and physical \r\n    deformities, including some types of cancer, diabetes, kidney and liver \r\n    failure, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These cells can be obtained from numerous sources, including \r\n    the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The embryo at the blastula \r\n    stage, where it forms a sphere of cells from which the various cells of the \r\n    body will grow.

It is also possible to \r\n    deliberately fertilise an egg from a donor with sperm from a donor in order \r\n    to obtain zygotes, and grow them until they reach the blastula stage, then \r\n    extract the stem cells from them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Aborted foetuses at any stage \r\n    of pregnancy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The placenta or umbilical cord<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Children and adults<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (v)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Cloning, which is done by \r\n    taking a cell from an adult human, then extracting its nucleus and inserting \r\n    it into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, with the aim of \r\n    reaching the blastula stage, then obtaining stem cells from it.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After listening to the research presented on this topic and \r\n    the opinions of members, experts and specialists, and finding out about this \r\n    type of cells and their sources, and the ways in which they may be used, the \r\n    Council took the following decision:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: it is permissible to obtain stem cells and grow \r\n    them, and use them for medical treatment or permissible scientific research, \r\n    if the sources are permissible.

If there \r\n    is no need for it, then the focus should be on treating hearts and souls, \r\n    guarding their well being, warding off (spiritual) sickness and protecting \r\n    them from what may harm them; this should be the priority. Taking care of \r\n    the body without taking care of the soul is of no benefit. If the body is \r\n    sick when the heart (soul) is sound, the harm done is minimal, and the harm \r\n    soon passes when it is followed by the perfect eternal benefits.

For example the Messenger of Allah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Seek medical treatment for \r\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has not created any disease but He \r\n    has also created the remedy for it apart from one disease, namely old age.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi; also narrated by Abu Dawood \r\n    and Ibn Maajah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may also be recommended according to sharee&lsquo;ah, such as if \r\n    it will lead to having children, which is enjoined in the texts of \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah, including the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And now have sexual relations with them \r\n    and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring)&rdquo; [al-Baqarah \r\n    2:187]<\/i>. And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Marry the one who is loving and fertile, for I will be proud of \r\n    your great numbers before the nations.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood and \r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i; it is saheeh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it is essential to pay attention to the guidelines set \r\n    out by specialists who are the experts in this field. Among the guidelines \r\n    that they have mentioned are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The patient who is suffering \r\n    from impotence should not take these aphrodisiacs until after consulting a \r\n    trustworthy, specialist doctor.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He should not rely completely \r\n    on these aphrodisiacs to the extent that the body cannot function properly \r\n    without them<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He should not go to excess in \r\n    taking them because doing so may lead to harm that threatens his life.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second case is using aphrodisiacs to attain more pleasure \r\n    and so on. The ruling in this case depends on the consequences of using \r\n    these aphrodisiacs unnecessarily. Specialists have stated that use of \r\n    aphrodisiacs by healthy persons for the purpose of increased pleasure may \r\n    lead to lasting harm. Medical studies have proven that consumption of \r\n    aphrodisiacs by healthy individuals has the opposite effect in the long \r\n    term, because these medicines give the body energy that may last for several \r\n    hours, but the body soon pays the price for that energy by falling into \r\n    exhaustion. It is known that that which leads to harm that outweighs any \r\n    benefit, or leads only to harm (with no benefit) is not permitted by the \r\n    texts of sharee&lsquo;ah and Islamic principles.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Maraaqi<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In sharee&lsquo;ah, everything that leads to harm is forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Summarised from a Master&rsquo;s thesis entitled <i>al-Nawaazil fil \r\n    Ashribah<\/i> (p. 237-240 by Shaykh Zayn al-&lsquo;Aabideen ibn Shaykh ibn Azwayn, \r\n    supervised by Shaykh Sa&lsquo;d ibn Turki al-Khathlaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]79072[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information on the ruling on saying &ldquo;what is the \r\n    shar&lsquo;i view?&rdquo; Please see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]72841[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11057","question_id":"11057","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Making a person taller is done by means of hormones and \r\n      treating the factors that have made one short, or it may be done by means \r\n      of surgery.

As for \r\n    merely wanting to be taller, that is not sufficient justification for \r\n    transgressing this sanctity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And there is evidence to indicate that it is haraam to break \r\n    bones in such cases, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Breaking the bone of the dead person is like breaking it when he \r\n    was alive.&rdquo; This hadeeth likens breaking the bones of a dead person to \r\n    breaking the bones of a living person, which indicates that the prohibition \r\n    on breaking the bones of the living person is a definitive and established \r\n    ruling, hence breaking the bones of a dead person is likened to it. What is \r\n    meant here is that both are haraam in principle, but they are not equally \r\n    haraam, because transgression against the bones of a dead person is not like \r\n    transgression against the bones of a living person in terms of qisaas \r\n    (retaliatory punishment) and diyah (blood money), according to scholarly \r\n    consensus.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Short stature is regarded as something normal among people \r\n    and is not regarded as a defect in most cases, and surgery to change a \r\n    characteristic that is regarded as normal may come under the heading of \r\n    changing the creation of Allah, which the texts forbid, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we assume that shortness is not a normal characteristic, \r\n    it cannot be treated and changed into a normal characteristic. That is \r\n    because the appearance of the body will not be in the right proportions. It \r\n    is the lower limbs that will be lengthened whilst the rest of the body \r\n    remains short, which will make the body appear abnormal, so this surgery \r\n    will not change an abnormal characteristic into a normal characteristic, and \r\n    if the lengthening is not a remedy to the deformity then there is no shar&lsquo;i \r\n    justification for something that involves breaking healthy bones \r\n    unnecessarily.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is mentioned above of serious complications in this \r\n    surgery, such as infection, severe chronic pain, and fibrosis of muscles, \r\n    along with the possibility that the function of the muscles may be impaired, \r\n    let alone the fact that the body&rsquo;s appearance will not be in the right \r\n    proportions &ndash; all of this means that it is not permissible to go ahead with \r\n    it merely because one wants to look better and add a few centimetres to \r\n    one&rsquo;s height.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Jaraahaat al-Tajmeeliyyah<\/i>, p. 322&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, you should not worry about being short and you \r\n    should understand that a person&rsquo;s true beauty resides in his attitude and \r\n    good conduct.

They do not, in \r\n    principle, cause disease to the one who is immunised. What happens of \r\n    side-effects as a result of being immunised cannot be compared to the future \r\n    benefits, in sha Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-&lsquo;Arabiyyah al-&lsquo;Aalamiyyah<\/i> it says: \r\n    Protection or active immunisation is another word for vaccination. The \r\n    vaccine contains a substance that can strengthen the immunity of the body \r\n    and enable it to produce antibodies to a specific contagious disease. These \r\n    antibodies protect the individual if he catches the live agent that causes \r\n    the disease. The vaccine contains a strong substance that is enough to \r\n    stimulate production of antibodies but it is not strong enough to cause the \r\n    actual disease. Most vaccines contain the bacteria that causes the disease \r\n    or dead viruses; some others contain living pathogens but they are in a \r\n    weakened state that cannot cause the disease. These vaccines contain toxins \r\n    that are secreted by the pathogens that cause the disease and these toxins \r\n    are treated chemically so that they give immunity without causing disease.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The ruling on immunisation depends on the ruling on the \r\n    substance used in it and the effects it has.

That is \r\n    because they are included in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him): &ldquo;Seek medical treatment.&rdquo; So they come under the same \r\n    rulings as medical treatment. Some fuqaha&rsquo; had a problem with the idea of \r\n    vaccinations and said: The vaccination is a reduced level of sickness that \r\n    is transferred to the body so that the body will be able to fight the real \r\n    sickness (so that the body gets used to resisting sickness). They said: How \r\n    can we allow introducing sickness into the body? But the more correct view \r\n    is that there is nothing wrong with doing that; rather it is a righteous act \r\n    because the introduction of harm in this case does not result in further \r\n    harm; rather it serves a purpose which is to protect the one who receives \r\n    this vaccination from severe illness.

Many Muslims experience acute embarrassment when there is a need for \r\n    a female doctor to treat a wife, daughter or sister, but only a male doctor \r\n    can be found. Hence if a Muslim woman studies this noble profession she will \r\n    be fulfilling a major shar&lsquo;i interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said: There is no doubt that learning medicine is a communal \r\n    obligation (fard kifaayah) as the scholars stated, because the people&rsquo;s \r\n    interests cannot be served except by means of it, and that which is \r\n    essential to serving the people&rsquo;s interests comes under the heading of \r\n    communal obligations even though it is not an act of worship. Hence the \r\n    scholars said, when listing their general principles: Professions that \r\n    people are in need of are communal obligations -- such as manufacturing, \r\n    carpentry, blacksmithing, and so on. If there is no one to practice these \r\n    professions so as to meet the needs of the Muslims, they become communal \r\n    obligations upon the Muslims. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that we say: it is obligatory for Muslims in Muslim \r\n    countries to learn and practice medicine so that they will have no need of \r\n    other doctors who are Christians and so on.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala ad-Darb<\/i> (tape 9)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that a female medical student should \r\n    seek an environment that is not mixed and she should choose a serious \r\n    academic environment. She should also adhere to Islamic rulings that pertain \r\n    to her study with regard to looking at or touching &lsquo;awrahs (private parts). \r\n    It is not permissible for her to do that except within the limits of study \r\n    and learning. Although looking at and touching &lsquo;awrahs is basically haraam, \r\n    nowadays it is not possible to learn medicine properly except by means of \r\n    theoretical and practical studies. In order to fulfil this shar&lsquo;i need for \r\n    female Muslim doctors, it is permissible for a female student to look at and \r\n    touch the private parts of men and women for the purpose of learning. This \r\n    ruling applies equally to both male and female students.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He is studying in the faculty of gynaecology and obstetrics, \r\n    and there are some practical cases that the student is required to observe, \r\n    and this is required in order to pass this subject so that he can move to \r\n    the next stage. This causes problems for us. We hope that you can issue a \r\n    fatwa on this topic.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that it is obligatory to cover the \r\n    &lsquo;awrah for both men and women. The &lsquo;awrah for men is from the navel to the \r\n    knee. In the case of a woman, her entire body is &lsquo;awrah apart from the face \r\n    and hands when praying and when in ihram. If she can see non-mahram men and \r\n    they can see her, it is obligatory for her to cover her face and body, \r\n    whether that is in prayer or in ihram for Hajj or &lsquo;umrah. It is permissible \r\n    to uncover the &lsquo;awrah in the case of necessity and it is permissible to look \r\n    at it if a shar&lsquo;i interest will be served by that. That includes female and \r\n    male students looking at women during surgery that has to do with \r\n    gynaecology and obstetrics, so that they can pass this subject and move on \r\n    to the next stage, and so on until the students (both male and female) \r\n    graduate. The shar&lsquo;i interest which justifies the view that this is \r\n    permissible is having enough Muslim doctors, both male and female. If that \r\n    is forbidden among the Muslims, it will result in a need for male and female \r\n    doctors who are not Muslim, which will bring many negative consequences. \r\n    Islamic sharee&lsquo;ah seeks to achieve benefits and ward off harm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd ar-Razzaaq \r\n    &lsquo;Afeefi, Shaykh &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Ghadyaan.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, 24\/411, \r\n    412&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen thinks that looking \r\n    at &lsquo;awrahs for the purpose of learning medicine is permissible because \r\n    looking at &lsquo;awrahs is forbidden because of what it may lead to (and not in \r\n    and of itself), and as that is the case it may be permissible in the case of \r\n    need. And the need of Muslim societies for female doctors cannot be denied. \r\n    So it is permissible for male and female students to look at &lsquo;awrahs for the \r\n    purpose of learning medicine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the ruling on uncovering the woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;awrah for the \r\n    purpose of finding out the symptoms of illness? What is the ruling on female \r\n    students for whom the &lsquo;awrahs of female patients are uncovered for the \r\n    purpose of learning?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with a woman uncovering that which it \r\n    is obligatory for her to cover, for the purpose of medical treatment, \r\n    investigating symptoms and diagnosing disease, because that is a case of \r\n    necessity, and necessity makes such normally haraam things permissible. The \r\n    well-known principle of the scholars is that what is forbidden for what it \r\n    may lead to (and not in and of itself) may be permitted in cases of \r\n    necessity, and what is forbidden in and of itself may be permitted in cases \r\n    of extreme necessity. They (the scholars) gave several examples of that, \r\n    such as looking at that which it is not ordinarily permissible to look at of \r\n    a woman in the case of necessity; thus a suitor may look at that which it is \r\n    not ordinarily permissible to look at for the purpose of marriage. The same \r\n    applies in this case that our brother has asked us about.

Or is \r\n    it permissible to treat disease with impure substances when it does not \r\n    involve drinking it? Or is it is not permissible in all cases? In <i>\r\n    al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (11\/119) it says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maalikis regarded this ruling [the prohibition on \r\n    treating disease with najis and haraam substances] as being general in \r\n    application, including everything that is impure (najis) and haraam, whether \r\n    it is alcohol, dead meat (from an animal that was not slaughtered properly) \r\n    or anything else that Allah, may He be exalted, has forbidden, and whether \r\n    the means of treating disease is by drinking it or applying it to the body, \r\n    and whether it is used on its own or mixed with a permissible medicine. They \r\n    made one exception to that and regarded it as permissible to use it for \r\n    treating disease, which is when the method of treatment is by applying it to \r\n    the body and there is the fear that not doing it would lead to death, \r\n    whether the substance applied is najis or haraam, used on its own or mixed \r\n    with a permissible medicine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Hanbalis added to the category of haraam and impure \r\n    (najis) everything that is regarded as off-putting, such as the urine of \r\n    animals whose meat may be eaten and others, except the urine of camels, \r\n    which it is permissible to use for medical treatment.

Hence there are some scholars who granted a concession allowing \r\n    that, even though they did not allow drinking impure substances for the \r\n    purpose of medicinal treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (2\/88): With \r\n    regard to injections using haraam substances, the scholars said it is not \r\n    allowed unless it is necessary, because of the general meaning of the \r\n    prohibition on using haraam substances.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the injection is necessary, then the Hanafis and \r\n    Shaafa&lsquo;is allow injection because of necessity, if the necessity is because \r\n    there is fear for the patient&rsquo;s life and a skilled Muslim doctor has told \r\n    him that his recovery is dependent on treatment with the haraam substance, \r\n    on condition that he use only as much as is necessary. This was confirmed by \r\n    Ibn Hazm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maalikis say, and this is also an opinion of the \r\n    Hanbalis, that it is not permissible to apply to the body, inject or use for \r\n    medicinal purposes alcohol and impure substances, even if refraining from \r\n    doing so may lead to the patient dying, because the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah has not put healing for my ummah in \r\n    that which He has forbidden to them.&rdquo; And when mention was made to the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of nabeedh made for \r\n    medicinal purposes he said: &ldquo;It is not a remedy; rather it is a disease.&rdquo; \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What appears to be the case, and Allah knows best, is that \r\n    the issue of inserting urine or injecting the patient with it through the \r\n    vagina in the case of necessity is less serious, and the concession in such \r\n    cases is broader, but that is subject to conditions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That it be on the advice of a \r\n    Muslim doctor of good character who is trustworthy and skilled, and he knows \r\n    that this will lead to recovery.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That there is no permissible \r\n    remedy that could take its place.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That it be used only as much as \r\n    is necessary.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our companions \r\n    said: That is only permissible if the one who wants to apply this treatment \r\n    to himself is well versed in medicine, and he knows that there is nothing \r\n    else that could take its place, or he is told about that by a Muslim doctor \r\n    of good character; and one doctor&rsquo;s opinion is sufficient. &hellip; If the doctor \r\n    told you that it will speed up recovery, and that if it is not done recovery \r\n    will be delayed, then there are two opinions as to whether it is \r\n    permissible. Both opinions were narrated by al-Baghawi and he did not regard \r\n    one of them as stronger than the other.

You have done well by doing so, and we are enjoined \r\n    to commend the one who does well, and to praise his actions if they are \r\n    good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For our part, we are happy to answer your questions and \r\n    queries, not only about this matter, but about everything that you want to \r\n    know about this religion, or everything that you think you should know. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We would like you to pay attention to what we are going to \r\n    tell you, and we are sure that you are not just asking for fun, or to impugn \r\n    the rulings of the Islamic faith. We think that you are only asking because \r\n    you want to know more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We would like to answer your question by making a few points, \r\n    and we think that you are able to understand what we are saying.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What would you think if a woman came to offer you condolences \r\n    for the death of a relative of yours, wearing a swimsuit? Would you accept \r\n    that? We think that the answer would be no, it is not acceptable, because \r\n    the occasion requires the one who comes offering condolences to wear clothes \r\n    that suit the occasion, doesn&rsquo;t it? The question is: what is it that has \r\n    restricted this person&rsquo;s freedom of dress and requires him to wear one type \r\n    of clothing and not another? It is customs and traditions, is it not? So one \r\n    is not free to do whatever one wants in all circumstances, rather custom \r\n    sometimes prevents a person from doing something and puts some limits on his \r\n    freedom.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What would you think if a person was eating with you at the \r\n    same table, and during the meal he burped? Would you accept that from him? \r\n    We think that the answer will be no, this behaviour is not acceptable, \r\n    because this action is contrary to good table manners, is it not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Question: What is it that limits the freedom of this person \r\n    and prevents him from doing this action whilst eating? It is good taste and \r\n    manners, is it not? So a person is not free to do whatever he wants whilst \r\n    eating food with others, such as burping, sticking his fingers up his nose \r\n    and so on, because good taste requires certain things from him, and prevents \r\n    him from doing others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What do you think if a driver drives his car opposite to the \r\n    flow of traffic, or parks in a place where parking is not allowed? Would you \r\n    accept that from him? We think that the answer will be no, those actions are \r\n    not acceptable, because doing that is objectionable and unacceptable; the \r\n    right to drive is not based on his whims, and not all places are good to \r\n    park in, is that not so? Question: What is it that limited this driver&rsquo;s \r\n    freedom and prevents him from driving opposite to the flow of traffic and \r\n    prevents him from parking in that spot? It is the law, is it not? So a \r\n    person is not free even to drive his car however he wants or to park \r\n    wherever he wants, because the law dictates that the traffic should go a \r\n    certain way, and prevents parking in certain places.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you can see that customs and traditions, good taste and \r\n    the law all have some authority over people, by preventing them from doing \r\n    certain things and obliging them to do others. So it is nothing strange that \r\n    God or religion should have some authority over people. We see what our Lord \r\n    or our religion forbid to us, and we refrain from it and regard it as \r\n    prohibited. This is the issue in a nutshell. We think that you will \r\n    understand that the prohibition of the Lord and of religion is more \r\n    important than all the things we have mentioned, and it is more important to \r\n    pay heed and refrain from those things, because He is the Creator Who has \r\n    decreed that we should be His servants and we have accepted Him as our Lord, \r\n    legislator and ruler.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the Muslim student is ding by not going to the nightclub \r\n    and not drinking alcohol &ndash; he is only doing that for the sake of Allaah Who \r\n    has forbidden that to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, you are objecting to that Muslim student not going \r\n    to the nightclub and not enjoying himself with you. We ask you: Are there \r\n    any limits to this enjoyment or is it without limits? We will be more frank \r\n    with you: Would you accept for your girlfriend among the female students to \r\n    be the girlfriend of another student or a teacher? Would you accept for \r\n    someone else to be intimate with her as you are? We know about a lot of the \r\n    cases of murder that happen in secondary schools and colleges because of \r\n    such actions. There is no need to answer us, because we have seen and heard \r\n    and read about fights that often end in killing, and all of that is because \r\n    of competing to win the heart of a female student. Is that not so? So what \r\n    is the enjoyment that you are calling for? Why do you prohibit this kind of \r\n    enjoyment to students or teachers who want be intimate with the same female \r\n    student, and she may also want that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you go against sound human nature and the reality in which \r\n    you live, and accept for other students to be intimate with the female \r\n    student who you are in love with, would you agree for the same thing to \r\n    happen with your wife? We hope that you will not be angered by this \r\n    question, all we want to do is explain to you that there are contradictions \r\n    in your society, whereby you call for fun and enjoyment, but you limit it to \r\n    things that have to do with yourselves and your whims and desires, and if a \r\n    Muslim refuses to do that because of his religion, he is made a laughing \r\n    stock and criticized. Moreover, there is a reference to a similar question \r\n    in our religion. Do you know what that is? A young man came to our Prophet \r\n    Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him for \r\n    permission to commit fornication. Yes, he asked for permission to commit \r\n    fornication with the daughters and womenfolk of other people. Do you know \r\n    what our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \r\n    him? He said to him: &ldquo;Would you accept it for your mother? Would you accept \r\n    it for your sister? Would you accept it for your daughter?&rdquo; and each time \r\n    the young man said no, that he would not accept for anyone to commit \r\n    fornication with his mother, sister or daughter, and each time the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: &ldquo;And by the \r\n    same token, people do not accept it for their mothers, sisters or \r\n    daughters.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    prayed for him, and when he left him, fornication was the most hateful of \r\n    deeds in his mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You are calling this Muslim to have fun, and we have asked a \r\n    logical question: Would you accept for him to be intimate with your \r\n    girlfriend whom you love? Would you accept for him to be intimate with your \r\n    wife? Would you accept for him to be intimate with your daughter? We are \r\n    quite certain that the incidents where unfaithful wives are killed happen \r\n    because of the sound human nature that God has created in all people, \r\n    whereby people refuse that and denounce it strongly, even if that leads to \r\n    killing her or killing her and her lover, even if the end result is life \r\n    imprisonment or execution. An unfaithful girlfriend is definitely not like \r\n    an unfaithful wife, but even boyfriends do not accept for their girlfriends \r\n    to be available to all people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam brought rulings that are well-founded and most wise; \r\n    they are in the best interests of individuals, societies and states. When \r\n    Islam forbade sexual relations outside the framework of marriage, the aim \r\n    was so that societies would be pure in heart and body. It is sufficient for \r\n    you to know the huge numbers of those who are affected by sexually \r\n    transmitted diseases which are caused by sinful and perverse relationships, \r\n    concerning the prohibition of which there should be no difference among \r\n    various religions. How many victims of AIDS are there? How many have been \r\n    infected? How do those of them who have not died live? It is a wretched life \r\n    and a terrible death that a person leads himself to when he pays with his \r\n    life for a few moments of pleasure. Islam brought that which protects the \r\n    Muslim&rsquo;s religious commitment, heart and body, so the Muslim refuses to do \r\n    haraam (forbidden) things and is content with that which Allaah has decreed \r\n    for him, for He knows best what is in the best interests of people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should note that there is nothing in this world to feel \r\n    regret for missing out on. For the Muslim, this world is a prison, and his \r\n    Paradise and true enjoyment are in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, \r\n    his paradise is in this world only, where he enjoys its delights, then his \r\n    ultimate fate will be humiliation and loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) told us that when he said: &ldquo;This world is a prison for the \r\n    believer and a paradise for the kaafir.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim (2956).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our scholars explained it to us as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Every believer who is imprisoned in this world and deprived \r\n    of forbidden and abhorrent whims and desires is obliged to do difficult acts \r\n    of obedience, but when he dies he will be relieved of that, and he will \r\n    attain what Allaah has prepared for him of eternal delights and complete \r\n    serenity that is not disturbed by anything.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;As for the kaafir (disbeliever), he has whatever he gets of \r\n    that in this world, although it is very little and it is disturbed by many \r\n    problems and distresses, but when he dies, he will end up in eternal torment \r\n    and misery.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh al-Nawawi<\/i> (18\/93).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We hope that you will think about this matter and we hope \r\n    that it will be the key that opens your heart to the truth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Who told you that there is no enjoyment in Islam? We do enjoy \r\n    ourselves, but it is with what Allaah has permitted to us. We enjoy much \r\n    more than you enjoy &ndash; and think it is enjoyment &ndash; because there is no \r\n    enjoyment in a haraam thing, rather true enjoyment is in permissible things. \r\n    Sin is followed by a sense of regret, and the one who does it can never be \r\n    happy. Look at your own situation to see the truth of this.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you enjoy intimacy with one wife, we can enjoy intimacy \r\n    with four wives. What is the matter with your people who denounce us night \r\n    and day and insult our religion for allowing us this pleasure?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We enjoy life with our sons and daughters, hence you will see \r\n    that Muslim families are large and have many children. What kind of \r\n    enjoyment do you have in this respect? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We enjoy the love of our mothers and fathers. Do you know the \r\n    reality of the relationship of one of you with his mother and father?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We enjoy delicious, permissible food, and we enjoy delicious \r\n    permissible drinks, and the same may be said about many other aspects of \r\n    life. What matters is that Allaah has permitted it to us and allowed us to \r\n    enjoy it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is sufficient for us that we are happy and enjoy that to \r\n    which Allaah has guided us, which is that we should follow the right path \r\n    with which Allaah is pleased, and which was followed by the noble Prophets \r\n    before us. This is the happiness of which millions of people are deprived, \r\n    who accept for themselves to worship rocks or idols, or humans like them. \r\n    Allaah has told us that the lives of these people will never be pleasant, \r\n    and their hearts will never be at rest, because they have forsaken belief in \r\n    the Oneness (Tawheed) of their Lord Who created them, and they have \r\n    associated other gods with Him, so Allaah punishes them in this world with \r\n    anxiety and He will punish them with constriction of their graves, then with \r\n    the harshness of the gathering (on the Day of Judgement) and their ultimate \r\n    fate will be Hell in which they will abide forever.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you want to understand the truth of these words, then read \r\n    the stories of those among your own people, or others, who entered Islam. \r\n    Look at the great changes that occurred in their lives, and look at the \r\n    great happiness that they enjoy now. This is the enjoyment that you should \r\n    seek. Just as you call on us to have fun and enjoyment, we call you \r\n    sincerely to come and find enjoyment with us, and follow the path of \r\n    happiness, and taste true happiness that will be with you as you go to sleep \r\n    and as you wake up, and will never leave you, until you enter your grave, \r\n    until your Lord admits you to the abode of happiness, which is Paradise as \r\n    vast as the heavens and the earth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah our Lord to guide you to knowledge of the \r\n    truth, and not to cause you to die except in the religion with which He \r\n    ended the divine messages.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the source of strength.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11072","question_id":"11072","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      First of all we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to bless your \r\n      efforts and make them weigh in the balance of your good deeds; we ask \r\n      Allah to help all the Muslims to strive for this religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then we advise you to pay attention to some important matters \r\n    in calling this person to Islam and teaching him its rulings, such as the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is essential to start with him by teaching him the meaning \r\n    of the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith), because it is the key to \r\n    Islam and summarises it. Explain to him Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah), \r\n    which is the basis of Muslim success in this world and in the Hereafter, so \r\n    that his heart will become attached to Allah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted. Teach him that absolute servitude is only to Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, and submission to Him means obeying Him and ridding \r\n    oneself of all burdens of whims and desires.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the useful books which explain these matters is <i>\r\n    Ta&lsquo;reef &lsquo;Aam li Deen al-Islam<\/i> (A General Introduction to Islam) by \r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Ali al-Tantaawi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to direct him towards the Book of Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, and encourage him to read it, ponder it and think \r\n    about its meanings, for it is light and guidance that Allah sent down for \r\n    mankind, with which He grants them peace of mind and makes them steadfast in \r\n    faith. It is all blessing and goodness and reward, and it has a great impact \r\n    on hearts and minds that is experienced by everyone who reads it. Allah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>Indeed, \r\n    there has come to you from All&acirc;h a light (Prophet Muhammad) and a plain Book \r\n    (this Qur'&acirc;n). <\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Wherewith All&acirc;h guides all \r\n    those who seek His Good Pleasure to ways of peace, and He brings them out of \r\n    darkness by His Will unto light and guides them to a Straight Way (Isl&acirc;mic \r\n    Monotheism)<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:15-16]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should teach him some of the Qur&rsquo;aan and a little of how \r\n    it was revealed and some of its soorahs and verses.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then teach him something about our Prophet Muhammad \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), about his birth, how he grew up \r\n    and how his mission began; about how the call to this great religion \r\n    started. Then tell him about his migration to Madinah and how he put up with \r\n    all kinds of hardship for the sake of conveying guidance and truth to \r\n    mankind. Then tell him about the character of the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him), that we have access to today through his Sunnah \r\n    and the saheeh hadeeths. Anyone who wants to read about this noble Messenger \r\n    from the most trustworthy sources should read the <i>Saheehs<\/i> of \r\n    al-Bukhaari and Muslim, and books of the Prophetic Sunnah in general and \r\n    books of Seerah (Prophet&rsquo;s biography). In these books he will find details \r\n    of the life and teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Books that we recommend for this purpose include:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Mukhtasar Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> by \r\n    al-Zubaydi<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim<\/i> by \r\n    al-Mundhiri<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Riyad al-Saaliheen<\/i> by al-Nawawi<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Raheeq al-Makhtoom<\/i> by al-Mubaarakfoori&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of these have been translated into English and have been \r\n    published.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    [All these titles are available from Darussalam Publishers, \r\n    Riyadh, KSA]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You also have to teach him a little about the five pillars of \r\n    Islam: the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith), salaah (prayer), zakaah \r\n    (obligatory charity), sawm (fasting) and Hajj (pilgrimage). And teach him \r\n    about the six pillars of faith: belief in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His \r\n    Messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, both good and bad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you set aside for this Muslim brother some sessions to \r\n    talk about each of these pillars, and read with him some books that speak of \r\n    them, that will be very helpful and beneficial, in sha Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Try to teach these pillars without going into details of \r\n    differences of scholarly opinion. Stick to the main principles that all \r\n    Muslims are agreed upon. Point out to him that there are some differences \r\n    concerning some details, but they are not blameworthy differences and they \r\n    have not divided the Muslims, praise be to Allah; rather these are genuine \r\n    differences based on different interpretations of the shar&lsquo;i texts and \r\n    occurred for a reason that Allah has decreed by His wisdom; the one who gets \r\n    it right will have two rewards and the one who gets it wrong will have one \r\n    reward.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another useful book concerning this matter is the book \r\n    entitled Ma la yasa&lsquo; al-Muslim Jahluhu (What the Muslim cannot afford to be \r\n    unaware of) by Dr &lsquo;Abd-Allah al-Muslih and Dr Salaah al-Saawi. It is a very \r\n    useful book that describes the main aims of Islam and its principal \r\n    rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of your teaching him should be devoted to explaining \r\n    prohibitions in Islam, so that he will understand that the boundaries of \r\n    prohibitions in Islam are quite small, and everything beyond that is \r\n    permissible, in sha Allah. He should be aware of the major sins on which \r\n    there was consensus that they are haraam: shirk (associating others with \r\n    Allah); witchcraft or magic; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden to be \r\n    killed except in cases dictated by Islamic law; consuming riba (usury); \r\n    consuming the wealth of orphans; disobeying one's parents; and so on. It is \r\n    also a good idea for him to learn about some of the minor sins, so that he \r\n    can avoid them and keep away from them too, especially since one who comes \r\n    to Islam is usually very sincere and motivated to adhere completely to the \r\n    rulings of Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You can make use of the book <i>al-Kabaa&rsquo;ir<\/i> (Major Sins) \r\n    by Imam al-Dhahabi [available in English from International Islamic \r\n    Publishing House (IIPH), Riyadh, KSA]. It is a very useful and comprehensive \r\n    book on this topic.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also very important to explain to him that our Islamic \r\n    religion is a religion that encourages good interactions with people; it \r\n    encourages the best and noblest of attitudes and characteristics and it \r\n    regards a good attitude (towards people) as one of the things that are most \r\n    effective in helping a person to enter Paradise. Islam teaches that by \r\n    having a good attitude (towards people), one may attain the level of one who \r\n    fasts and prays at night. Truthfulness, honesty, sincerity, keeping one&rsquo;s \r\n    word, tolerance, generosity, kindness, compassion and other good \r\n    characteristics are all part of the essence of religion. That is summed up \r\n    in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): &ldquo;I \r\n    have been sent to complete noble (attitudes and) characteristics.&rdquo; (Narrated \r\n    by al-Bukhaari in <i>al-Adab al-Mufrad<\/i>, 273; and by al-Haakim in <i>\r\n    al-Mustadrak<\/i>, 2\/670 &ndash; he classed it as saheeh and al-Dhahabi agreed with \r\n    him. It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>al-Silsilah al-Saheehah<\/i>, \r\n    45.)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the most important things you should pay attention to \r\n    when teaching him is the issue of raqaa&rsquo;iq (heart softening reports etc) and \r\n    actions of the heart (i.e., spiritual matters). The heart is like a garden; \r\n    if a person does not take care of it, it will be taken over by thorns and \r\n    weeds. The heart (in a spiritual sense) becomes clean by learning of the \r\n    greatness of Allah, may He be exalted, and developing the fear of His \r\n    punishment, hope for His reward, love for Him, may He be glorified, and \r\n    longing to meet Him. The Muslim should also learn about sincerity (towards \r\n    Allah), repentance, humbleness, asceticism, piety, respecting the sacred \r\n    limits, patience, contentment, gratitude, certainty of faith, and putting \r\n    one&rsquo;s trust in Allah. All of these are important acts of worship of the \r\n    heart that one has to pay attention to and take care of. The one who pays \r\n    attention to learning their reality will find great delight and joy in \r\n    faith; the one who neglects them is neglecting a great deal of good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The books of the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim teach about \r\n    actions of the heart and shed light on these matters. One of the most \r\n    important of these books is <i>Madaarij al-Saalikeen<\/i>. But we recommend \r\n    reading its abridged version by Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Mun&lsquo;im al-&lsquo;Izzi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, it is also important to teach him something about \r\n    the falseness of other religions, especially the religion that he used to \r\n    follow, so as to increase his certainty about Islam and to protect himself \r\n    against any specious argument that he may encounter. Then he will see how \r\n    great is the favour that Allah bestowed upon him when He guided him to Islam \r\n    and the true religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We think that these ideas are sufficient to help in teaching \r\n    Islam. Although they may appear to be numerous and lengthy and difficult, it \r\n    is up to you how long or short to make them. You can limit it to what is \r\n    appropriate to the learner and to you, or you can make it longer if you have \r\n    enough time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the difference in languages between you and him is \r\n    preventing you from reaching the desired goal, you have no choice but to \r\n    seek the help of someone who can translate for you, or you can use books and \r\n    audiovisual materials that are translated into both Arabic and English.

If this is their state even \r\n    though they are promoting falsehood and striving for the sake of falsehood, \r\n    then how about the Muslim whom Allaah has blessed with guidance and taught \r\n    him the path of truth? Undoubtedly he, of all people, should be striving and \r\n    making the effort, sacrificing that which is most dear to him, in order to \r\n    spread the religion of Islam and teach and guide people, whether they are \r\n    Christians or others. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Advance cautiously, until you reach their open space, then \r\n    invite them to Islam, and tell them of their duties before Allaah.

But it is a path that needs provision, namely \r\n    knowledge, patience and certainty of faith. You have done well to ask about \r\n    the way to specialize in debating with the Christians, because some people \r\n    indulge in this field without preparation, and that may lead to his putting \r\n    his opponent off or making him cling more steadfastly to his falsehood, or \r\n    it may lead to him becoming weak himself and being filled with doubts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence the one who wants to \r\n    strive for the sake of Allaah and call these people to Islam and debate with \r\n    them should pay attention to a number of matters:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Studying sound &lsquo;aqeedah \r\n    from reliable sources, directly from scholars if possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Acquiring shar&rsquo;i \r\n    knowledge which will correct his worship and interactions with others, \r\n    because learning this is an individual obligation, and it takes precedence \r\n    over the duty of calling others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We have previously \r\n    explained the program that the seeker of knowledge should follow and the \r\n    most important books that he needs at the initial stage.

Not a day goes by when someone does not enter Islam, and each and \r\n    every one of them has a story. They have no worldly interests to be served \r\n    by entering Islam, rather they all entered Islam out of conviction and with \r\n    firm belief that it is the true religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Although we would like you \r\n    and your family to be guided, we hope that they will not be an obstacle that \r\n    prevents you from being guided to this religion. Remember that the Day of \r\n    Resurrection will inevitably come, in which every person will say &ldquo;Myself, \r\n    myself.&rdquo; On that Day a man will flee from his own brother, mother and \r\n    father, and each of them will have enough concerns of his own to make him \r\n    indifferent to others. So hasten to save yourself first, then pay attention \r\n    to your family and strive to guide them. Do not let anyone come between you \r\n    and true guidance. On an airplane, in the event of an emergency, they say to \r\n    put the oxygen mask on your own face first, then turn to those beside you, \r\n    i.e., save yourself, then save those who are next to you, even if it is the \r\n    dearest of people to you. In our religion, Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire \r\n    (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones&rdquo; [al-Tahreem 66:6]<\/i>. So you have to \r\n    look after yourself first; hasten and do not hesitate to join the blessed \r\n    caravan led by the Prophets and Messengers, and remember that you will be \r\n    following the truth and the straight path that was travelled by that elite \r\n    of Allaah&rsquo;s creation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>According to our religion, \r\n    no person&rsquo;s Islam is complete unless he believes in all the Prophets and \r\n    Messengers, and in their Books that Allaah revealed to them, and whoever \r\n    attribute shortcomings any one of them is beyond the pale of Islam. Other \r\n    religions attribute shortcomings to some of the Prophets and Messengers; all \r\n    of their followers do not believe in our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). Look at the great difference between our \r\n    religion, which enjoins us to believe in that elite of Allaah&rsquo;s creation and \r\n    to venerate and respect them, and others who disbelieve in our Messenger and \r\n    others, and who attribute shortcomings to some of the Prophets and \r\n    Messengers, and accuse them of things that one would be ashamed to mention. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This religion has been \r\n    exposed to a great deal of criticism and misrepresentation in the media &ndash; \r\n    newspapers, radio and TV &ndash; but by the grace of Allaah its followers have \r\n    only become more committed and stronger in conviction, because they realize \r\n    that the criticism and misrepresentation are based on whims and desires, \r\n    ignorance and hatred, and they have no basis in knowledge. Despite all the \r\n    hostility and propaganda against Islam, we see thousands entering the \r\n    religion of Allaah in crowds, from the countries where the extremists are \r\n    leading the campaign of criticism and misrepresentation against Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Look at an example of that. \r\n    In America, after the events of September 11<sup>th<\/sup>, the number of \r\n    those who entered Islam in America reached 25,000, which was the highest \r\n    number in its history. This happened despite the accusations and \r\n    misrepresentations of Islam that are produced by the government and by many \r\n    foundations and organizations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We would like to reassure \r\n    you that you will never find anything in Islam that may cause confusion. The \r\n    rulings and laws of Allaah are wise; Allaah has prescribed them to be \r\n    suitable for all times and places. On this website we receive many letters \r\n    from people who are hesitant to enter Islam because of what they have heard \r\n    of accusations and misrepresentations about the rulings of Islam, but we \r\n    have answered them and soon truth became clear to them, then those whom \r\n    Allaah wanted to guide and save from doom did not hesitate to declare their \r\n    Islam and submit to this religion and its rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>7.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In this religion there is \r\n    that which will make your faith strong and increase it day by day. Faith in \r\n    Islam is increased by means of acts of obedience. In Islam there are many \r\n    ways to make your faith flourish and continue, if you do these acts of \r\n    obedience. Do not let this be a barrier that prevents you from entering \r\n    Islam. There are many verses in the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan and we are certain that \r\n    reading every verse will increase your faith, and every rak&rsquo;ah that you pray \r\n    will cause your faith to grow. The same applies to fasting, &lsquo;umrah, Hajj, \r\n    charity, helping the needy and other kinds of good deeds. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>8.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hasten to save yourself and \r\n    join this caravan; board the ship of salvation, and do not hesitate.

We ask Him to help you to do \r\n    that which is good and is in your best spiritual and worldly interests.

They are righteous believers who believed \r\n    in the Oneness of God (Tawheed); they believed that Jesus was a great \r\n    Messenger who was sent by God, and they believed in other Messengers such as \r\n    Abraham and Moses.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for those who believed in Jesus (peace be upon him) then \r\n    believed in Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), they \r\n    are of a high status, and will have a double reward, as our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Those who deviated from Tawheed (pure monotheism) and \r\n    believed that Jesus was God or the son of God, or they devoted some forms of \r\n    worship to him such as prayer and supplication. This is going against the \r\n    teachings of Jesus and other Messengers, and following the distortions that \r\n    the priests and monks introduced into the true religion that was brought by \r\n    Jesus from God.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, those who heard the Message of Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but did not believe in it or \r\n    follow him, are going against the way of the Muslims and are going against \r\n    the teachings of Jesus (peace be upon him), because he foretold the coming \r\n    of his brother Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This opinion about the Christians is well established and \r\n    does not stem from the Crusades or the oppression of the colonialists and \r\n    their aggression against Muslim lands.

If anyone denies that this Qur&rsquo;aan was revealed from \r\n    God, or mocks it, he is a kaafir, because the Qur'aan was revealed from \r\n    Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for jihad, it will remain in effect until the Day of \r\n    Resurrection. Its aim is to spread the call of truth to all of mankind and \r\n    free man from the oppressive forces that conceal the light from him and \r\n    prevent him from thinking about the truth, and subject him to rules that go \r\n    against the rulings of God. The aim of jihad is not to force anyone to enter \r\n    Islam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;There is no compulsion in religion&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:256]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you mention about the Lord and God and the Creator \r\n    indicates that your fitrah (basic human nature) and your reasoning are \r\n    sound. This is what the Muslims believe. The Lord is God (Allaah) and He is \r\n    the Creator; there is no creator but Him and no lord but Him, and no one \r\n    deserves to be worshipped except Him. The Creator, the Provider, the \r\n    Controller, is Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god, and it is not \r\n    permissible for us to worship anyone but Him. This God cannot be like a \r\n    human being, having a son or a wife; exalted be Allaah above that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, this God cannot be incarnated in human form, \r\n    eating, drinking, feeling hunger and thirst, being beaten and crucified.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslim belief is easy and is in accordance with reason and \r\n    logic: there is a Creator and created beings. The Creator is Allaah, may He \r\n    be exalted, and the created things are everything besides Him, heavens, \r\n    earth, sun, moon, humans and jinn. By His Mercy, Allaah sent Messengers to \r\n    mankind, to call them to Allaah and show them the right way. Among these \r\n    Messengers were Nooh (Noah), Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosa (Moses), &lsquo;Eesa \r\n    (Jesus) and Muhammad, may the blessings and peace of Allaah be upon them \r\n    all. Allaah supported these Messengers with signs, which were miraculous \r\n    things, the like of which other people could not produce, which were \r\n    appropriate to the time and place in which each Messenger was sent. Some \r\n    were thrown into the fire and not harmed by it, such as Ibraaheem (Abraham); \r\n    some brought the dead back to life and healed the sick by Allaah&rsquo;s Leave, \r\n    such as &lsquo;Eesa (Jesus); one was given the Qur&rsquo;aan and challenged all the most \r\n    eloquent Arabs to produce a single soorah like it, but they could not do it. \r\n    That was Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah \r\n    caused inanimate objects and animals to speak to him, and the stone in his \r\n    hand glorified Allaah, and the camel complained to him about being given too \r\n    much work to do, and there were many other miracles.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the wise man thinks about what is keeping the Christians \r\n    from believing that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a Messenger from God, and \r\n    that he is like Abraham, Zacharias and John (peace be upon them), this will \r\n    put an end to the problem, as reason is in agreement with the fitrah (sound \r\n    human nature) and revelation. Jesus (peace be upon him) called people to God \r\n    and foretold the coming of Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him). His enemies tried to kill him, but God saved him and he was not \r\n    crucified or killed, rather one of his companions was caused to look like \r\n    him, as the Qur&rsquo;aan says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it \r\n    appeared so to them the resemblance of &lsquo;Eesa (Jesus) was put over another \r\n    man (and they killed that man)&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:157]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They all believe that Allaah (God) is the Lord and Creator, \r\n    the only One to be worshipped, and they believe in His noble Messengers such \r\n    as Ibraaheem, Moosa, &lsquo;Eesa and Muhammad, may the blessing and peace of \r\n    Allaah be upon them all.

For example, when he was a \r\n    kaafir, a man proposed to a woman that she should be his wife and she \r\n    agreed, and they thought that this was a marriage contract, then the man and \r\n    woman become Muslim. In this case we say that their marriage contract is \r\n    valid and does not need to be renewed, and the children that they have had \r\n    together belong to them, unless the wife is not permissible for the husband \r\n    when they become Muslims, such as if he was a Magian and married his sister \r\n    &ndash; because the Magians regard marriage to mahrams as permissible. If he \r\n    married his sister when he was a kaafir then he became Muslim, and she also \r\n    became Muslim, then they must be separated, because the woman is not \r\n    permissible for the man.

All that you have to do is to utter \r\n    the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith), which is the key to Islam and \r\n    the summary and foundation of the faith. So say: <i>Ashhadu an laa ilaaha \r\n    ill-Allaah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool-Allaah<\/i> (I bear witness that \r\n    there is no god except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah), then do ghusl (full ablution, washing your entire \r\n    body) with the intention of purifying yourself for prayer, and practice all \r\n    the rituals of Islam, the greatest of which is prayer, which connects a \r\n    person with his Lord.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We would like to point out a number of things to you:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; You say, &ldquo;I love her so much that I am willing to embrace \r\n    Islam.&rdquo; Although the motive for your entering Islam may be your desire to \r\n    marry a Muslim woman at this stage, when you become Muslim, learn more about \r\n    this religion and practise it sincerely in your life, then your conviction \r\n    will become stronger, your intention will become pure, and you will become \r\n    more sincere towards Allaah and become fully convinced of Islam&rsquo;s validity, \r\n    for nothing can cleanse and purify the soul but that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; You say &ldquo;We have always been good friends and gone to the \r\n    same college&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please note that one of the basic aims of Islamic sharee&rsquo;ah \r\n    is to preserve people&rsquo;s honour. Islam has enjoined many regulations in order \r\n    to achieve this basic aim, one of which is the prohibition on free mixing \r\n    between men and women even in the noblest of places and when seeking the \r\n    highest of objectives. One of the teachings of Islam is that men should be \r\n    separated from women in the mosque. Muslim narrated in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> \r\n    (440) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best \r\n    rows for men are those at the front and the worst are those at the back, and \r\n    the best rows for women are those at the back and the worst are those at the \r\n    front.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>Sharh Muslim <\/i>(4\/159): What is meant \r\n    by the worst rows for men and women are those that bring less reward, are \r\n    lower in status and furthest removed from achieving the aims of sharee&rsquo;ah. \r\n    The best rows are the opposite of that. The best rows for women who attend \r\n    prayers with men are the last rows, because they are further away from \r\n    mixing with men, seeing them and becoming attracted to them when seeing \r\n    their movements, hearing their words and so on. The front rows are \r\n    criticized for the opposite reasons. And Allaah knows best. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Contact between two who love one another in a manner that is \r\n    not Islamically acceptable is a serious problem. In this case it is not \r\n    permissible for the man to contact the woman or the woman to contact the \r\n    man, and say that he wants to marry her. Rather he should inform her wali \r\n    (guardian) that he wants to marry her, or she should tell her wali that she \r\n    wants to marry him, as &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) did when he \r\n    offered his daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and &lsquo;Uthmaan (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with them both).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the woman gets in touch directly with the man, this is \r\n    a source of fitnah (temptation).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>As&rsquo;ilat al-Baab il-Maftoohah<\/i>, \r\n    question no. 868.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; You say: &ldquo;but we do not want to elope.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We appreciate this \r\n    approach which tells us of your good attitude and sound mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; You say: &ldquo;I would like to marry her as she is a wonderful \r\n    person, kind, loving, intelligent and pious.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This indicates that you are keen to marry one who is fit to \r\n    be a good example to your children and will strive to be easy going with \r\n    you. The good characteristics that you have mentioned are some of those \r\n    which Islam has described as motives for marriage. It is narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Saheehayn<\/i> and elsewhere from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their \r\n    beauty and their religious commitment.

If a kaafir becomes Muslim, Allaah \r\n    forgives him for everything that he did when he was a kaafir, and he becomes \r\n    cleansed of sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from \r\n    disbelief), their past will be forgiven.

The fatty \r\n    acids in pork are also of an unusual formation, when compared with the fatty \r\n    acids in other types of food, which makes them more easily absorbed by the \r\n    body, thus increasing cholesterol levels.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lrm;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Pork meat and pork fat \r\n    contribute to the spread of cancers of the colon, rectum, prostate and \r\n    blood.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lrm;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Pork meat and pork fat \r\n    contribute to obesity and related diseases that are difficult to treat.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lrm;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Eating pork leads to scabies, \r\n    allergies and stomach ulcers.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lrm;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Eating pork causes lung \r\n    infections which result from tapeworms, lungworms and microbial infections \r\n    of the lungs.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most serious danger of eating pork is that pork contains \r\n    tapeworms which may grow to a length of 2-3 meters. The growth of the eggs \r\n    of these worms in the human body may lead to insanity and hysteria if they \r\n    grow in the area of the brain. If they grow in the region of the heart that \r\n    may lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks. Another kind of worm that \r\n    is to be found in pork is the trichinosis worm that cannot be killed by \r\n    cooking, the growth of which in the body may lead to paralysis and skin \r\n    rashes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The doctors have confirmed that tapeworm disease is regarded \r\n    as one of the serious diseases that may result from eating pork. It may \r\n    develop in the small intestine and after several months may grow into a \r\n    large worm whose body is composed of a thousand segments, with a length of \r\n    4-10 meters, which lives alone in the intestine of the infected person and \r\n    part of it may appear when he defecates. When the pig swallows and ingests \r\n    its eggs, they enter the tissues and muscles in the form of larvae sacs \r\n    containing fluid and the head of the tapeworm. When a person eats infected \r\n    pork, the larva turns into a complete worm in the intestine. These worms \r\n    cause weakness and vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to a specific type of \r\n    anaemia, which may in turn cause nervous problems. In some cases the larvae \r\n    may reach the brain, causing convulsions, increased pressure within the \r\n    brain, epilepsy and even paralysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eating pork that is not thoroughly cooked may also lead to \r\n    trichinosis (infestation with a hairlike nematode worm). When these \r\n    parasites reach the small intestine, three to five days later many larvae \r\n    appear which enter the intestine and reach the blood, from which they reach \r\n    most of the tissues of the body. The larvae move to the muscles and form \r\n    cysts there, and the patient suffers intense muscle pains. The disease may \r\n    develop into infection of the cerebral membrane and brain, and infections of \r\n    the heart muscle, lungs, kidneys and nerves. It may be a fatal disease in \r\n    rare cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is well known that there are some diseases that are unique \r\n    to humans and are nor shared with any other animals except pigs, such as \r\n    rheumatism and joint pain. Allaah indeed spoke the truth when He said \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and \r\n    blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice \r\n    for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allaah&rsquo;s \r\n    Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).

So stop, research, look and think, objectively and fairly, seeking \r\n    only to find out the truth and follow it. I ask Allaah to guide you to that \r\n    which is best for you in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But even if we did not know about the harmful effects of \r\n    eating pork, this would not change our belief that it is haraam in the \r\n    slightest, or weaken our resolve to abstain from it. You know that when Adam \r\n    (peace be upon him) was expelled from the Garden, it was because he ate from \r\n    the tree from which Allaah forbade him to eat. We do not know anything about \r\n    that tree, and Adam did not need to enquire into the reason why it was \r\n    forbidden to eat from it. Rather it was sufficient for him, as it is \r\n    sufficient for us and for every believer, to know that Allaah has forbidden \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Look at some of the harmful effects of eating pork; look at \r\n    the research of the Fourth Annual Conference of Islamic Medicine, Kuwait \r\n    edition, p. 731 ff; and <i>al-Wiqaayah al-Sihhiyyah fi Daw&rsquo; al-Kitaab \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Sunnah<\/i> by Lu&rsquo;lu&rsquo;ah bint Saalih, p. 635 ff.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But we ask you once again: Isn&rsquo;t pork forbidden in the Old \r\n    Testament which forms part of your Holy Book?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Do not eat any detestable thing.

If you have any doubt then ask people and they will tell you. But \r\n    what we think we need to draw you attention to is some other things that are \r\n    also mentioned in your Holy Book, this time in the New Testament which tells \r\n    you that the rulings of the Torah still apply to you and cannot be changed. \r\n    Does&rsquo;t it say in the Bible that the Messiah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the \r\n    Prophets.

This is not the way of the wise.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    First of all you should understand the motives for jihad in \r\n    Islam, before asking about who deserves to be killed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These motives were summed up by Rib&rsquo;i ibn &lsquo;Aamir and other \r\n    companions of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    and were stated to Rustam, the commander of the Persian army, in the battle \r\n    of al-Qaadisiyyah, when he asked them one after another, for three \r\n    consecutive days before the battle took place: &ldquo;What is this that you have \r\n    brought?&rdquo; The answer came: &ldquo;Allaah has sent us to bring forth whomsoever He \r\n    wills from the worship of people to the worship of Allaah alone, from the \r\n    hardship of this world to its ease, from the injustice of other religions to \r\n    the justice of Islam. He sent His Messenger with His religion to His \r\n    creation. Whoever accepts it from us, we will accept it from him and will go \r\n    back; we will leave him and his land alone. Whoever refuses, we will fight \r\n    him until we end up in Paradise or in victory.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This religion has always &ndash; and continues to and always will &ndash; \r\n    be faced with resistance based on deviant beliefs and false ideologies, with \r\n    political, military, social, economic and racial obstacles. All these \r\n    obstacles combined may produce an attitude that rejects Islam altogether and \r\n    prevents people from following it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If verbal discussions \r\n    and debates, arguing in a way that is better, address deviant beliefs and \r\n    ideas, then the jihad movement addresses other, material obstacles, foremost \r\n    among which is the political power that is based on those combined factors. \r\n    It aims its strikes at the military and political powers that enslave the \r\n    people to something other than Allaah &ndash; i.e., rules them by means of \r\n    something other than the laws of Allaah &ndash; and that prevent them from \r\n    listening to the truth and following it with absolute freedom. Thus there is \r\n    a need for both da&rsquo;wah and jihad in order to face the real obstacles of \r\n    life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>Ma&rsquo;aalim fi&rsquo;l-Tareeq<\/i>, p. 59 ff&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it becomes clear that the basic principle of fighting as \r\n    prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah is jihad, and its purpose is that all religion \r\n    should be devoted to Allaah, and that the word of Allaah should be supreme. \r\n    Whoever tries to prevent that is to be fought, according to the consensus of \r\n    the Muslims. With regard to those who are not involved in resistance and \r\n    fighting &ndash; such as women, children, monks, old men, the blind, the \r\n    chronically ill, and so on &ndash; they are not to be killed, according to the \r\n    majority of scholars, unless they fight in word or deed&hellip; because we are to \r\n    fight those who fight us, if we want the religion of Allaah to prevail, as \r\n    Allaah says (Interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And fight in the way of \r\n    Allaah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits.

And the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Alcohol is the mother of all evils, the \r\n    greatest of major sins. Whoever drinks it may end up committing incest with \r\n    his mother, his maternal aunt and his paternal aunt.&rdquo; This hadeeth is hasan \r\n    on the basis of corroborating evidence, as stated by al-Albaani in <i>\r\n    al-Silsilah al-Saheehah<\/i>, 1853.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is some of the \r\n    evidence of the truthfulness of our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). And what he spoke of has indeed come to \r\n    pass. Have you not heard the news about that young man who came home drunk \r\n    and committed incest with his mother after imbibing intoxicants? He \r\n    threatened to kill himself if she did not do it, so she took pity on him and \r\n    did what he wanted. Then when he came to his senses and realized what had \r\n    happened, he killed himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Look at how things ended \r\n    after he drank alcohol. He committed incest with his mother, then he killed \r\n    himself. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica<\/i> states that most cases of \r\n    sexual assault against relatives such as sisters, mothers and daughters \r\n    happen under the influence of alcohol.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to those who say that drinking a little alcohol \r\n    is good for the heart, the response to that is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Modern research has proven that what is said about the \r\n    benefits of alcohol for the heart and that it dilates the arteries, is a \r\n    serious mistake. Alcohol does not dilate the arteries that bring nutrition \r\n    to the heart, as was thought in the past, rather it dilates the veins that \r\n    lie beneath the skin, whilst at the same time constricting the arteries, \r\n    because of the accumulation of fats and cholesterol in them. This \r\n    contributes to blood clots in the heart and angina, especially when it is \r\n    accompanied by smoking, which contributes to congestion and narrowing of the \r\n    arteries. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Alcohol also affects the muscle of the heart itself, when it \r\n    becomes poisoned and dysfunctional, especially after drinking beer that \r\n    contains cobalt, as when the heart becomes inflamed as a result of \r\n    exhaustion when burning alcohol. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; These supposed benefits to the heart may be attained by \r\n    means of things other than alcohol, the sinfulness and harmful effects of \r\n    which outweigh any good it may do or benefits it may bring.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; It has also been said that the benefits that alcohol is \r\n    said to bring to the heart come from the fruits and other substances from \r\n    which alcohol is made, such as grapes, apples, etc. Based on this, these \r\n    benefits may be obtained from these foods in the forms in which Allaah has \r\n    permitted them, without making alcohol from them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; We should weigh up those benefits to the heart &ndash; if they \r\n    are true &ndash; against the destructive effects that alcohol has on health, which \r\n    you can find out about by consulting any medical reference work that speaks \r\n    of addiction to alcohol and its destructive effects on man.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See for example: <i>al-Idmaan al-Kuhooli<\/i> by Dr Nabeel \r\n    Subhi al-Taweel, published by Mu&rsquo;sasat al-Risaalah, Beirut.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Abhaath wa A&rsquo;maal al-Mu&rsquo;tamar al-&lsquo;Aalami al-Thaalith \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Raabi&rsquo; &lsquo;an al-Tibb al-Islami<\/i>, published in \r\n    Kuwait, 1405 AH, 1407 AH.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Because some people in \r\n    the past &ndash; like some of their counterparts nowadays &ndash; thought that wine had \r\n    some benefits, Taariq ibn Suwayd al-Ja&rsquo;fi &ndash; one of the companions of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &ndash; came and asked \r\n    him about alcohol, and he forbade it. He said: &ldquo;We make it as a remedy&rdquo;. He \r\n    said: &ldquo;It is not a remedy, rather it is a disease.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim. This \r\n    is a sign that his Prophethood was true.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to your saying that &ldquo;Man has the sense to control \r\n    his actions and to stop drinking before he becomes intoxicated&rdquo;, this pays \r\n    no attention to the ways of the accursed Shaytaan, who seeks to distance \r\n    people from the Lord of the Worlds. It is also the words of one who does not \r\n    know &ndash; or perhaps chooses to ignore &ndash; how a drinker&rsquo;s relationship with \r\n    alcohol begins until he becomes drunk or addicted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Shaytaan gradually leads a person from a little to a lot, \r\n    from minor to major, from sin to kufr, as much as he can, step by step. This \r\n    is what the Lord of the Worlds refers to in Soorat al-Noor, where He says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;O you who believe! \r\n    Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the \r\n    footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al&#8209;Fahsha&rsquo; [i.e. to \r\n    commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al&#8209;Munkar [disbelief and \r\n    polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is \r\n    forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His \r\n    Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allaah \r\n    purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allaah is All&#8209;Hearer, \r\n    All&#8209;Knower&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:21]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The poet also referred to this when he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;A glance, then a smile, then a greeting, then words, then an \r\n    appointment, then a meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Although this is clear to everyone who understands how people \r\n    are and how the Shaytaan gets to them, it is more obvious in the case of \r\n    alcohol and those who drink it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the eastern proverb, &ldquo;In the beginning a man \r\n    takes a cup of wine&hellip; then the first cup takes a second, then the cup of wine \r\n    takes the man.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The story begins with advice from a doctor or friend to have \r\n    a cup of wine to increase the appetite, or to help one relax, or it starts \r\n    by joining friends in a social gathering where cups of alcohol are being \r\n    passed around, or as part of a meal offered, or whatever.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then gradually physical and psychological bonds are formed to \r\n    alcohol until it becomes part of a person&rsquo;s life, and the drunkard becomes a \r\n    slave to intoxication and to alcohol, and he seeks it as a sick person seeks \r\n    medicine, as the poet said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A cup that is drunk for pleasure, and a cup that is drunk as \r\n    a remedy for the first.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the first cup he may have found some benefit, without \r\n    getting drunk, and some relaxation and pleasure without losing his mind, and \r\n    the second likewise, but now he is longing for the cup of yesterday. When \r\n    the body gets used to this alcoholic poison, it needs to increase the dose \r\n    of alcohol time after time, in order to enjoy the relaxation and pleasure \r\n    that it found in the first cup. Then the drunkard starts to drink more \r\n    regularly, and his desire for alcohol grows stronger. The only guarantee \r\n    against addiction is not to drink alcohol at all. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we can see the wisdom of Islam in forbidding a little \r\n    or a lot of alcohol, because a little is the first step towards a lot, and a \r\n    little added to a little becomes a lot.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As the poet said: Do not think of a little as insignificant, \r\n    because even the mountains are formed of small pebbles.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to your asking: why does Islam require the \r\n    Muslims to keep away from alcohol and pork in order for their religious \r\n    commitment to be sound? Why does it not just explain how harmful they are \r\n    and let people choose for themselves?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the flawed questioning of one who is trying to cheat \r\n    himself. It is well known that people are not all the same in their levels \r\n    of understanding of what is beneficial and what is harmful, and their levels \r\n    of will power are not the same either, when it comes to choosing what is \r\n    beneficial and avoiding what is harmful. The behaviour of individuals and \r\n    societies cannot be controlled if things are left to each person&rsquo;s choice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If things are left to people&rsquo;s choice then the harm that \r\n    results from drinking alcohol is not limited only to the one who drinks, so \r\n    that he could be left to his own devices and choose whatever he wants for \r\n    himself. Rather the harmful results affect everyone. The diseases that \r\n    result from alcohol weaken society as a whole. The productivity of the \r\n    drunkard is decreased because of his drunkenness, which affects others. The \r\n    economy is affected as a result of the money spent on treating him, which \r\n    also affects others. Moreover there are crimes which result from this \r\n    addiction. In a World Health Organization report on violent crimes in 30 \r\n    countries, including the US and the UK, it says that 86% of murders and 50% \r\n    of rapes are carried out under the influence of alcohol. There are many \r\n    similar, well-known statistics on such topics in various countries around \r\n    the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to road accidents, the statistics are even more \r\n    well-known. In 1965 &ndash; for example &ndash; there were 49,000 deaths on roads in the \r\n    US, and 1,800,000 cases of permanent disability. Public health officials at \r\n    the time estimated that half of these deaths were caused by alcohol. The \r\n    losses resulting from these deaths in that year alone were valued at 8900 \r\n    million dollars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In Chile, in South America, 70% of traffic accidents in 1966 \r\n    were caused by drunkenness. In Paris between 10 and 15 % of all accidents \r\n    were found to have been caused by alcohol.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, we may respond to this question by asking:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why don&rsquo;t we explain how evil it is to steal and then leave \r\n    people to make their own choice, with no force or punishment? The same could \r\n    be said of killing and bribery&hellip; But then society would become a dangerous \r\n    and barbaric place, governed by the law of the jungle.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This question itself may be directed against all the laws and \r\n    systems which people follow in their lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The main reason why people deviate from the religion of \r\n    Allaah, which was revealed from heaven, and go against the laws that He has \r\n    prescribed for His slaves, is this idea &ndash; the idea that people can be left \r\n    with no commands to follow or prohibitions to heed, even though adhering to \r\n    commands and prohibitions is what is meant by submission to Allaah \r\n    (&lsquo;uboodiyyah) in its simplest form. This is the pure right of the Creator \r\n    because He is the Creator, and it is the primary duty of the created being, \r\n    because he is created. The Lord of the Worlds says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Does man think that he \r\n    will be left neglected (without being punished or rewarded for the \r\n    obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord Allaah on him)?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Qiyaamah 75:36].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    i.e., does man think that his Lord will leave him alone, with no obligations or commands or prohibitions, then He will ignore him in his grave with no resurrection, no gathering, no reckoning? What then would be the point of servitude to the Lord of the Worlds, if there were no commands or prohibitions, no reward or punishment?

But you have to realize that \r\n    this great religion comes from Allaah, the All-Wise and All-Knowing. Whatever is enjoined by Allaah and by His Messenger is Islam, and we can only \r\n    know Islam through the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the one who conveyed it from Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) has told us in more than one hadeeth that Allaah does not accept any righteous deeds until after the person has uttered the \r\n    Shahaadatayn. Indeed he told his companions not to tell anyone to do any of the rituals of Islam until they had pronounced the Shahaadatayn. In <i>\r\n    Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> (7372) and <i>Saheeh<\/i> <i>Muslim<\/i> (19) it was narrated that when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) sent Mu&rsquo;aadh to Yemen to call the People of the Book to Islam, he said to him: &ldquo;You are going to some people from among the People of \r\n    the Book.

If they accept that, then tell them \r\n    that Allaah has enjoined on them five prayers each day and night. If they accept that, then tell them that Allaah has enjoined upon them charity \r\n    [zakaah] to be taken from their rich and given to their poor&hellip;&rdquo; According to a report in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> he said: &ldquo;Let the first thing to \r\n    which you call them be&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence it should be clear to you &ndash; may Allaah \r\n    help you to do good &ndash; that uttering the Shahaadatayn is the first thing that the Muslim must do if he wants to become Muslim. It is not essential \r\n    for you to announce that to your family if you are not able to do that and you fear for yourself and your religion. Rather it is sufficient for \r\n    you to say these words to yourself, until the time comes when you can announce it to others, when you must do so. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to fasting, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told menstruating women to refrain from prayer and fasting during menses (the monthly period). When \r\n    the period ends, a woman has to make up the fasts of the days that she has missed. With regard to prayer, she does not have to make up the \r\n    prayers. The evidence for that is as follows.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A woman asked &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her), why it is that a woman who menstruates has to make up the fasts but not the prayers? She said: &ldquo;Are you a Haroori?&rdquo; She said, \r\n    &ldquo;No, I am just asking.&rdquo; &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: &ldquo;That (menstruation) used to happen to us at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we were commanded to make up the fasts but we were not commanded to make up the prayers.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 321; Muslim, 335.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This woman wondered why, when her period came \r\n    and she did not fast or pray, Allaah commanded women to make up the fasts but not the prayers. &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) replied \r\n    by telling her that this was the command of Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we must accept the \r\n    command of Allaah and His Messenger without raising objections based on our weak mental capacity which can only encompass a little of the wisdom \r\n    of Allaah the Most Wise, All-Knowing, which is what Allaah has taught us.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The ruling which we have mentioned is agreed \r\n    upon by all the Muslim scholars. Imam Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book <i>al-Tamheed<\/i> (16\/67): &ldquo;A woman who is \r\n    menstruating should not pray, and there is consensus on this point.&rdquo; And he also said&nbsp; (22\/107): &ldquo;&hellip; There is consensus that a menstruating woman \r\n    should not pray during the days of her period, and she should make up the missed fasts but not the prayers, and there is no difference of opinion \r\n    on any of that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the rest of the rituals of \r\n    Islam, you have to do whatever you can. Whatever you are unable to do because of fear for yourself or your religion, you are not obliged to do, as \r\n    the scholars have stated, because in that case you come under the ruling of one who has no choice, and Allaah made allowances for the one who is \r\n    forced to disbelieve (outwardly), so long as his heart remains open to faith and still hates kufr (disbelief). Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Whoever disbelieved in Allaah after his \r\n    belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from \r\n    Allaah, and theirs will be a great torment&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nahl 16:106]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <h1>See al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13\/196&nbsp;<\/h1>\r\n    <p>But you have to practise as much as you can \r\n    of the rituals of Islam, then try to reach a place where you will be able to practise as much as you can of the rituals of Islam. This action is \r\n    what the scholars of Islam call <i>hijrah<\/i> (migration for the sake of Allaah), and it is obligatory for every Muslim man and woman if they are \r\n    unable to establish the rituals of Islam in their own country and they are able to migrate.

That applies if he is unable to practise his religion, or he is forced to adhere to \r\n    the rulings of kufr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>From <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, 4\/264&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Even though migration \r\n    means leaving one&rsquo;s family and homeland, Allaah will fill the person&rsquo;s heart with happiness which will make him keen to migrate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thus it will become clear to you that so long \r\n    as you are unable to practise the rituals of Islam, then Allaah by His mercy will excuse you, and whatever you are able to do, then you are \r\n    obliged to do it, even if you do it in secret. If you have to put up with some difficulties that you are able to bear in order to do that, then \r\n    Allaah will reward greatly the one who patiently bears hardship for His sake and for the sake of His religion. The Book of Allaah is filled with \r\n    stories that speak of that. Even though uttering the Shahaadatayn is so important, Allaah has made that very easy. So we advise you to utter these \r\n    words even if you only say them to yourself, because the soundness of your Islam depends on that, as I am sure you understand, until Allaah makes \r\n    it easy for you to announce it publicly, by His leave.

What you are going to choose is nothing other than the religion of the Prophets of old. It is \r\n    the religion of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus.

Allaah made the message of Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) a message to all mankind until the Hour begins [i.e., until the Day of Judgement comes], whereas the Prophets \r\n    before him were each sent only to their own people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So do not hesitate.

Certainly, evil is their decision&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nahl 16:58]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The family in the broader sense, i.e., the tribe, was based \r\n    on supporting one another in all things, even in wrongdoing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>When Islam came, it did \r\n    away with all that and established justice, giving each person his or her \r\n    rights, even nursing infants, and even the miscarried foetus who was to be \r\n    respected and prayed for (i.e., given a proper funeral).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When you examine the family in the West today you will find \r\n    that families are disintegrating and the parents cannot control their \r\n    children, whether intellectually or morally. The son has the right to go \r\n    wherever he wants and do whatever he wants; the daughter has the right to \r\n    sit with whoever she wants and sleep with whoever she wants, all in the name \r\n    of freedom and rights. And what is the result? Broken families, children \r\n    born outside marriage, (elderly) mothers and fathers who are not looked \r\n    after. As some wise men have said, if you want to know the true nature of \r\n    these people, go to the prisons and the hospitals and seniors&rsquo; homes, for \r\n    children do not remember their parents except on holidays and special \r\n    occasions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that many non-Muslims the institution of family \r\n    is destroyed. When Islam came it paid a great deal of attention to the \r\n    establishment of&nbsp; strong families and protecting them from things that could \r\n    harm them, and preserving family ties whilst giving each member of the \r\n    family an important role in life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam honoured women, whether as mothers, daughters or \r\n    sisters. It honoured women as mothers. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, who among people is most deserving of my good company?&rdquo; He said, \r\n    &ldquo;Your mother.&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Then who?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Your mother.&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Then \r\n    who?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Your mother.&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Then who?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Then your \r\n    father.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5626; Muslim, 2548)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam honours women as daughters. It was narrated from Abu \r\n    Sa&rsquo;eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever has three daughters or three sisters, or \r\n    two daughters or two sisters, and takes good care of them and fears Allaah \r\n    with regard to them, will enter Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, 2\/190)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Islam honours women as wives. It was narrated that \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said: the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best of you are those who are best to their wives, \r\n    and I am the best of you to my wives.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 3895).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam gave women their rights of inheritance and other \r\n    rights. It gave women rights like those of men in many spheres. The Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Women are the twin \r\n    halves of men.&rdquo; (Narrated by Abu Dawood in his <i>Sunan<\/i>, 236, from the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi \r\n    Dawood<\/i>, 216).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam encourages men to treat their wives well, and gives \r\n    women the freedom to choose their husbands; it gives women much of the \r\n    responsibility for raising the children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam gives fathers and mothers a great deal of \r\n    responsibility for raising their children. It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Umar heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) say, &ldquo;Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his \r\n    flock. The leader is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The man is \r\n    the shepherd of his family and he is responsible for his flock. The woman is \r\n    the shepherd of her husband&rsquo;s household and is responsible for her flock. \r\n    The servant is a shepherd of his master&rsquo;s wealth and is responsible for his \r\n    flock.&rdquo; He said, I heard this from the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 853; Muslim, 1829)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam paid a great deal of attention to implanting the principle \r\n    of respect for fathers and mothers, taking care of them and obeying their \r\n    commands until death. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. \r\n    And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them \r\n    attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout \r\n    at them but address them in terms of honour&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Isra&rsquo; 17:23]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Islam protects the honour, \r\n    chastity, purity and lineage of the family, so it encourages marriage and \r\n    forbids free mixing of men and women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam gives each family member an important role to play. So fathers and mothers take care of the children and give them an Islamic upbringing; children are to listen and obey, and respect the rights of fathers and mothers, on a basis of love and respect.

Praise be to Allaah for what we have read in your question. We \r\n    understand the difficulties that you are facing and how you feel. We will \r\n    try to offer you some solutions to the problems you are facing. We are \r\n    impressed by your learning all the words of the prayer and of al-Faatihah \r\n    even though your language is English, and by your knowing Allaah since the \r\n    age of eleven and your becoming more convinced and certain of Islam after \r\n    three years, now that you are fourteen. We tell you the following, and \r\n    Allaah is the Source of strength:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When a person believes in something, he will be prepared to \r\n    make sacrifices for its sake, so how about if this thing is Tawheed or \r\n    belief in Allaah Alone, worshipping Him alone, following His Messenger and \r\n    obeying His commands? Undoubtedly in this case the sacrifices will be even \r\n    greater. The Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \r\n    us that Paradise is surrounded with obstacles, and what that means is that \r\n    there is no way for us to reach Paradise except by overcoming obstacles and \r\n    putting up with difficulties. For the reward of Allaah is precious and its \r\n    blessings are immense and never-ending, and life there is eternal and its \r\n    joys and pleasures will never cease. So the true Muslim will be prepared to \r\n    sacrifice many things in this transient, passing world for the sake of that \r\n    blessing; he will be prepared to put up with the insults and slander of \r\n    people, with their criticism and mockery, for the sake of attaining that \r\n    blessing. There is something else good about this matter, which is that the \r\n    more a person is harassed and bears it with patience, the more his reward \r\n    will increase and the higher he will rise in status before the Lord of the \r\n    Worlds; indeed, his faith may increase and grow stronger, so that he will \r\n    enjoy bearing this bitterness with patience for the sake of earning Allaah&rsquo;s \r\n    pleasure. The sweetness of striving to please the Lord cancels out the \r\n    bitterness of people&rsquo;s anger, insults and criticism. If the harm he faces is \r\n    just some words of mockery or criticism that he heard, what is wrong with \r\n    his putting up with that in order to earn the pleasure of the Lord and His \r\n    reward? In all of that he believes in the promise of Allaah, as He said in \r\n    his holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So be patient.

Since you are female, you are not obliged to go to the \r\n    mosque as men are, so you will not be falling short if you do not go to the \r\n    mosque, because the best place for a woman to pray is in her own house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Try as much as you can to wear hijaab, and put up with \r\n    insults for the sake of Allaah. Be patient in praying the five daily prayers \r\n    on time, knowing that they do not all coincide with the time you must be in \r\n    school. If you pray Fajr after dawn comes, then you go to school, you will \r\n    be able to pray Zuhr at school before the time for &lsquo;Asr comes.&nbsp; You could \r\n    find the time for that in a break between classes or at lunchtime, or after \r\n    coming home. It is important to pray Zuhr after the sun has passed its \r\n    zenith and before the time for &lsquo;Asr comes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; If you treat people kindly, you will win them over in the \r\n    end and you will not be rejected, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Do not delay entering Islam, do not wait a moment longer. \r\n    For you do not know when death will come. So utter the words of the \r\n    Shahaadatayn (the twin declaration of faith) and start praying. You will get \r\n    used to the number of rak&rsquo;ahs and the times of prayer, the words to say and \r\n    how to do it as time goes by, and this will dispel the confusion that you \r\n    mention in your question. So long as you are prepared to enter Islam, you do \r\n    not &ndash; praise be to Allaah &ndash; need the approval of your mother or grandmother, \r\n    or anyone else, because Allaah has commanded you to follow His religion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will \r\n    never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:85]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; Look for Muslim \r\n    sisters with whom you can make friends and be in touch, so that they can \r\n    help you to learn the religion and remain steadfast in following it.

For more details on how to do that, see Question no. 13340 and 11497. \r\n    You also have to believe with certainty that &lsquo;Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son \r\n    of Mary &ndash; peace be upon him) is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, not a \r\n    god or the son of God; rather he is a human being whom Allaah sent with the \r\n    Message of Divine Oneness (Tawheed) and that only Allaah is to be \r\n    worshipped, with no partner or associate.

It has five characteristics: on this day Allaah created Adam; on this \r\nday Adam came down to earth; on this day Allaah caused Adam to die; on this day \r\nthere is an hour during which no one asks Allaah for something but He will grant \r\nit to him, so long as he does not ask for something haraam (forbidden); and on \r\nthis day the Hour [i.e., the Day of Judgement] will begin, so there is no angel \r\nwho is close to Allaah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain and no tree \r\nthat does not feel some apprehension on Friday.&#8221; (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1084. \r\nAl-Busayri said: its isnaad is hasan, and it was classed as saheeh in <i>Saheeh \r\nAbi Dawood<\/i>, 888).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>12 \r\n&#8211; It is mustahabb (recommended) to wear the best clothes one has on Friday. \r\nImaam Ahmad narrated in his <i>Musnad<\/i> that Abu Ayyoob said: &#8220;I heard the \r\nMessenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, \r\n&#8216;Whoever takes a bath on Friday, puts on perfume if he has some, wears his best \r\nclothes then goes out , walking in a dignified manner until he reaches the \r\nmosque, then he prostrates in prayer if he wants and does not disturb anybody, \r\nthen he remains quiet until the imaam comes out and he prays, that will be an \r\nexpiation from one Friday to the next.&#8217;&#8221; (Narrated by Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad<\/i>, \r\n23059; classed as hasan by al-Ana&#8217;oot).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>In\r\n<i>Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i> it is narrated from &#8216;Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam that he heard \r\nthe Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say on \r\nthe minbar (pulpit) one Friday: &#8220;There is nothing wrong with any one of you if \r\nhe buys two garments for Friday other than his work day clothes.&#8221; (Narrated by \r\nAbu Dawood, 1078; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, \r\n953).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>13 \r\n&#8211; It is mustahabb on Fridays to perfume the mosque with incense.

This is why Na&#8217;eem was called al-Mujmir \r\n(from the word tajmeer meaning perfuming with incense).&nbsp; <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>14 \r\n&#8211; It is a day on which sins are expiated. In <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> it is \r\nnarrated that Salmaan al-Faarisi said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and \r\nblessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#8216;No man takes a bath on Friday and \r\npurifies himself as much as he can, and makes his hair tidy, and puts on \r\nperfume, then goes out, and does not come between two people, then prays as \r\nAllaah decrees for him and listens attentively when the imaam speaks, but he \r\nwill be forgiven for his bad deeds between this Friday and the other.&#8217;&#8221; (al-Bukhaari, \r\n843).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>15 \r\n&#8211; On Friday there is the &#8220;hour of response&#8221; which is an hour in which no Muslim \r\nasks Allaah for something but He will grant it. In <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> it is \r\nnarrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;The Messenger \r\nof Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#8216;On Friday \r\nthere is an hour in which no Muslim asks for something whilst he is standing in \r\nprayer, but it will be given to him&#8221; &#8211; and he demonstrated the shortness of that \r\ntime with his hands. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 883; Muslim, 1406).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>16 \r\n&#8211; On Fridays there is the khutbah (sermon) which is intended to praise and \r\nglorify Allaah, and to bear witness to His Oneness and to the Messengership of \r\nHis Messenger, and to remind His slaves of His blessings, to warn them of His \r\npunishment and wrath, to advise them of that which will bring them closer to Him \r\nand His Paradise, and to forbid them that which will bring them closer to His \r\nanger and Hell. This is the purpose behind the khutbah and of gathering to hear \r\nit.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>17 \r\n&#8211; It is the day on which it is mustahabb to devote oneself to worship and it has \r\nan advantage over other days by being characterized with all kinds of worship, \r\nobligatory and mustahabb. Allaah has made for the followers of each religion a \r\nday on which they devote themselves to worship and refrain from worldly work. So \r\nFriday is a day of worship, and in relation to other days it is like Ramadaan in \r\nrelation to other months; the &#8220;hour of response&#8221; on Friday is like Laylat al-Qadr \r\n(the Night of Decree) in Ramadaan. Hence whoever gets it right on Friday, his \r\nwhole week will be good, and whoever gets it right in Ramadan, his whole year \r\nwill be good, and whoever gets it right on Hajj, his whole life will be good. \r\nFriday is the measure of the week, Ramadaan is the measure of the year and Hajj \r\nis the measure of one's life. And Allaah is the Source of strength.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>19 \r\n&#8211; It is the day with which Allaah has exclusively favoured this ummah, and from \r\nwhich He led the People of the Book astray before them, as it says in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i>, \r\nwhere it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and \r\nblessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#8220;The sun has never risen or set on any \r\nday better than Friday. Allaah guided us to it and led the people away from it. \r\nThe people are behind us in this respect. It (Friday) is for us, Saturday is for \r\nthe Jews and Sunday is for the Christians.&#8221; (Narrated by Ahmad, 10305, classed \r\nas saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 3\/114).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>20 &#8211; It is the day which \r\nAllaah chose from among all the days of the week, just as He chose Ramadaan from \r\namong the months of the year and Laylat al-Qadr from among all the nights, and \r\nMakkah from among all places on earth, and Muhammad from all of mankind.<\/p>\r\n<p><span>\r\nWith regard to the second question, the Muslims have several special occasions, \r\nsuch as:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>1 &#8211; \r\nThe blessed month of Ramadaan, which is a month that has special \r\ncharacteristics.

This is the work of the \r\nProphets and Messengers. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\nhim) explained that his mission in life, and the mission of his followers, is to \r\ncall people to Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>\r\n&ldquo;Say (O Muhammad): &lsquo;This is my way; I invite unto Allaah (i.e. to the Oneness of \r\nAllaah &mdash; Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me \r\n(also must invite others to Allaah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allaah &mdash; Islamic \r\nMonotheism with sure knowledge).

And it is they who are the successful&rdquo;[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:104] <br>\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Convey from me \r\neven if it is (only) one aayah.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3461) <br>\r\nCalling people to Allaah is an important task and a glorious mission, because it \r\nmeans calling people to worship Allaah alone. It means bringing them forth from \r\ndarkness to the light, planting goodness in the place of evil and truth in the \r\nplace of falsehood. Hence whoever does this needs to have knowledge, \r\nunderstanding, patience, forbearance, gentleness and kindness. He needs to give \r\nof his wealth and of himself, and he needs to understand people&rsquo;s circumstances \r\nand habits. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>\r\n&ldquo;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom \r\n(i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur&rsquo;aan) and fair preaching, and argue \r\nwith them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone \r\nastray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided&rdquo; <br>\r\n[al-Nahl 16:125] <br>\r\nAllaah blessed His Messenger with the words (interpretation of the meaning): <br>\r\n&ldquo;And by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe \r\nand harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over \r\n(their faults), and ask (Allaah&rsquo;s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the \r\naffairs&rdquo; <br>\r\n[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:159] <br>\r\nThe daa&rsquo;iyah (caller) may be faced with debates in his da&rsquo;wah activities, \r\nespecially with the People of the Book. Allaah has commanded us, if it reaches \r\nthe point of debate, to debate in a manner that is better, which is with \r\nkindness and gentleness, explaining the principles of Islam as they came, pure \r\nand simple, in a kindly manner and with no element of compulsion. Allaah says \r\n(interpretation of the meaning): <br>\r\n&ldquo;And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it \r\nbe in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them \r\nto Islamic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong; \r\nand say (to them): &lsquo;We believe in that which has been revealed to us and \r\nrevealed to you; our Ilaah (God) and your Ilaah (God) is One (i.e. Allaah), and \r\nto Him we have submitted (as Muslims)&rsquo;&rdquo; <br>\r\n[al-&lsquo;Ankaboot 29:46] <br>\r\nCalling people to Allaah is a virtuous deed which brings great reward. The \r\nProphet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever calls others \r\nto guidance will have a reward like the rewards of those who follow him, without \r\nthat detracting from their reward in any way. And whoever calls others to \r\nmisguidance will have a burden of sin like the burden of those who follow him, \r\nwithout that detracting from their burden in any way.&rdquo;(Narrated by Muslim, 2674)\r\n<br>\r\nIf building a physical structure needs effort and patience until it is complete, \r\nthen building souls and guiding them to the truth also needs patience and \r\nsacrifice. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called \r\npeople to Islam, patiently bearing the persecution of the kuffaar, Jews and \r\nhypocrites. They made fun of him and disbelieved in him; they insulted him and \r\nthrew stones at him; they said that he was a sorcerer or a madman; they accused \r\nhim of being a poet or a soothsayer &ndash; but he (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\nupon him) bore all that with patience until Allaah granted him victory and \r\ncaused His religion to prevail. So the daa&rsquo;iyah must follow his example: <br>\r\n&ldquo;So be patient (O Muhammad).

(in other words, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted\r\n    that from them because he knew, from what Allaah taught him of the Unseen, that these\r\n    people would become good Muslims and would give charity and engage in jihaad, whereas we\r\n    cannot know the Unseen and how this non-Muslim will be in the future). If we accepted the\r\n    conditions laid down by the kuffaar, Islam would disintegrate.

The Messenger <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of All&acirc;h be upon him) told &#145;Ali, when he sent him to the people of\r\n    Khaybar: &#147;Tell them what their duties are towards Allaah in Islam.&#148; The\r\n    condition of Islam is that it must be accepted in totality, as it is. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\n    and blessings of All&acirc;h be upon him) told Mu&#146;aadh, &#147;Teach them that Allaah has\r\n    enjoined five prayers upon them, and if they accept that, then tell them about\r\n    Zakaah.&#148; So the obligations of Islam have to be accepted.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Question:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Can we not say that this person&#146;s entering Islam serves a great\r\n    interest, and that their stipulating that they should be excused a few acts of worship is\r\n    less harmful?<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh: Not at all!

For example there are several \r\npages on the Internet that you can use to gain knowledge and benefit. You can also \r\ncorrespond to the various Islamic organizations and publishing houses to get valuable \r\nand informative books about Islam.

I also commend and appreciate \r\n  your wise and mature sense of judgment in supporting your friend's decision \r\n  to accept Islam. It shows admirable wisdom and a balanced sense of sagacity \r\n  and understanding of this blessed event.<\/p>\r\n<p>Regarding the issue of dating in Islam, \r\n  one must first define what is meant by &quot;dating.&quot; If it is understood \r\n  to mean how a man and a woman get to know each other for the purpose of marriage, \r\n  then there are certain guidelines and established procedures which can be discussed. \r\n  However, if it is understood to refer to casual relationships between men and \r\n  women who for the purpose of &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;going out&quot; and the \r\n  such, then there is no provision for this in Islam. Such a situation is not \r\n  considered respectful for neither the man nor the woman, nor is it constructive \r\n  for the concept or the building of the family or society or social responsibility. \r\n  Opening the door to relationships of love and infatuation and passion and pre-marital \r\n  sex is categorically prohibited in Islam. It does not lead to the establishment \r\n  of a family nor to proper and virtuous upbringing of children nor to stability \r\n  and mutual care and tranquility and peace of mind between a man and woman. Rather, \r\n  it leads to disorder, the disgracing of one's honor and dignity, and to a lifestyle \r\n  similar to that of animals, and to that of illegitimate children who are subjected \r\n  to life of vagrancy and loss. (Please see question \r\n  # 61 \r\n  which addresses the issue of prohibition of pre-marital relationships).<\/p>\r\n<p>As for the former case, regarding how a \r\n  man and a woman come to know each other for the purpose of marriage, it varies \r\n  from circumstance to circumstance. Normally if a man has the desire to marry \r\n  and has the ability to accept the responsibility, and he does not have anyone \r\n  in mind, he will ask his friends, family, and relatives if there is a lady that \r\n  may be suitable for him and his expectations among their acquaintances and relatives. \r\n  If someone is suggested, he normally asks about her extensively, about her religious \r\n  observance, her personality, her knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, suitability \r\n  as a wife willing to accept all the relevant responsibities, etc. If preliminary \r\n  information seems appealing, then normally she is told that there is someone \r\n  interested in meeting her and she is likewise given relevant information about \r\n  him.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this point, assuming the man and the \r\n  woman as well as both families involved agree that there is potential, then \r\n  the man usually visits the woman's family, often accompanied by members of his \r\n  own. They are given the opportunity to see each other and sit and talk together, \r\n  to converse modestly (but not in complete solitude) regarding whatever is relevant \r\n  to making an informed judgment. The intention for this meeting should be for \r\n  them to be able to make a decision whether or not they feel are mutually suitable. \r\n  Afterwards, they each evaluate their own and their families' reactions, and \r\n  pray to Allah that He guides them to what is in their best interest, and to \r\n  make them accept the outcome. When both sides feel comfortable and feel they \r\n  know everything they need to, based on all that has been mentioned such as asking \r\n  about the other person, knowing their family, meeting in person, etc., they \r\n  can make a final decision whether to carry on with marriage or not.<\/p>\r\n<p>As for your second question regarding the \r\n  procedure for embracing the religion of Islam, it is actually an extremely simple \r\n  process, without complication or prolongment. This is because it is something \r\n  between a person and his Lord and there are no other parties involved. All that \r\n  is required of a person in order to embrace Islam is that he or she pronounce \r\n  the two testaments of belief in the Islamic creed, believing in their meaning, \r\n  then to take a complete bath with the intention of (ritual) purification in \r\n  order to start performing prayers (note to ensure complete cleanliness one should \r\n  shave pubic and under-arm hair, and a man should be circumcized if he is not \r\n  already--Islam places great emphasis on proper hygiene and personal cleanliness).<\/p>\r\n<p>As for the two testimonies of creed, the \r\n  first is &quot;<em>ash-hadu an laa ilaaha illa allah<\/em>&quot; (I testify that \r\n  there is no deity other then Allah), which means that one believes and confirms \r\n  that there is nothing to be worshipped other than Allah and that one is prepared \r\n  to implement His divine rulings and guidlines (shari'a) for all aspects of life. \r\n  The second is &quot;<em>ash-hadu anna muhammad ar-rasool ullah<\/em>&quot; which \r\n  means the belief that Muhammad <img> (peace be upon him) \r\n  is the seal of the prophets (i.e. the final one), whom Allah has sent with the \r\n  Islamic religion to supercede all other previous religions and that it is obligatory \r\n  to comply with what he has enjoined, and to abstain and renounce all that he \r\n  has prohibited and restrained.<\/p>\r\n<p>I tend to gather from your question that \r\n  there is a degree of pondering on your part or inclination towards embracing \r\n  the Islamic religion, joining the example of your friend. I would invite you \r\n  to carry through with it without excessive delay and reluctance, for one does \r\n  not know when one's fate will come. So why not meet one's unavoidable fate as \r\n  a believer in Allah (God) and the Hereafter, a member of the religion of Islam? \r\n  It is the religion which Allah has specified that He will not accept any other \r\n  religion besides it, and He will not save anyone from Hell besides its followers. \r\n  And no doubt that this step will be the greatest thing ever that you will have \r\n  experienced during your 33 years of life. Surely you will not regret it at all \r\n  and Allah will help you to surmount the difficulties you perhaps may face in \r\n  your path after accepting Islam, such as the scorn of some relatives or family \r\n  members or the alientation of some friends. However, the step in fulfilling \r\n  your destiny is much more important and significant that all this.<\/p>\r\n<p>We pray for you to be bestowed with grace, \r\n  and may Allah guide you to success in what is the most true and right.<\/p>\r\n<p>Waiting for glad tidings in the near future, \r\n  may Allah guard and protect you.<\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"11124","question_id":"11124","answers":"<p>He should say <i>al-shahaadatain<\/i> first, then he \r\n  should purify himself for <i>Salat<\/i> and he can perform <i>ghusl<\/i> (complete \r\n  bath) because the prophet <img> (peace and blessings \r\n  of Allah be upon him) ordered some of his companions to perform it when they \r\n  accepted Islam. <\/p>\r\n<p>See question #179 for an explanation of the two \r\n  testimonies of Islamic faith.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"11125","question_id":"11125","answers":"<p>If a person is ordered to perform a certain assignment at his work, he should consider it&#151;if the act \r\ndoes not involve any disobedience to Allah (subhaanahu WA ta'aala) he should execute it.

Before answering this question, it is important to \r\nwarn the Muslim brothers residing in countries of the <i>kuffar<\/i> (unbelievers) of the danger \r\nin marrying unbelieving women from these countries which enforce their man-made \r\nsystem of laws. And much of what is ruled upon regarding possession of children is in \r\nthe favor of the unbelieving mother, due to the consideration that she is a citizen of this \r\ncountry or perhaps any other factor, such as her role as a mother, regardless of her \r\nreligion.

Let us gather together&#151;our sons and your sons, and our women and \r\nyour women, and ourselves and yourselves&#151;then let us earnestly pray and invoke the \r\ncurse of Allah on those who are the liars.&#146; &#148; (3:61)<\/p>\r\n<p>And <i>mubaahala<\/i> is a type of <i>ibtihaal<\/i> (supplication) and it is: the endeavor in making \r\n<i>duaa&#146;<\/i> for cursing etc, actively performed by two or more parties so that it falls upon \r\none of the two parties. And its definition according to <i>shari&#146;a<\/i> is the gathering of people \r\nwhen they differ on an issue and the calling for Allah&#146;s curse on the transgressor among \r\nthem. And the Muslim father&#146;s calling of this woman to <i>mubaahala<\/i> for Allah&#146;s curse \r\nand revenge to descend upon whoever is guilty of falsehood of the two parties would \r\nbe something prescribed and he can do it so that perhaps it may affect the woman.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is essential and important advice in this aforementioned case that the father maintains a \r\nconsistent link between himself and his two sons via visits and fosters friendly relations \r\nthrough various gifts and toys so that the children remain on good ties with their father. \r\nThis will be helpful for him to win them over to the Islamic religion.<\/p>\r\n<p>We ask Allah for protection and to guide our brother&#146;s children to Islam and to inspire \r\nhis integrity in action and to guide us all to what is correct.<\/p>\r\n<p><i>Wallahu a&#146;lam<\/i> (and Allah knows best).<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"11130","question_id":"11130","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We do not wish to respond to slander in kind, but we will answer you,\r\n    you disbeliever, with quotes from the Word of God (the Qur&rsquo;aan), if you even believe\r\n    in the existence of God.<\/p>\r\n    <p>O disbeliever, we debate with you in the words addressed by Allaah (the\r\n    Arabic name of the One True God) to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and the\r\n    disbelievers.

On this site you will find a lot of information and answers to questions from\r\n    people whose circumstances are similar to yours.

The boy became\r\n    sick, and the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to visit him\r\n    when he was on his death-bed. He called him to Islam, and the boy looked at his father,\r\n    who was standing by his head. His father said, &#147;Listen to Abu&#146;l-Qaasim.&#148;\r\n    [Abu&#146;l-Qaasim (Father of al-Qaasim) was the kunya or &#147;nickname&#148; of the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &#150; it is an Arab custom to\r\n    address people as &#147;Father of&#148; and &#147;Mother of&#148; their oldest son &#150;\r\n    Translator].

When the magician grew old, he said to the king, &#145;I\r\n    have grown old, so send me a boy to whom I can teach magic.&#146; So the king sent him a\r\n    boy, and he taught him magic. On his way, the boy passed by a monk, so he sat with him and\r\n    listened to him, and he liked what he said. When he came to the magician, he passed by the\r\n    monk and sat with him, then when he came to the magician, he hit him because he was late.\r\n    The boy complained about that to the monk, who said, &#145;If you are afraid of the\r\n    magician, tell him, &#145;I was late because of my family&#146; and if you are afraid of\r\n    your family, tell them, &#145;I was late because of the magician.&#146; Whilst this was\r\n    going &#25; on, he came across a huge beast that was blocking the people&#146;s way. He\r\n    said, &#145;Today I will know whether the monk is better or the magician.&#146; He picked\r\n    up a stone and said, &#145;O All&acirc;h, if the monk&#146;s way is dearer to you than the\r\n    magician&#146;s way, then kill this beast so that the people may go on their way.&#146;\r\n    Then he threw the stone and killed the beast, and the people went on their way. He came to\r\n    the monk and told him what had happened. The monk said to him, &#145;O my son, today you\r\n    are better than I, you have reached such a level and now you will be tested. If you are\r\n    put to the test, do not tell anyone about me.&#146; The young man began to heal the blind\r\n    and the lepers, and to cure people from all kinds of sickness. One of the king&#146;s\r\n    courtiers who had become blind heard about him, so he brought him many gifts and said,\r\n    &#145;Whatever I have piled up here is for you, if you heal me.&#146; The boy said,\r\n    &#145;I do not heal anyone, it is Allaah who heals. If you believe in Allaah and call on\r\n    Allaah, He will heal you.&#146; So he believed in Allaah and and Allaah healed him. Then\r\n    he came to the king and sat with him as he had always done. The king said to him,\r\n    &#145;Who gave you back your sight?&#146; He said, &#145;My Lord.&#146; The king said,\r\n    &#145;Do you have any lord other than me?&#146; He said, &#145;My Lord and your Lord is\r\n    Allaah.&#146; So the king took him and kept touring him until he told him about the boy.\r\n    So the boy was brought to the king, who said, &#145;O my son, I have heard about your\r\n    magic, that you heal the blind and the leper, and you do such and such.&#146; The boy\r\n    said, &#145;I do not heal anyone, it is Allaah Who heals.&#146; The took him and tortured\r\n    him until he told him about the monk. The monk was brought and was told, &#145;Give up\r\n    your religion,&#146; and he refused. So a saw was brought and placed on the top of his\r\n    head, and he was cut in two. Then the king&#146;s courtier was brought and was told,\r\n    &#145;Give up your religion,&#146; and he refused. So a saw was brought and placed on the\r\n    top of his head, and he was cut in two. Then the boy was brought and was told, &#145;Give\r\n    up your religion,&#146; and he refused. The king gave him to a group of his companions and\r\n    said, &#145;Take him to such and such a mountain, and take him up the mountain. When you\r\n    reach the top of the mountain, if he gives up his religion (then leave him alone),\r\n    otherwise throw him down. So they took him up the mountain, and the boy said, &#145;O\r\n    Allaah, protect me from them in whatever manner You wish.&#146; So the mountain was shaken\r\n    and they fell down, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king asked, &#145;What\r\n    happened to your companions?&#146; He said, &#145;Allaah protected me from them.&#146;\r\n    Then the king gave him to another group of his companions, and said, &#145;Take him and\r\n    put him on a ship, then take him to the middle of the sea. If he gives up his religion\r\n    (then leave him alone), otherwise throw him overboard. So they took him and he said,\r\n    &#145;O Allaah, protect me from them in whatever manner You wish.&#146; The boat was\r\n    turned upside down and they drowned, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king\r\n    asked, &#145;What happened to your companions?&#146; He said, &#145;Allaah protected me\r\n    from them.&#146; The boy said to the king: &#145;You will not be able to kill me unless\r\n    you do what I tell you.&#146; The king said, &#145;What is that then?&#146; He said,\r\n    &#145;Gather the people together in one place and crucify me on a tree-trunk, then take an\r\n    arrow from my quiver and put it in your bow. Then say, &#147;In the name of Allaah, the\r\n    Lord of the boy&#148; and shoot me. If you do that, you will kill me.&#146; So the king\r\n    gathered the people in one place, crucified the boy on a tree-trunk, took an arrow from\r\n    his quiver and placed it in his bow. Then he said, &#145;In the name of Allaah, the Lord\r\n    of the boy&#146; and shot him. The arrow hit his temple (the side of his head), and he put\r\n    his hand on the side of his head where he had been hit, and died. The people said,\r\n    &#145;We believe in the Lord of the boy, we believe in the Lord of the boy, we believe in\r\n    the Lord of the boy.&#146; Someone came to the king and said, &#145;Do you see what you\r\n    were afraid of?

May peace and blessings of Allah be upon Mohammad, His last messenger.&nbsp; \r\n  <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>The purpose of this hand-out \r\n  is to correct a false idea spread among those willing to adopt Islam as their \r\n  faith. Some people have a wrong notion that entering into th Islamic fold requires \r\n  an announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking scholars \r\n  or shaikhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other authorities. \r\n  It is also thought that the act accepting Islam, should, as a condition, have \r\n  a certificate issued by the authorities, as evidence to that effect.<\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> We wish to clarify that whole \r\n  matter is very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required. \r\n  For Allah, Almighty, is above all comprehension and knows well the secrets of \r\n  all hearts. Nevertheless, those who are going to adopt Islam as their religion \r\n  are advised to register themselves as Muslims with the concerned governmental \r\n  agency, as this procedure may facilitate for them many matters including the \r\n  possibility of performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) and Umrah. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> If anyone has a real desire to be a muslim and has full conviction \r\n  and strong belief that Islam is the true religion ordained by Allah for all \r\n  human-being, then, one should pronounce the &ldquo;shahada&rdquo;, the testimony \r\n  of faith, without further delay. The Holy Qur&rsquo;an is explicit on this regard \r\n  as Allah states : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big><i><span>&ldquo;The \r\n  Religion in the sight of Allah is Islam&rdquo;<\/span><\/i> (Qur&rsquo;an 3:19) \r\n  <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>in another verse of the Holy Qur&rsquo;an, Allah states : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> \r\n  <i><span>&ldquo;If anyone desires a religion other \r\n  than Islam (Submission to Allah), Never will it be accepted of him; and in the \r\n  Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (their selves in the \r\n  hell fire).&rdquo;<\/span><\/i> (Qur&rsquo;an 3:85) <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> In addition, Islam is the only religion prevailing over all other \r\n  religions. Allah states in the Holy Qur&rsquo;an : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big><i><span>&ldquo;To thee We sent the Scripture \r\n  in the truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it \r\n  in safety :&hellip;.<\/span><\/i> (Qur&rsquo;an 5:48) <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> Mohammad, the Prophet of Allah (Peace and blessing of Allah be upon \r\n  him), said : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>&ldquo;The superstructure of Islam is raised on five (pillars) : testifying \r\n  that there is no God (none truly to be worshipped) but Allah, and that Mohammad \r\n  is the messenger of Allah, performing the prayer, paying the Zakah (poor-due), \r\n  fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj.&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>The Shahada can be declared as follows : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>&nbsp;&ldquo;ASH-HADU ANLA ELAHA ILLA-ALLAH WA ASH-HADU ANNA MOHAMMADAN \r\n  RASUL-ALLAH&rdquo;. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>&nbsp;The English translation is : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>&ldquo;I bear witness that there is no deity (none truly to be worshipped) \r\n  but, Allah, and I bear witness that Mohammad is the messenger of Allah.&rdquo; \r\n  <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>However, it would not be sufficient for anyone to only utter this \r\n  testimony oraly either in private or in public; but rather, he should believe \r\n  in it by heart with a firm conviction and unshakeable faith. If one is truly \r\n  sincere and complies with the teachings of Islam in all his life, he will find \r\n  himself a new born person.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>This will move him to strive more and more to improve his character \r\n  and draw nearer to perfection. The light of the living faith will fill his heart \r\n  until he becomes the embodiment of that faith. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> What would be next after declaring oneself a Muslim ? one should \r\n  then know the real concept underlying this testimony which means the oneness \r\n  of Allah and meet its requiremants. One must behave accordingly, applying this \r\n  true faith to every thing one speaks or does. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> What do the words of the &ldquo;Shahada&rdquo; signify? The significant \r\n  point which every Muslim must know very well is the truth that there is no God \r\n  (deity) to be worshipped other than Allah. He-glory be to Him &ndash; is the \r\n  only true God, Who alone deserves to be worshipped, since He is the Giver of \r\n  life and Sustainer and Nourisher of mankind and all creation with His unlimited \r\n  bounties. Man must worship Allah, Who alone is worthy of worship. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> The second part of the Shahada &ldquo;i.e., Wa Ash-hadu anna Mohammadan \r\n  abduhu wa rasuluh&rdquo; means that Prophet Mohammad (Peace and blessing of \r\n  Allah be upon him) is the servant and chosen messenger of Allah. No one must \r\n  have two opinions about this matter. In fact the Muslim has to obey the commands \r\n  of the Prophet (Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), to believe him in \r\n  what he has said, to practise his teachings, to avoid what ha has forbidden, \r\n  and to worship Allah alone according to the message revealed to him, for all \r\n  the teachings of the Prophet were in fact revelation and inspirations conveyed \r\n  to him by Allah. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> What is the meaning of worship? It simply means rendering sincere \r\n  service, showing reverence for Allah. In a deeper shade of meaning, it implies \r\n  total submission and complete obedience to Allah&rsquo;s commandments both in \r\n  utterances and actions of man whether explicit or implicit. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> Worship fall into two categories : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li><big>Visible (manifest or outward). <\/big><\/li>\r\n  <li><big>Invisible (concealed or inward). <\/big><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><big>Visible worship includes acts such as uttering \r\n  the two parts of the &ldquo;Shahada&rdquo;, performing prayers, giving Zakah \r\n  (the poor-due), recitation of the Holy Qur&rsquo;an, supplication, adoring Allah \r\n  by praising Him, purifying our bodies before prayers, etc. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>This type of worship is associated with \r\n  movement of the parts of the human body.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>Invisible worship is to believe in Allah, \r\n  in the Day of Judgement (in the Hereafter), in the Angels, in the Books of Allah, \r\n  in the Prophets of Allah, in the Divine Decree of destiny (that good and bad \r\n  are determined by Allah alone). <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> This type worship does not involve movement of parts of the body \r\n  but it surely has bearing on one&rsquo;s heart which subsequently affects one&rsquo;s&nbsp; \r\n  way of life.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> It should be borne in mind that any worship not dedicated to Allah \r\n  alone will be rejected as one form of polytheism and this causes apostasy from \r\n  the Islamic fold. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> The next step for a newly revert to Islam is the purify himself by \r\n  taking a cmplete bath. He should then resolve to comply with the principles \r\n  and rules of Islam in their entirety. He should disown all forms of polytheism \r\n  and false beliefs. He should reject evil and be rigtheous. Such rejection of \r\n  evil and being righteous is one of the requisites of the motto of Islam &ndash; \r\n  that is, Laa ilaha illallah.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> Allah states in the Holy qur&rsquo;an : <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big><i><span>&ldquo;&hellip;whoever rejects \r\n  evil and believes in the Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy Hand-hold, \r\n  that never breaks&hellip;&rdquo;<\/span><\/i> (Qur&rsquo;an 2:256). <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> \r\n  We have to consider that when declare from our heart that &ldquo; there is no \r\n  god (deity) worthy to be worshipped but Allah&rdquo;, it implies on our part \r\n  love, devotion,&nbsp; faith and obedience to the rules of Islamic legislations \r\n  which are legally binding on all Muslims. It is a requiremant of&nbsp; &ldquo;there \r\n  is no god worthy to be&nbsp; worshipped but Allah&rdquo; to love for the sake \r\n  of Allah and to reject for the sake of Allah. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> This is the firmest anchor of belief which materialise the meaning \r\n  of &ldquo;AL WALA&rdquo; and &ldquo;AL BARA&rdquo;. It means that a Muslim should \r\n  love and be loyal to his Muslim brothers. He should, as a practise, dissociate \r\n  himself completely from the unbelievers and refuse to be influenced by them, \r\n  both in wordly and religious matters. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big> We conclude with a humble prayer to Allah that may He cleanse the \r\n  hearts and souls of those who are genuine seekers of truth and may He bless \r\n  the community of believers. <\/big><\/p>\r\n<p><big>Aameen.<\/big> \r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"11134","question_id":"11134","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n         \r\n        <p>What you have said in your question about it being haraam (unlawful)for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man is correct, and there \r\n          is no doubt concerning that.<\/p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n          <\/li>\r\n          <i>\r\n          <p>&#147;And give not (your daughters) in marriage to \r\n            Al-Mushrikoon (polytheists)till they believe&#148; [al-Baqarah 2:221]<\/p>\r\n          <\/i>\r\n          <p>Al-Qurtubi said:<\/p>\r\n          <p>&#147; &#145;<i>And give not (your daughters) in marriage<\/i>&#146; means, do not give Muslim women in marriage to Mushrik (pagan)men.

This time is a\r\n    period of hours, not minutes, so there is bound to be an opportunity to pray within this\r\n    time.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly: there are usually breaks between classes; even if the break\r\n    is only five minutes, you can make the most of it. There are also breaks for recess and\r\n    for lunch during which you could pray. Otherwise you could pray after school is over and\r\n    before the time for the prayer ends. Or you could ask the teacher for permission to leave\r\n    before the class finishes so that you can go and pray. In some countries there are laws\r\n    which enable the followers of different religions to practise the observances of their\r\n    faiths at a specific time during the work or school day, so you could avail yourself of\r\n    these laws if they exist.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whatever the case, whoever fears Allaah and does his duty towards Him,\r\n    Allaah will show him a way out and make things easier for him. When Allaah knows that a\r\n    Muslim is keen to do the obligatory actions, He will help him. Finally, we would like to\r\n    thank you once again for your question. We ask Allaah to guide you to the way of truth\r\n    sooner rather than later, and to grant you good health and keep you safe and sound. May He\r\n    grant you strength and success in your life and keep you safe from all evils.<\/p>\r\n    <p>May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and\r\n    companions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"11137","question_id":"11137","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>And again, praise be to Allaah for having blessed you\r\n    with this conviction about the religion of Islam.

You can\r\n    become Muslim and then learn the religion and develop full conviction about all the\r\n    rulings of Islam. At the beginning, it is sufficient to believe in the six pillars of\r\n    faith in general terms (belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last\r\n    Day and predestination, both good and bad) and to understand and accept in general terms\r\n    the five pillars of Islam (testifying that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is\r\n    the Messenger of Allaah, prayer, paying zakaah, fasting in Ramadaan, and performing Hajj\r\n    to the sacred House of Allaah, for the one who is able and has the means).

We do not think that that you need to be convinced any\r\n    further, but the problems that you talk about have to do with the next step, which is\r\n    really embracing the religion of Islam and starting to practise it by living an Islamic\r\n    life. We do not see any real obstacles that would prevent you from taking this step. Let\r\n    us look at each of these problems in turn.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The first problem is: how will your alcoholic husband react to your\r\n    becoming Muslim? The Islamic ruling is that as soon as you embrace Islam, you start your\r\n    &#145;iddah, which is the waiting period (following dissolution of a marriage).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &#147;According to our\r\n    opinion, if a woman becomes Muslim when her husband is a kaafir, then he becomes Muslim,\r\n    then he has more right (to go back) to her as long as she is still in her &#145;iddah\r\n    period, but if her &#145;iddah has expired, he has no right to go back to her.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Shaafa&#146;i said: &#147;If one of them (the couple) becomes Muslim\r\n    before the marriage is consummated, then their separation takes effect instantly when one\r\n    of them becomes Muslim. If this happens after the marriage has been consummated, then it\r\n    becomes the matter of waiting until three (menstrual periods) have passed.&#148; This is\r\n    if the woman has regular periods; otherwise the waiting period is three months. If the\r\n    other partner becomes Muslim before this time has passed, then their marriage contract\r\n    remains valid. (<i>Tabyeen al-Haqaa&#146;iq Sharh Kanz al-Daqaa&#146;iq<\/i>, part\r\n    2, <i>Baab Nikaah al-Kaafir<\/i>).<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is because a Muslim woman is not allowed to be\r\n    married to a kaafir at all, because Islam should prevail and not be prevailed over.<\/p>\r\n    <p>So become Muslim, and present Islam to him (your husband). If he\r\n    becomes Muslim too, then praise be to Allaah. Maybe this will make him give up alcohol. If\r\n    he does not become Muslim and the &#145;iddah time expires, then leave him, especially as\r\n    his circumstances are not acceptable and and his alcoholism is causing so much trouble for\r\n    you and your children, and living with him is unbearable. Do not feel any regrets about\r\n    him; maybe Allaah will compensate you with someone better than him. If he cannot take care\r\n    of himself, then he only has himself to blame, because he is bringing it upon himself. If\r\n    you leave him, this make him feel bad and thus bring him back to his senses; maybe then he\r\n    will become Muslim and get his wife and children back.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second problem is very serious and dangerous, because it has to do\r\n    with an Islamically unacceptable relationship between a man and a non-mahram woman who\r\n    talk together intimately about all kinds of topics, without any controls or restraints.\r\n    This improper conduct has led to other kinds of improper conduct, namely love and\r\n    attachment and fear of separation from that person, as well as the weighing up of this\r\n    relationship against the religion of Islam &#150; even though continuing this intimate\r\n    relationship is so harmful and entering Islam is obligatory and will bring happiness in\r\n    this world and salvation from the Fire in the Hereafter. Moreover, we are astonished and\r\n    wonder how he can be so committed to his religion &#150; as you say &#150; yet he has\r\n    formed such a relationship with you that you describe him as your friend. You must hasten\r\n    to enter Islam and advise this person in an appropriate fashion (such as sending him an\r\n    e-mail, for example). Rest assured that when you become Muslim, Allaah will make for you a\r\n    way to get out (from difficulty), and He will provide for you from (sources) you could\r\n    never imagine.

As far as your Muslim acquaintances are concerned, \r\n  you will be sitting with their wives, not with the men, as is dictated by Islamic \r\n  teaching.

Women have to pray four rak&rsquo;ahs of Zuhr \r\n  prayer on Friday wherever they are. What you have heard about a person delegating \r\n  someone else to pray on his behalf is not correct at all. Prayer is <i>fard \r\n  &lsquo;ayn<\/i>, i.e., an individual duty for each Muslim, and it is not acceptable \r\n  for one person to appoint someone else as a proxy or for one person to pray \r\n  on behalf of another. In any case, you have no need for this in the case of \r\n  Jumu&rsquo;ah prayers, as you now know.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Briefly, all you need in your case is to put your trust in \r\n  Allaah and strive to please Him.

The key to all of this is to bear witness that\r\n    there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. With regard to\r\n    Hajj, it is not a condition for entering Islam, rather it is one of the pillars and duties\r\n    that come into effect after a person has entered Islam, and it is a duty only for those\r\n    who are able to do it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka&lsquo;bah) is\r\n    a duty that mankind owes to All&acirc;h, those who can afford the expenses (for one&rsquo;s\r\n    conveyance, provision and residence)&rdquo; [Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:97]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>(See Question # [fatin]5261[\\fatin]\r\n    for details on what constitutes being able to go for Hajj).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Obtaining an official certificate from an Islamic centre as proof of\r\n    your Islam so that you can use it to get permission to go for Hajj and enter the Holy\r\n    Places is a means which you must use in order to go for Hajj in the future, but it is not\r\n    a condition that is necessary for you to become Muslim or start to do the acts of worship\r\n    such as Salaah (prayer) etc. When a person becomes Muslim he becomes a member of the\r\n    Muslim Ummah and is connected to all the Muslims who believe in One God by the bonds of\r\n    Islamic brotherhood which includes friendship and mutual help and support, as Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic\r\n    religion)&rdquo; [al-Hujuraat 49:10]<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;The believers, men and women, are Auliya&rsquo; (helpers,\r\n    supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people)\r\n    Al-Ma&lsquo;roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid\r\n    (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam\r\n    has forbidden); they perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey\r\n    Allaah and His Messenger.

Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;And surely, We shall try you till We test those\r\n    who strive hard (for the Cause of Allaah) and the patient ones, and We shall test your\r\n    facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).&#148; [Muhammad 47:31]<\/i>.\r\n    Among the different types of test are the various means which the mushrikeen may employ to\r\n    try to make a believer give up his faith, so they may apply psychological pressure to\r\n    annoy him and make him go back to kufr. Allaah, may He be glorified, has mentioned this in\r\n    His Book and has pointed out how we should respond. He tells us (interpretation of the\r\n    meaning): <i>&#147;You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties\r\n    and in your personal selves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from\r\n    those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who\r\n    ascribe partners to Allaah, but if you persevere patiently, and become al-muttaqoon\r\n    (pious), then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs, and that is from\r\n    the great matters, [which you must hold on to with all your efforts]&#148; [Aal\r\n    &#145;Imraan 3:186].<\/i> <\/p>\r\n    <p>If what is being said or done by others is causing too much\r\n    psychological pain, then how much worse must it be when it is done by the closest of\r\n    people, one with whom you share ties of flesh and blood, the mother who gave birth to you?<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;The hurt caused by those who are related to you is more bitter\r\n    and painful\/ to the soul than the blow of a sword.&#148; [poetry]<\/p>\r\n    <p>But when the believer is exposed to the most painful attacks from the\r\n    closest of people to him, he does not give in or retreat; he follows the Qur&#146;aan in\r\n    his dealings with the mother who is hurting him or cutting him off and turning away from\r\n    him. This is illustrated in the following story:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Mus&#146;ab ibn Sa&#146;d ibn Abi Waqqaas reported from his\r\n    father&#133; the mother of Sa&#146;d swore that she would not speak to him, or eat or\r\n    drink, until he renounced his religion (Islam) and became a kaafir. She said, &#147;You\r\n    claim that Allaah tells you to honour and respect your parents. I am your mother and I am\r\n    telling you to do this.&#148; She stayed like that for three days, until she fell\r\n    unconscious from exhaustion. One of her sons, whose name was &#145;Umaarah, got up and\r\n    gave her water to drink, and she began to pray against Sa&#146;d. Then Allaah revealed the\r\n    following aayah of the Qur&#146;aan (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;And We have\r\n    enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents&#133; But if they (both) strive\r\n    with you to make you join in worship with Me other of which you have no knowledge, the\r\n    obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly&#133;&#148; [Luqmaan 31:14, 15]<\/i>.\r\n    (Reported by Muslim, 4432).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) also suffered rejection at the hands of some of those who were most closely related\r\n    to him, such as his paternal uncle Abu Lahab, but this did not stop him from spreading the\r\n    message and conveying the religion, despite the harshness of the opposition. Rabee&#146;ah\r\n    ibn &#145;Abbaad al-Dayli, who later became Muslim, said: &#147;I saw the Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with my own eyes in the\r\n    marketplace of Dhoo&#146;l-Majaaz, saying, &#145;O people, say <i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i>\r\n    and you will prosper.&#146; He was going through the alleyways of the market, and the\r\n    people were gathering around him. I did not see anyone saying anything, and he did not\r\n    stop saying, &#145;O people, say <i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i> and you will prosper.&#146;\r\n    Behind him there was a man with a squint and a handsome face, and his hair in two braids,\r\n    saying, &#145;He is a Sabian and a liar.&#146; I asked, &#145;Who is this?&#146; They\r\n    said, &#145;Muhammad ibn &#145;Abd-Allaah, who is saying that he is a Prophet.&#146; I\r\n    asked, &#145;Who is this who is denouncing him?&#146; They said, &#145;His paternal uncle\r\n    Abu Lahab.&#146;&#148; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 15448).<\/p>\r\n    <p>So, my sister, you should hold fast to your religion and\r\n    honour and respect your mother as Allaah commands.

No one \r\n          should be in any doubt about this matter. In fact, the Muslim has to \r\n          obey the commands of the Prophet (PBUH), to believe in what he has said, \r\n          to follow his Teachings, to avoid what he has forbidden, and to worship \r\n          A11ah alone according to the message revealed to him.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>What is the meaning of worship?

Becoming Muslim is very easy and anyone can do it even \r\n  if he is all alone in the desert or in a locked room. All it takes is to say \r\n  two beautiful sentences which sum up the meaning of Islam and which include \r\n  the statement that a person is the slave of his Lord and that he submits himself \r\n  to Him and recognizes that He is his God and Helper and Protector Who decrees \r\n  for him whatever He wills; and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allaah \r\n  whom he must follow with regard to what was revealed to him from Allaah, for \r\n  obeying the Messenger is part of obeying Allaah. Whoever utters these twin statements \r\n  of faith, with conviction and believing in them, becomes a Muslim, sharing all \r\n  the rights and duties that other Muslims have. After that he can start straight \r\n  away to do the things that Allaah has made obligatory, such as the five daily \r\n  prayers at the right times, fasting during the month of Ramadaan, and so on. \r\n  From this it should be clear to you that you can become a Muslim straight away, \r\n  so get up, have a shower and say: &ldquo;<i>Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah \r\n  wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &lsquo;abduhu wa rasooluhu<\/i> (I bear witness that \r\n  there is no god except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave \r\n  and Messenger).&rdquo; For more information, see <span> those who want to become Muslim<\/span>.

The Creator knows the situation of His creatures and understands their inabilities,\r\n    weaknesses, forgetfulness and mistakes, and so He forgives us for mistakes that are made\r\n    unintentionally.

Even if a person does commit a haraam deed, Islam still offers a way out from every\r\n    sin, in the form of repentance, remorse, determination not to repeat the sin, and seeking\r\n    forgiveness from Allaah. This guarantees that the sin will be erased. So go ahead with\r\n    determination, and do not hesitate.

This contradicts the historical facts, and does not make sense, because it is \nknown that Ibraaheem and Ismaa&#146;eel were the ones who built the Ka&#146;bah, on the \ncommand of Allaah &#150; how could they then have taken idols out of it? How could there \nhave been any idols in it when they were supervising its construction and maintenance \nby remembering Allaah and calling people to perform Tawaaf around it and come on \npilgrimage to it only for the sake of Allaah? The idols came many years afterwards, \nwhen some of the Arabs travelled to the kaafir lands outside the Arabian Peninsula and \nbrought back idols, some of which were placed around the Ka&#146;bah. Then the \nmushrikeen added more idols until there were 360 of them around the Ka&#146;bah. This \nremained the case until Allaah sent Muhammad <img>\n (peace and blessings of Allaah \nbe upon him). This was the dawning of the light of Tawheed which drove out the \ndarkness of idolatry. Through him, Allaah defeated the mushrikeen; he broke the idols \nand purified the Sacred House, thus restoring the Ka&#146;bah to the pure worship of the \nOne God, as it had been at the time of his forefather Ibraaheem, the Friend (Khaleel) of \nAllaah.<br>\n<br>\nThere follows an account of the building of the Ancient House, from the Qur&#146;aan and \nthe Ahaadeeth of the Prophet <img>\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We \nwill begin by quoting from the Qur&#146;aan, where Allaah says (interpretation of the \nmeaning):<br>\n<br>\n&quot;<em>And (remember) when Ibraaheem said: &#145;My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place \nof security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allaah and \nthe Last Day.&#146; He (Allaah) answered, &#145;As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him \nin contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and \nworst indeed is that destination!&#146;<br>\nAnd (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaa&#146;eel were raising the \nfoundations of the House (the Ka&#146;bah), (saying): &#145;Our Lord! Accept (this service) \nfrom us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.&#146;<br>\n&#145;Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation \nsubmissive unto You, and show us our manaasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage \n&#150;Hajj and &#145;Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who \naccepts repentance, the Most Merciful.<br>\n&#145;Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them \nYour Verses and instruct them in the Book and al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the \nIslamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood, etc.), and sanctify them. \nVerily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.<\/em>&quot;<br>\n[al-Baqarah 2:126-129]<br>\n<br>\n&quot;<em>And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the (Sacred) House, \n(saying): &#145;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for \nthose who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who \nbow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allaah), and make \nprostration (in prayer, etc.)&#146;<br>\nAnd proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage).

In his report, he said:<br>\n&quot;&#133; Ibraaheem brought her and her son Ismaa&#146;eel, while she was still breast-feeding \nhim, and left them in a place near the Ka&#146;bah (meaning near the place where the Ka&#146;bah was later built) under a tree on the spot of Zamzam (meaning the place where Zamzam later appeared), at the \nhighest place in the mosque. In those days there was no-one in Makkah nor was there \nany water. So he left them there and placed near them a leather bag containing some \ndates, and a water-skin containing some water, then he set off for home. Ismaa&#146;eel&#146;s \nmother followed him and said: &#145;O Ibraaheem, where are you going, leaving us in this \nvalley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to \nenjoy)?&#146; She said this many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, \n&#145;Has Allaah commanded you to do this?&#146; He said, &#145;Yes.&#146; She said, &#145;Then He will not \nforsake us,&#146; and returned, while Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached \nal-Thaaniyah, where they could not see him, he turned to face the Ka&#146;bah, raised his \nhands and offered the supplication: &#145;<em>O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring \ndwell in an uncultivable valley, by Your Sacred House in order, O Our Lord, that \nthey may perform al-Salaat (iqaamat al-salaat), so fill some hearts among men with \nlove towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give \nthanks.<\/em>&#146; [Ibraaheem 14:37] <br>\n<br>\nIsmaa&#146;eel&#146;s mother went on suckling Ismaa&#146;eel and drinking from the water (she had). \nWhen the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child \nalso became thirsty. She started looking at him tossing in agony; she left him because \nshe could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safaa&#146; was the \nnearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley \nkeenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she \ndescended from al-Safaa&#146; and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and \nran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and \nreached the mountain of al-Marwa, where she stood and started looking, expecting to \nsee somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between \nal-Safaa&#146; and al-Marwa) seven times.&quot; Ibn &#145;Abbaas said: &quot;The Prophet <img>\n (peace \nand blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#145;This is the origin of the tradition of al-Sa&#146;ee \n(the walking) of people between them (al-Safaa&#146; and al-Marwa).&#146; When she reached \nal-Marwa (for the last time), she heard a voice and she made herself quiet and \nlistened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#145;O (whoever you may be)! You \nhave made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#146; And behold! She \nsaw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till \nwater flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, \nusing her hands in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water from her hands, \nand the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&quot; The Prophet <img>\n \n(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: &quot;May Allaah bestow mercy on \nIsmaa&#146;eel&#146;s mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had \nshe not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a \nstream flowing on the surface of the earth.&quot; The Prophet <img>\n (peace and blessings \nof Allaah be upon him) further added: &quot;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. \nThe angels said to her: &#145;Don&#146;t be afraid of being forsaken, for this is the House of \nAllaah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allaah never forsakes His \npeople.&#146; The House at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when \ntorrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way until some people \nfrom the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they \n(the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kadaa&#146;. They stopped and stayed in the lower \npart of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not \nleaving it. They said, &#145;This bird must be flying around water, although we know that \nthere is no water in this valley.&#146; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the \nsource of water, and returned to inform them about it. So, they all came (towards the \nwater).&quot; The Prophet <img>\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: \n&quot;Ismaa&#146;eel&#146;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, &#145;Do you allow us to \nstay with you?&#146; She replied, &#145;Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#146; \nThey agreed to that.&quot; The Prophet <img>\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \nfurther added: &quot;Ismaa&#146;eel&#146;s mother was pleased with the whole situation, as she used to \nlove to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent \nfor their families who came and settled with them so that some families became \npermanent residents there. The child (Ismaa&#146;eel) grew up and learnt Arabic from them, \nand (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up. When he reached \nthe age of puberty, they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After \nIsmaa&#146;eel&#146;s mother had died, Ibraaheem came after Ismaa&#146;eel&#146;s marriage in order to \nsee his family that he had left before &#133; Then Ibraaheem came and saw Ismaa&#146;eel under \na tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to \nwelcome him and they greeted one another as a father greets his son or a son greets his \nfather. Ibraaheem said, &#145;O Ismaa&#146;eel, Allaah has given me an order.&#146; Ismaa&#146;eel said: \n&#145;Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.&#146; Ibraaheem asked, &#145;Will you help me?&#146; \nIsmaa&#146;eel said, &#145;I will help you.&#146; Ibraaheem said, &#145;Allaah has ordered me to build a \nhouse here,&#146; pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&quot; The Prophet \n<img>\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: &quot;Then they raised the \nfoundations of the House (Ka&#146;bah). Ismaa&#146;eel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was \nbuilding, and when the walls became high, Ismaa&#146;eel brought this stone and put it for \nIbraaheem, who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaa&#146;eel was handing him \nthe stones, and both of them were saying: &#145;<em>Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. \nVerily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.<\/em>&#146; [al-Baqarah 2:127]. The Prophet \n<img>\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, &quot;Then both of them went \non building and going around the Ka&#146;bah saying, &#145;Our Lord!

This is an extremely odd idea. How can the name of the Creator, the Evolver, \nthe First, the Almighty, the Compellor be derived from the name of a created idol that \ncould neither benefit nor harm anyone?<br>\n<br>\nAllaah says, rebuking the mushrikeen (polytheists) (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;<em>Yet \nthey have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves \ncreated, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of \ncausing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead.<\/em>&quot; [al-Furqaan 25:3]<br>\n<br>\n&quot;<em>You worship besides Allaah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those \nwhom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your \nprovision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To \nHim (Alone) you will be brought back.<\/em>&quot; [al-&#145;Ankaboot 29:17]<br>\n<br>\nAllaah describes how Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) rebuked his father and his \npeople for worshipping idols (interpretation of the meaning):<br>\n&quot;<em>When he said to his father: &#145;O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, \nsees not and cannot avail you in anything?<\/em>&quot; [Maryam 19:42]<br>\n<br>\n&quot;<em>And recite to them the story of Ibraaheem, when he said to his father and his \npeople: &#145;What do you worship?&#146; They said: &#145;We worship idols, and to them we are \never devoted.&#146; He said, &#145;Do they hear you, when you call (on them)? Or do they \nbenefit you or do they harm (you)?&#146; They said, &#145;Nay, but we found our fathers doing \nso.&#146; He said, &#145;Do you observe that which you have been worshipping, - you and your \nancient fathers? &#150; Verily! They are enemies to me, save the Lord of the &#145;Aalameen \n(makind, jinn and everything that exists), Who has created me, and it is He Who \nguides me.<\/em>&quot; [Al-Shu&#146;araa&#146; 26:69-78]<br>\n<br>\nConcerning Ibraaheem&#146;s destruction of his people&#146;s idols, Allaah says (interpretation \nof the meaning):<br>\n&quot;<em>Then he turned to their gods and said, &#145;Will you not eat (of the offering before you)? \nWhat is the matter with you that you speak not?&#146; Then he turned upon them, striking \n(them) with (his) right hand. Then they (the worshippers of idols) came towards him, \nhastening. He said, &#145;Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve? While Allaah \nhas created you and what you make?&#146;<\/em>&quot; [al-Saaffaat 37:91-96]<br>\n<br>\nAfter reading all this, how can it be said that Ibraaheem left one idol near the Ka&#146;bah, \nand that the name of Allaah is derived from the name of an idol? Do you know what \n&quot;Allaah&quot; means and where this name is derived from?<br>\n<br>\nThe blessed name &quot;Allaah&quot; is derived from the Arabic verb alaha\/ya&#146;lahu\/ma&#146;looh [the \nroot of which is the three letters alif, laam, haa&#146;]. This verb includes the meaning of love \nas well as worship. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the One Who is loved, \nglorified and feared by the believers, and they put their hope in Him.<br>\n<br>\nAs regards to your last question, about whether Islam has anything to do with the \nworship of idols or heavenly bodies, this is a strange matter indeed. Islam proclaimed \nthe absolute unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and taught that He Alone is to be worshipped, \nwith no partners or associates. Islam came to fight idolatry and put an end to it, so how \ncan it possibly be connected to idol-worship?<br>\n<br>\nPerhaps you have read in the Qur&#146;aan the story of the hoopoe who believed only in \nAllaah; he knew Who his Lord was, and denounced the worship of stars and planets. \nAllaah says, relating how His Prophet Sulaymaan (upon whom be peace) conveyed the \nstory to the queen of Yemen at that time (interpretation of the meaning):<br>\n<br>\n&quot;<em>[The hoopoe said] &#145;&#133; and I have come to you from Saba&#146; (Sheba) with true news. I \nfound a woman ruling over them, and she has been given all things that could be \npossessed by any ruler of the earth, and she has a great throne. I found her and her \npeople worshipping the sun instead of Allaah, and Shaytaan has made their deeds \nfair-seeming to them, and has barred them from (Allaah&#146;s) Way, so they have no \nguidance, so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allaah, Who brings to light \nwhat is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what \nyou reveal. Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the \nSupreme Throne!<\/em>&quot; [al-Naml 27:22-26]<br>\n<br>\nThere is also the story of how Ibraaheem rebuked his people for worshipping heavenly \nbodies, the sun and moon, which Allaah has told us in Soorat al-An&#146;aam (the sixth \nsoorah).<br>\n<br>\nThe fast of Ramadaan is not connected to the moon because we worship the moon, \nbut because the Lord of the moon has made it a marker of time for us, by which we \nmay organize our worship and other affairs. So we look for the new moon of \nRamadaan so that we may worship Allaah Alone by fasting, and we look for the new \nmoon of the following month to mark the end of this annual act of worship. We also \nlook for the timings of Hajj and other acts of worship in a similar way.<br>\n<br>\nWe hope that this has helped you understand anything that was not clear to you before. \nNote that this is a serious issue, and it is not something to be taken lightly. The only \nreligion with Allaah is Islam, which He has chosen for His slaves, and He will not \naccept any other religion. Come and join the religion of truth, and follow what your \nLord has revealed.<\/div>\n\t\t<div>Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"},{"id":"11151","question_id":"11151","answers":"<align>Praise be to Allaah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<align>Your husband is preventing you from embracing Islam, and does not want to become \r\nMuslim himself.

If this man is as you say, he is no good from either a religious or a \r\nworldly point of view, and there is no use in staying with him. Our advice to you in this \r\ncase is to leave him immediately, and try hard to gain custody of your two daughters so \r\nthat they may grow up in Islam. According to Islamic sharee&#146;ah, in such cases custody \r\nshould be awarded to the Muslim parent, because Islam should prevail, not be \r\nprevailed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs regards the second part of your question, and this man whom you say is a Muslim, \r\nyou must make sure that he is a chaste man, not one who is immoral or corrupt.

The pleasures of\r\n        Paradise are not merely physical in nature, they also include the joy of feeling safe and\r\n        secure, and of being content with God and being close to Him. The greatest joy of all in\r\n        Paradise will be seeing God, may He be glorified and exalted. When the people of Paradise\r\n        see the Holy Face of God, they will forget all other kinds of pleasures that they have\r\n        enjoying. There is in Paradise everything that will delight the heart and eye; no dirty or\r\n        evil talk is heard there, nor sinful speech. <i>&#147;No person know what is kept hidden\r\n        for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.&#148; [al-Sajdah 32:17 &#150;\r\n        interpretation of the meaning]. <\/i>What I am trying to say is that the delights of\r\n        Paradise are not limited to the kind you refer to in your question. They are far greater\r\n        than that.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>You mention the idea that entrance to Paradise will only be granted to\r\n        those who heed certain prohibitions, which things they will enjoy in Paradise in the\r\n        Hereafter as a reward for avoiding it in this life. This generalization is not correct at\r\n        all. Islam is a religion which commands action, not just abstinence. Salvation can only be\r\n        attained through fulfilling commands, not just by avoiding things that are forbidden.\r\n        Moreover, not every luxury in Paradise will consist of something that was forbidden in\r\n        this world and is now being given as a reward. Some of the delights of Paradise will be\r\n        things that were allowed in this world, such as marriage, good fruits like pomegranate and\r\n        figs, etc., drinks like milk and honey, and so on. All of these are permitted in this\r\n        world, and will be delights to be enjoyed in Paradise. The bad qualities of things that\r\n        are forbidden in this world will not be present in their heavenly forms. For example, the\r\n        wine of Paradise, as Allaah tells us, causes neither <i>ghoul<\/i> (any kind of hurt,\r\n        abdominal pain, headache, sin, etc.) nor intoxication (see al-Saffaat 37:47). It does not\r\n        rob a person of his mental faculties, or cause headaches and stomachaches. It is quite\r\n        different from its earthly counterpart. The point I am making is that the delights of\r\n        Paradise do not consist only of allowing things that were forbidden in this world. It is\r\n        also worth pointing out that there are cases where abstention from prohibited things will\r\n        not be rewarded by being given their equivalent in the Hereafter, whether those prohibited\r\n        things are food, drinks, deeds or words. Poison, for example, will not be given as a\r\n        luxury in Paradise, although it is forbidden in this world. The same applies to sodomy,\r\n        incest and other things which will not be allowed in the Hereafter although they are\r\n        forbidden in this world. This matter is quite clear, praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The idea of being guaranteed Paradise, and that a person&#146;s life\r\n        will be as horrible and unbearable as you describe if he has no such guarantee, is a\r\n        misconception which itself leads to the results you mention. If you were to say that every\r\n        person has a guarantee of Paradise, this would be utterly disastrous, because then\r\n        everyone would commit all kinds of forbidden acts, feeling safe because of this guarantee.\r\n        Many of the crimes committed by Jews and Christians have been done on the basis of this\r\n        guarantee, with documents of forgiveness from their priests. Allaah has told us about such\r\n        people (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;And they say, &#145;None shall enter Paradise unless he be a\r\n      Jew or a Christian.&#146; Say, &#145;Produce your proof if you are truthful.&#146;&#148; <\/p>\r\n      <p>[al-Baqarah 2:111]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>For us Muslims, Paradise is not the matter of our own desires or\r\n      the desires of anyone else, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor\r\n      those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians); whoever works evil will have\r\n      the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allaah.&#148;\r\n      [al-Nisa&#146; 4:123]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>There follows a brief summary of the Islamic view regarding a\r\n      guarantee of one&#146;s destiny.<\/p>\r\n      <p>Islam offers a guarantee to every sincere Muslim who obeys Allaah and\r\n      remains in this state of devotion until he dies, that he will definitely enter Paradise.\r\n      Allaah says in the Qur&#146;aan (interpretation of the meanings):<\/p>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall\r\n      admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow (i.e., in Paradise), to dwell therein\r\n      forever.

(Of course, none).&#148; [al-Nisa&#146; 4:122]<\/p>\r\n      <p>&#147;Allaah has promised those who believe and do deeds of\r\n      righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e.,\r\n      Paradise).&#148; [al-Maa&#146;idah 5:9]<\/p>\r\n      <p>&#147;(They will enter) &#145;Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting\r\n      Gardens), which the Most Beneficent (Allaah) has promised to His servants in the unseen:\r\n      verily, His promise must come to pass.&#148; [Maryam 19:61]<\/p>\r\n      <p>&#147;Say: &#145;Is that (torment) better, or the Paradise of Eternity\r\n      promised to the muttaqeen (pious and righteous persons)?

(This is) the Promise of Allaah, and Allaah does not fail in (His)\r\n      promise.&#148; [al-Zumar 39:20]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>Islam also guarantees the disbeliever who ignores the commands of\r\n      Allaah that he will definitely enter Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):<\/p>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;Allaah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the\r\n      disbelievers, the Fire of Hell, therein shall they abide.

He describes how both of them will be at the end of the Day of Judgement\r\n      (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of\r\n      the Fire (saying): &#145;We have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you\r\n      also found true, what your Lord promised (warnings, etc.)?&#146; They shall say,\r\n      &#145;Yes.&#146; Then a crier will proclaim between them: &#145;The Curse of Allaah is on\r\n      the zaalimeen (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.).&#148; [al-A&#146;raaf 7:44]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>Everyone who believes and does righteous deeds, and dies in this\r\n      state, will definitely enter Paradise. Everyone who disbelieves and does evil deeds, and\r\n      dies in this state, will definitely enter Hell. <\/p>\r\n      <p>One of the great guiding principles of Islam is that the believer\r\n      should tread a path between fear and hope. He should not take it for granted that he will\r\n      enter Paradise, because this will make him complacent, and he does not know in what state\r\n      he will die. Nor should he assume that he is going to Hell, because this is despairing of\r\n      the mercy of Allaah, which is forbidden. So the believer does righteous deeds, and hopes\r\n      that Allaah will reward him for them, and he avoids evil deeds out of fear of the\r\n      punishment of Allaah. If he commits a sin, he repents in order to gain forgiveness and\r\n      protect himself from the punishment of Hell. Allaah forgives all sins and accepts the\r\n      repentance of those who repent. If a believer fears that the good deeds he has sent on\r\n      before him are not enough, as you suggest, then he will increase his efforts, in fear and\r\n      hope. No matter how many righteous deeds he has sent on before him, he cannot rely on them\r\n      and take them for granted, or else he will be doomed. He keeps striving and hoping for\r\n      reward, and at the same time he fears lest his deeds be contaminated with any element of\r\n      showing off, self-admiration, or anything that will lead to them being rejected by Allaah.\r\n      Allaah describes the believers (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;&#133; those who give that (their charity) which they give (and\r\n      also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charity,\r\n      etc.) have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their Lord (for\r\n      reckoning).&#148; [al-Mu&#146;minoon 23:60]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>So the believer keeps on striving, fearing and hoping, until he\r\n      meets his Lord, believing in Tawheed (Divine Unity) and doing righteous deeds, and earns\r\n      the pleasure of his Lord and Paradise. If you think about the matter, you will realize\r\n      that these are the right motives for action, and that righteousness cannot be achieved in\r\n      this life in any other way.<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>As regards what you say about original sin, this matter needs to be\r\n        approached from several angles.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>Firstly: The Islamic belief concerning human sin is: the individual\r\n      bears the responsibility for his own sin; no one else should bear this burden for him, nor\r\n      should he bear the burden for anyone else. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;And\r\n      no bearer of burdens shall bear another&#146;s burden&#133;&#148; [Faatir 35:18]<\/i>. This\r\n      refutes the idea of original sin. If the father commits a sin, what fault is that of his\r\n      children and grandchildren? Why should they bear the burden of a sin that someone else\r\n      committed? The Christian belief that the descendents should bear the sin of their father\r\n      is the essence of injustice. How can any sane person say that the sin should be carried\r\n      down the centuries by all of humanity, or that the children, grandchildren and subsequent\r\n      descendants should be tainted because of their father&#146;s sin?<\/p>\r\n      <p>Secondly, making mistakes is a part of human nature. Our Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &#147;Every son of Aadam is bound to\r\n      commit sins&#133;&#148; (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2423), but Allaah has not left man\r\n      unable to do anything about the mistakes that he makes. He gives man the opportunity to\r\n      repent, and so the hadeeth (words of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n      him) quoted above concludes: &#147;&#133;and the best of those who commit sins are those\r\n      who repent.&#148; The mercy of Allaah is clear in the teachings of Islam, as Allaah calls\r\n      His servants (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;Say, &#145;O My servants who have\r\n      transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the\r\n      Mercy of Allaah, verily Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most\r\n      Merciful.&#148; [al-Zumar 39:53]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>This is human nature, and this is the solution to the problem of\r\n      sin. But to make this human nature, which is bound to make mistakes, a barrier between the\r\n      servant and his Lord which will prevent him from ever earning the pleasure of God, and to\r\n      say that the only way to reach God is through His sending His (so-called) son down to\r\n      earth to be humiliated and crucified while his father looks on, so that mankind could be\r\n      forgiven, is an extremely odd idea. Just describing it sounds so unlikely that there is no\r\n      longer any need to refute it in detail. Once, when discussing this issue with a Christian,\r\n      I said, &#147;If you say that God sent down His son to be crucified to atone for the sins\r\n      of the people alive at his time and afterwards, what about those who had come before and\r\n      died as sinners before the time of Christ, and had no opportunity to know about him and\r\n      believe in the Crucifixion so that their sins might be forgiven?&#148; All he could say\r\n      was: &#147;No doubt our priests have an answer to that!&#148; Even if they do have an\r\n      answer, it is bound to be concocted. There is no real answer.<\/p>\r\n      <p>If you really examine the Christian teaching on human sin with an open\r\n      mind, you will see that they say that God sacrificed His only son to atone for the sins of\r\n      mankind, and that this son was a god. If it was true that he was a god who was beaten,\r\n      insulted and crucified, and died, then this doctrine contains elements of blasphemy\r\n      because it accuses God of weakness and helplessness. Is God really incapable of forgiving\r\n      the sins of all His servants with just one word? If He is Able to do all things (and the\r\n      Christians do not dispute this fact), then why would He need to sacrifice His son in order\r\n      to achieve the same thing? (Glorified and exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say\r\n      about Him!) <\/p>\r\n      <i><p>&#147;He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He\r\n      have children when He has no wife? He created all things and He is the All-Knower of\r\n      everything.&#148; [al-An&#146;aam 6:101 &#150; interpretation of the meaning]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i><p>An ordinary man would not accept anyone harming his child; he would\r\n      come to his defence, and would never hand him over to an enemy who would insult him, let\r\n      alone leave him to face the worst kind of death. If this is the attitude of a mere created\r\n      being, what then of the Creator?<\/p>\r\n      <p>Thirdly, the Christian doctrine of original sin has a negative effect\r\n      because, as you have mentioned, it does not require any duties of man other than to\r\n      believe that God sent His son to this earth to be crucified and to die to atone for the\r\n      sins of mankind. Thus a person becomes a Christian and is to earn the pleasure of God and\r\n      be admitted to heaven. Moreover, the Christian believes that everything that happened to\r\n      the son of God was only to atone for his sins, past present and future, so there is no\r\n      need to wonder why Christian societies have seen such an increase in murder, rape,\r\n      robbery, alcoholism and other problems. After all, did not Christ die to atone for their\r\n      sins, and haven&#146;t their sins been wiped out, so why should they stop doing these\r\n      things? Tell me, by your Lord, why do you sometimes execute murderers, or put criminals in\r\n      jail, or punish them in other ways, if you believe that the criminal&#146;s sins have all\r\n      be atoned for and forgiven through the blood of Christ? Is this not a strange\r\n      contradiction?<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>You ask why, if the Muslims are the chosen people of mankind, they do\r\n        not spread their religion. The fact of the matter is that sincere Muslims have always\r\n        sought to do just that. How else could Islam have spread from Makkah to Indonesia,\r\n        Siberia, North Africa, Bosnia, South Africa and all parts of the world, East and West? The\r\n        faults in the behaviour of some modern Muslims cannot be blamed on Islam; those faults are\r\n        the result of going against Islamic teachings. It is not fair to blame the religion for\r\n        the faults of some of its adherents who have gone against it or gone astray. Are Muslims\r\n        not being more just than Christians when they affirm that the sinner is threatened with\r\n        the punishment of Allaah unless he repents, and that for some sins there is a deterrent, a\r\n        punishment to be carried out in this world as an expiation for the Hereafter, as in the\r\n        case of the punishments for murder, theft, fornication\/adultery, etc.?<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>What you say about it be so easy to become a Christian, as compared to\r\n        becoming a Muslim, is clearly mistaken. The key to Islam is no more than two simple\r\n        phrases: &#147;<i>Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa anna Muhammadan Rasool-Allaah<\/i>\r\n        (I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of\r\n        Allaah).&#148; With these few words, a person enters Islam in a matter of seconds. There\r\n        is no need for baptism or priests, or even to go to a certain place such as a mosque or\r\n        anywhere else. Compare this with the ridiculous procedures of baptism which the Christians\r\n        do when they want to admit someone to the Church. Then there is the fact that the\r\n        Christians venerate the cross on which Jesus was tortured and crucified in great pain\r\n        &#150; as they claim. They take it as a sacred object of blessing and healing, instead of\r\n        scorning it and hating it as a symbol of oppression and the worst possible way for the son\r\n        of God to die! <\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Do you not see that the Muslims are closer than others to the truth,\r\n        because they believe in all the Prophets and Messengers, respecting them all and\r\n        recognizing that all of them taught the truth of Divine Unity (Tawheed) and that each of\r\n        them was appointed by Allaah and sent to his people with laws that were appropriate to the\r\n        time and place? When the fair-minded Christian sees the followers of Islam believing in\r\n        Musa (Moses), &#145;Eesaa (Jesus), and Muhammad <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n        him) and in the original Torah and Gospel, as well as the Qur&#146;aan, and sees his own\r\n        people denying the Prophethood of Muhammad <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n        and rejecting the Qur&#146;aan, wouldn&#146;t his open-mindedness make him think that the\r\n        Muslims are most likely to be right?<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>You say that the Messiah said, &#147;No one comes to the Father except\r\n        through me&#148;. We need, first of all, to be sure that these words can truly be\r\n        attributed to Jesus. Secondly, this is clearly not true. How then could mankind have known\r\n        God at the times of Nooh (Noah), Hood, Saalih, Yoonus (Jonah), Shu&#146;ayb (Jethro),\r\n        Ibraaheem (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and other Prophets? If you were to say that during the\r\n        time of Jesus (upon whom be peace) and up to the time of the Final Prophet, Muhammad <img>\r\n\r\n        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Children of Israel had no other way to\r\n        know the religion of Allaah except through the way of Jesus, this would be correct.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Finally, you quote the Messiah as saying, &#147;I and the Father are\r\n        one&#148;. This is clearly not correct. If we examine the matter objectively, without\r\n        letting our own desires get in the way, it becomes clear that the conjunction\r\n        &#147;and&#148; in the phrase &#147;I and the Father&#148; implies that two separate\r\n        entities are involved. &#147;I&#148; is one entity, and &#147;the Father&#148; is another.\r\n        If you say, &#147;So-and-so and I&#148;, it is obvious to any rational person that they\r\n        are two separate people. The equation 1+1+1=1 makes no sense to any rational person,\r\n        whether he is a mathematician or not.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Finally, I advise you (and I do not think that you will reject this\r\n    advice) to think deeply about what you have read, putting aside your background, any\r\n    pre-conceived ideas, your own desires and feelings of attachment to your religion or\r\n    culture, and to seek guidance sincerely from Allaah.

Its call is distinguished from others by its realism, balance and\r\n    moderation. Islam pays due attention to both the soul and the body. It neither suppresses\r\n    physical desires nor allows extravagance in this regard; it makes a distinction between\r\n    the natural inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this world and forbidden desires that\r\n    come under the heading of depravity and perversion.<\/p>\r\n    <p>People embrace Islam because they find security, comfort and peace in\r\n    it, they see a cure for their problems in it, and through it they are able to get rid of\r\n    their feelings of confusion, anxiety and loss.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Islam is the religion of the fitrah, the natural inclination or pattern\r\n    on which Allaah has created mankind. For this reason, people of sound minds and upright\r\n    inclinations embrace Islam, as Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:\r\n    &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &lsquo;There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (i.e., Islam), then his\r\n    parents make him into a Jew, a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian), just as animals\r\n    produce whole animals (i.e., the animals are born perfect with no part of their bodies\r\n    missing). Do you find any born with their ears cut off?&rsquo;&rdquo; Then Abu Hurayrah (may\r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo; <i>&lsquo;&hellip; Allaah&rsquo;s handiwork according\r\n    to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work\r\n    (wrought) by Allaah: that is the Standard Religion&hellip;&rsquo; [al-Room 30:30 &ndash;\r\n    interpretation of the meaning &ndash; Yusuf Ali&rsquo;s translation]<\/i>.&rdquo; (Reported\r\n    by al-Bukhaari, 1359). What is meant is that Allaah has created mankind\r\n    with the potential to learn the truth, accept Tawheed (pure monotheism) and submit to\r\n    Allaah. Their natural inclination is to learn Islam and love it, but a bad education, a disbelieving environment, their own whims and desires and the devils among jinn\r\n    and mankind turn them away from the truth. Mankind is basically inclined towards Tawheed\r\n    (pure monotheism), as the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reported\r\n    that his Lord (Allaah) said: &ldquo;I created all my slaves as &lsquo;hunafa&rsquo; (pure\r\n    monetheists), but the devils turned them away from their religion.&rdquo; (Reported\r\n    by Muslim). For this reason the one who becomes a Muslim after having been\r\n    a disbeliever is described as having &ldquo;reverted&rdquo; to Islam, as this is more\r\n    correct than saying that he &ldquo;converted.&rdquo; When Islam enters a country where there\r\n    is no nationalism or great legacy of jaahiliyah (ignorance), it spreads quickly because of\r\n    its strength and the small number of obstacles. You may also see that Islam is suitable\r\n    for all people, educated and uneducated, male and female, old and young; everyone finds in\r\n    it what he wants and needs. Those who become Muslim in developed countries realize what\r\n    their country&rsquo;s civilization and laws, which have been fabricated from men&rsquo;s\r\n    whims and desires, have done to them, and they realize the extent of the misery in which\r\n    people in developed countries are living. They see how prevalent psychological illnesses,\r\n    nervous breakdowns, insanity and suicides are, despite the technological advances and\r\n    great number of discoveries and inventions and modern systems of management. This is\r\n    because all of that is concerned only with the physical and the outward, but it neglects\r\n    the inward and fails to nourish and nurture the heart and soul. Allaah says of these\r\n    people (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;They know only the outside appearance of\r\n    the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.&rdquo; [al-Room 30:7]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Islam will continue to succeed, with the permission of Allaah, so long\r\n    as those who work for its sake are sincere and its followers adhere to it and believe in\r\n    it, and apply its laws.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fact that there are those who are not committed or who fall short will\r\n    not prevent Islam from succeeding, with the permission of Allaah, and nothing can distort\r\n    its beauty. Its light will not falter because some people abandon it or fail to adhere to\r\n    it.

The confusion and hesitation that you\r\n    describe are quite understandable, because when a person has been indulging in forbidden\r\n    relationships and then wishes to move to a religion of purity and chastity, it is natural\r\n    to feel that his own &#147;nafs&#148; (desires) will defeat him and that he will not be\r\n    able to do what Islam requires of him in the way of purity and chastity. But we will tell\r\n    you some things here which we hope will help you to overcome any difficulty that you may\r\n    be fearing and give a true picture of the situation.<\/p>\r\n    <p>When a person follows the true religion, it is expected to have a\r\n    far-reaching effect on his personality and behaviour, so that it re-forms him and gives\r\n    him a fresh start and a new direction in life, completely different from the way he was\r\n    during his &#147;jaahiliyyah&#148; (days of ignorance before his Islam). This radical\r\n    change will produce morals and values that were not there before, which will purify his\r\n    heart and fill him with a sense of chastity, so that the new Muslim looks with revulsion\r\n    and disgust both at his own former deeds and at the ignorant world of promiscuity,\r\n    infidelity, nakedness and utter corruption that exists in the society around him. He will\r\n    come back to the sound nature (fitrah &#150; the natural state of man) and purity of heart\r\n    of which Shaytaan had robbed him during the days when he was a non-Muslim and sinner. This new\r\n    direction in life is undertaken freely, by choice, and is accompanied by contentment and\r\n    acceptance stemming from his total submission to the commands and prohibitions of Allaah,\r\n    Who revealed this religion of Islam with all its laws. We have two sources of proof to\r\n    support what we say here, one from the sharee&#146;ah (Islamic law)and one from history.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The shar&#146;i(textual) evidence is to be found in numerous places in the Qur&#146;aan, for example (interpretation of the meanings):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and by disbelief)\r\n    and We gave him life (by knowledge and by faith) and set for him a light (of Belief)\r\n    whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism\r\n    and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out?&#133;&#148; [al-An&#146;aam 6:122]<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;And those who invoke not any other god along with Allaah, nor kill\r\n    such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual\r\n    intercourse &#150; and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will\r\n    abide therein in disgrace,<\/p>\r\n    <\/i><p><i>Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, for\r\n    those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most\r\n    Merciful.&#148; [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Concerning the phrase &#147;Allaah will change their sins into good\r\n    deeds&#148; the mufassireen (commentators) said: their evil deeds will be replaced by good\r\n    deeds. &#145;Ali ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn &#145;Abbaas said: &#147;These are the\r\n    believers, who before they believed did evil deeds, but Allaah wanted them to do something\r\n    else, so He changed their bad deeds into good deeds&#133;&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;Ataa&#146; ibn Abi Rabaah said: &#147;This is in this world: a man\r\n    may be doing evil but then Allaah replaces it with good.&#148; Sa&#146;eed ibn Jubayr\r\n    said: &#147;Allaah changed them from worshippers of idols into worshippers of the Most\r\n    Merciful, and changed them from those who fight the Muslims into those who fight the\r\n    (polytheists), and from those who marry mushrik (polytheist)women into those who marry\r\n    believing women.&#148; Al-Hasan al-Basri said: &#147;Allaah changed them from evil deeds\r\n    to good deeds, from shirk (polytheism) to ikhlaas (purity of faith), from promiscuity to\r\n    chastity, from disbelief to Islam.&#148; This is the view of Abu &#145;Aaliyah, Qutaadah and a\r\n    group of others. (Ibn Katheer, <i>Tafseer al-Qur&#146;aan al-&#145;Azeem<\/i>).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The historical evidence includes a number of stories of\r\n    Muslims who entered Islam after having been (disbelievers), and how they changed\r\n    and became righteous. Among these stories is the following:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;There was a (Muslim) man called Marthad ibn Abi Marthad who used to\r\n    smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah (which was the territory of the mushrikeen) to\r\n    Madeenah (which was the territory of the Muslims). There was also a woman in Makkah,\r\n    called &#145;Anaaq, who was a prostitute. She had been a friend of Marthad&#146;s (before\r\n    he became Muslim). Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to\r\n    Madeenah. He said: &#147;I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit\r\n    night, then &#145;Anaaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she\r\n    recognized me and said: &#145;Marthad?&#146; I said, &#145;Marthad.&#146; She said:\r\n    &#145;Welcome! Stay with us tonight.&#146; I said, &#145;O &#145;Anaaq, Allaah has\r\n    forbidden zinaa (unlawful sexual relations).&#146; She called out, &#145;O people of the\r\n    camp! This man is stealing away your prisoners!&#146; (i.e., she wanted to take revenge on\r\n    him because he refused to have unlawful relations with her, so she called the polytheists to come and seize him). Eight men pursued me (and he described how Allaah saved him from\r\n    them).&#148; This event was the reason for the revelation of the verse (interpretation of\r\n    the meaning): <i>&#147;Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman\r\n    similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such\r\n    a woman; to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.&#148; [al-Noor 24:3 &#150; Yusuf\r\n    &#145;Ali&#146;s translation]<\/i> (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi,\r\n    3101).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason for telling this story is that it illustrates\r\n    how this man changed after he embraced Islam, and refused to commit the haraam deed with\r\n    which he was tempted. Another story describes a woman who embraced Islam and became\r\n    righteous:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#145;Abd-Allaah ibn Maghfal reported that there was a woman who had been\r\n    a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam).

We\r\n    will tell you the story of a great Muslim woman; we hope that you will find what you are\r\n    looking for, and that this will be a light to guide you to the path of Truth.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Maalik ibn Anas said to his wife Um Sulaym &#150; who was the mother of\r\n    Anas &#150; &#147;This man &#150; meaning the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) &#150; is forbidding alcohol.&#148; So he left Madeenah and went to Shaam\r\n    (Syria), where he died. (i.e., he fled from Madeenah when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) came there, because he did not like the ban on alcohol,\r\n    and he died as a kaafir or non-believer in Syria). Then Abu Talhah came and proposed\r\n    marriage to Um Sulaym, and spoke to her about it. She said, &#147;O Abu Talhah, a man like\r\n    you would not be turned down, but you are a non-believer, and I am a Muslim woman. It is\r\n    not right for me to marry you.&#148; He said, &#147;This is the chance of a\r\n    lifetime!&#148; She said, &#147;What chance?&#148; He said, &#147;The yellow and white\r\n    (i.e., he was tempting her with a mahr or dowry of gold and silver).&#148; She said,\r\n    &#147;I do not want any yellow or white. I want you to become Muslim. If you become\r\n    Muslim, that will be my mahr, and I will not ask you for anything else.&#148; He asked,\r\n    &#147;Who could help me with that (i.e., to become Muslim)?&#148; She said, &#147;The\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will help you.&#148; So\r\n    Abu Talhah went to look for the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who\r\n    was sitting with his Companions. When he [the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him)] saw him, he said, &#147;Abu Talhah is coming to you with the light of Islam\r\n    shining on his forehead.&#148; (This was one of the miracles of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): he knew that Abu Talhah would become a Muslim even\r\n    before he spoke). Abu Talhah told the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) about what Um Sulaym had said, and he married her on that basis. Thaabit\r\n    (i.e., Thaabit al-Banaani, one of the people who narrated the story from Anas) said:\r\n    &#147;We have never heard of any mahr greater than this, she accepted his Islam as her\r\n    dowry.&#148; <\/p>\r\n    <p>So he married her, and she was a woman with nice eyes, rather small.\r\n    She was with him until she bore him a son, who Abu Talhah loved very much. The child\r\n    became very ill, and Abu Talhah was very upset and distressed by the child&#146;s\r\n    sickness. Abu Talhah used to get up to pray the morning prayer, he would go to the Prophet\r\n<img>\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and pray with him, and would stay with him for\r\n    almost half the day. Then [Abu Talhah] would come to take a nap and eat, and when he had\r\n    prayed Zuhr [mid-day prayer] he would get ready and leave, and would not come back until\r\n    the time of the &#145;Isha&#146; [night-time] prayer. One evening, Abu Talhah went out to\r\n    see the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (according to another report:\r\n    to go to the mosque), and the child died (during his absence). Um Sulaym said, &#147;No\r\n    one is to tell Abu Talhah about his child&#146;s death until I have told him.&#148; She\r\n    covered the child up as if he were sleeping, and left him in a corner of the house. Abu\r\n    Talhah came back from visiting the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him), and brought some people from the mosque with him. He asked, &#147;How is my\r\n    son?&#148; She said, &#147;O Abu Talhah, from the time he fell sick, he has never been as\r\n    calm as he is now, and I hope that he is resting.&#148; (She spoke vaguely so as not to\r\n    upset him; this was not a lie. She was referring to the calmness of death and the child\r\n    finding relief from the pain of his sickness, but her husband took it to mean that the\r\n    child&#146;s condition had improved). She brought the meal and they all ate dinner, then\r\n    the people left. Then he went to bed and lay down, and she got up and put on perfume and\r\n    adorned herself, making herself more beautiful than she ever had before. (This was a sign\r\n    of her patience and great faith in the will and decree of Allaah. She was seeking reward\r\n    from Allaah and concealing her feelings, hoping that she would become pregnant that night\r\n    to make up for the loss of her child). Then she came and lay down in the bed with him, and\r\n    when he smelt the perfume, he did as men usually do with their wives (this is the\r\n    narrator&#146;s polite and circumspect manner of referring to what happened between them).\r\n    At the end of the night, she said, &#147;O Abu Talhah, do you think that if some people\r\n    lent something to some others, then they asked for it back, do they have the right not to\r\n    give it back?&#148; He said, &#147;No.&#148; She said, &#147;Allaah, may He be glorified,\r\n    lent your son to you, and now He has taken him back, so seek reward with Him and have\r\n    patience.&#148; He became angry and said, &#147;You left me until I did what I did (i.e.,\r\n    had intercourse), then you tell me that my son has died!&#148; Then he said, &#147;<i>Innaa\r\n    Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji&#146;oon<\/i> (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him\r\n    we shall return &#150; the words uttered by Muslims when faced with news of death or\r\n    calamity) and he praised Allaah. In the morning, he did ghusl (full ablution) then he went\r\n    to the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and prayed with\r\n    him, and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) said, &#147;May Allaah bless you for last night.&#148; She conceived a\r\n    child (thus the Prophet&#146;s prayer for them was answered).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Um Sulaym used to travel with the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), leaving Madeenah when he left, and returning when he\r\n    returned. The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said,\r\n    &#147;When she gives birth, bring the child to me.&#148; He was on a journey, and Um\r\n    Sulaym was with him. When the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) came back from travelling, he would never enter Madeenah at night (so as not to\r\n    disturb the people, and so that wives would have time to get ready to greet their\r\n    husbands). They reached the outskirts of Madeenah, and her labour pains started. Abu\r\n    Talhah stayed with her, and the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) went on. Abu Talhah said, &#147;O Allaah, you know that I like to set out with\r\n    your Messenger when he sets out, and come back with him when he comes back. I have been\r\n    detained as You see.&#148; Um Sulaym said, &#147;O Abu Talhah, I do not feel the pains as\r\n    much (this was one of her &#147;miracles&#148;; her labour pains ceased because she had\r\n    asked Allaah to enable her to catch up with the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him)). So they set off, and after they had reached Madeenah, her labour\r\n    pains started again, and she gave birth to a boy. She told her son Anas, &#147;O Anas, I\r\n    will not give him anything to eat until you take him in the morning to the Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),&#148; and she sent some dates with\r\n    him. (Because she wanted the first thing to enter the child&#146;s mouth to be food from\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); this was a sign of her great\r\n    faith, because the woman&#146;s natural instinct is to hasten to feed the baby as soon as\r\n    he is born). The child cried all night long, and I [Anas, the narrator of this story]\r\n    stayed up all night taking care of him. In the morning, I took him to the Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who was wearing his burdah (a kind of\r\n    cloak) and marking the camels and sheep that had been given to him (the animals had been\r\n    given in charity and he was marking them so that they would not get lost or mixed with\r\n    other flocks or herds). When he saw him, he said to Anas, &#147;Has the daughter of\r\n    Milhaan [i.e., Um Sulaym] given birth?&#148; He said, &#147;Yes.&#148; He said, &#147;I\r\n    will be with you in a minute.&#148; He put down the tool in his hand (with which he had\r\n    been marking the animals) and took the child, then he said, &#147;Do you have something\r\n    for him?&#148; They said, &#147;Yes, dates.&#148; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) took some of the dates and chewed them, mixing them with his saliva\r\n    (and the saliva of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was blessed by\r\n    Allaah). Then he opened the child&#146;s mouth and gave him some of the dates, wiping them\r\n    inside his mouth (this is called Tahneek and is one of the customs among Muslims when a\r\n    baby is born). The infant began to smack his lips, sucking some of the sweetness of the\r\n    dates and the saliva of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Thus the\r\n    first thing that entered that child&#146;s stomach was mixed with the saliva of the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said, &#147;See how\r\n    much the Ansaar (the Muslims who were living in Madeenah when the Prophet migrated there)\r\n    love dates!&#148; I [Anas] said, &#147;O Messenger of Allaah, name him.&#148; He wiped his\r\n    face and named him &#145;Abd-Allaah. There was no young man among the Ansaar who was\r\n    better than him, and when he grew up he had a lot of sons, and was martyred in Persia (he\r\n    died as a martyr when the Muslims conquered Persia; all of this happened as a result of\r\n    the Prophet&#146;s blessed du&#146;aa&#146;).<\/p>\r\n    <p>(The story was reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari, Muslim, Ahmad and\r\n    al-Tayaalisi; this version was reported by al-Tayaalisi and others.

But this applies only when it is not possible to enforce the jizyah \r\n    system, because Allaah says in Soorat al-Tawbah (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;Fight against those who \r\n    (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that \r\n    which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger&nbsp; (Muhammad), (4) and \r\n    those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the \r\n    people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah \r\n    with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued<\/span>&rdquo;\r\n    <\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    [al-Tawbah 9:29] <\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>At the \r\n    same time, we must also make sure that we are striving to support the truth. \r\n    This should not be an attempt on the part of the Muslims to appease the \r\n    mushrikeen or to give up any of the rulings of Allaah, or anything that \r\n    would entail their compromising their own dignity.

Hence it had the great effect of bringing peace and \r\n    security for everyone. Truth prevailed, he gained power in the land, people \r\n    entered the religion of Allaah in crowds, and everyone was able to strive \r\n    for his worldly and spiritual interests.&nbsp; This was a time of prosperity and \r\n    power, when Islam and peace spread. History and real life provide stronger \r\n    evidence and a more eloquent testimony to that effect, for those who are \r\n    open-minded and objective, and who are free from tribalistic and \r\n    argumentative thought.

It honours women as mothers who \r\n    must be respected, obeyed and treated with kindness. Pleasing one's mother \r\n    is regarded as part of pleasing Allaah. Islam tells us that Paradise lies at \r\n    the mother&rsquo;s feet, i.e. that the best way to reach Paradise is through one's \r\n    mother. And Islam forbids disobeying one&rsquo;s mother or making her angry, even \r\n    by saying a mild word of disrespect. The mother&rsquo;s rights are greater than \r\n    those of the father, and the duty to take care of her grows greater as the \r\n    mother grows older and weaker.

Hence for many centuries it was unheard of among the people \r\n    of Islam for a mother to be left in an old-people&rsquo;s home or for a son to \r\n    kick her out of the house, or for her sons to refuse to spend on her, or for \r\n    her to need to work in order to eat and drink if her sons were present.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam also honours women as wives. Islam urges the husband to \r\n    treat his wife in a good and kind manner, and says that the wife has rights \r\n    over the husband like his rights over her, except that he has a degree over \r\n    her, because of his responsibility of spending and taking care of the \r\n    family&rsquo;s affairs. Islam states that the best of the Muslim men is the one \r\n    who treats his wife in the best manner, and the man is forbidden to take his \r\n    wife&rsquo;s money without her consent.

Islam states that raising daughters will \r\n    bring a great reward. For example, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever takes care of two girls until they reach \r\n    adulthood, he and I will come like this on the Day of Resurrection,&rdquo; and he \r\n    held his fingers together.

Islam enjoins \r\n    upholding the ties of kinship and forbids severing those ties in many texts. \r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O \r\n    people!

So women, like men, are commanded to believe \r\n    in Allaah and to worship Him. And women are made equal to men in terms of \r\n    reward in the Hereafter. Women have the right to express themselves, to give \r\n    sincere advice, to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and to call \r\n    people to Allaah. Women have the right to own property, to buy and sell, to \r\n    inherit, to give charity and to give gifts. It is not permissible for anyone \r\n    to take a woman&rsquo;s wealth without her consent. Women have the right to a \r\n    decent life, without facing aggression or being wronged. Women have the \r\n    right to be educated; in fact it is obligatory to teach them what they need \r\n    to know about their religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Anyone who compares the rights of women in Islam with their \r\n    situation during the Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance)or in other civilizations will understand \r\n    that what we are saying is true. In fact we are certain that women are given \r\n    the greatest honour in Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no need for us to mention the situation of women in \r\n    Greek, Persian or Jewish society, but even Christian societies had a bad \r\n    attitude towards women. The theologians even gathered at the Council of \r\n    Macon to discuss whether a woman was merely a body or a body with a soul. They \r\n    thought it most likely that women did not have a soul that could be saved, \r\n    and they made an exception only in the case of Mary (Maryam &ndash; peace be upon \r\n    her).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The French held a conference in 586 CE to discuss whether \r\n    women had souls or not, and if they had souls, were these souls animal or \r\n    human? In the end, they decided that they were human! But they were created \r\n    to serve men only.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    During the time of Henry VIII, the English Parliament issued \r\n    a decree forbidding women to read the New Testament because they were \r\n    regarded as impure.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Until 1805, English law allowed a man to sell his wife, and \r\n    set a wife&rsquo;s price at six pennies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the modern age, women were kicked out of the house at the \r\n    age of eighteen so that they could start working to earn a bite to eat. If a \r\n    woman wanted to stay in the house, she had to pay her parents rent for her \r\n    room and pay for her food and laundry.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See &lsquo;<i>Awdat al-Hijaab<\/i>, 2\/47-56.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How can this compare to Islam which enjoins honouring and \r\n    kind treatment of women, and spending on them?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the changes in these rights throughout the \r\n    ages, the basic principles have not changed, but with regard to the \r\n    application of these principles, there can be no doubt that during the \r\n    golden age of Islam, the Muslims applied the sharee&rsquo;ah (Islamic law) of their Lord more, \r\n    and the rulings of this sharee&rsquo;ah include honouring one&rsquo;s mother and \r\n    treating one&rsquo;s wife, daughter, sister and women in general in a kind manner. \r\n    The weaker religious commitment grew, the more these rights were neglected, \r\n    but until the Day of Resurrection there will continue to be a group who adheres to their religion and applies the sharee&rsquo;ah (laws) of their Lord.

He should call him to Allah and explain to him the reality of Islam \r\n    when possible, with regard to whatever issues he has knowledge about, \r\n    because this is the greatest kindness that he can give to his \r\n    fellow-citizens and to those whom he meets of Jews, Christians and others \r\n    who may be mushrikeen (polytheists), because the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The one who guides others to goodness \r\n    will have a reward like that of the one who does it.&rdquo; And he (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said to &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), \r\n    when he sent him to Khaybar and instructed him to call the Jews to Islam: \r\n    &ldquo;By Allah, if Allah were to guide one man through you, that would be better \r\n    for you than having red camels (the best kind).&rdquo; And he (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever calls others to right guidance will \r\n    have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting \r\n    from their reward in the slightest.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So calling him (the non-Muslim) to Islam, conveying Islam to \r\n    him and being sincere towards him in that are among the best means of \r\n    drawing close to Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should not wrong him, with regard to his physical \r\n    wellbeing, his wealth or his honour. If he is a dhimmi (non-Muslim living \r\n    under Muslim rule), musta&rsquo;man (one who is granted security in a Muslim land) \r\n    or mu&lsquo;aahid (one with whose country the Muslims have a peace deal), then he \r\n    should give him his due rights, and not transgress against his wealth by \r\n    stealing, betraying or deceiving, and he should not harm him physically by \r\n    striking or killing him, because the fact that he is a mu&lsquo;aahid or dhimmi, \r\n    or musta&rsquo;man, means that he is protected by sharee&lsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no reason why we should not interact with him, \r\n    buying, selling, renting, hiring and so on. It is narrated in saheeh reports \r\n    that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    bought from kuffaar who were idol worshippers, and he bought from the Jews, \r\n    and these are interactions. When he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) died, his shield was being held in pledge by a Jew for some food he had \r\n    bought for his family (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to greeting, the Muslim should not initiate the \r\n    greeting, but he may return it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not initiate the greeting of salaam with the \r\n    Jews or Christians.&rdquo; And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;If the people of the Book greet you with salaam (by saying al-salaamu \r\n    &lsquo;alaykum), say &lsquo;Wa &lsquo;alaykum.&rsquo;&rdquo; So the Muslim should not initiate the \r\n    greeting to a kaafir, but if the kaafir initiates it, and the Jew or \r\n    Christians etc. greets you with salaam, then you should say &ldquo;wa &lsquo;alaykum,&rdquo; \r\n    as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are some of the rights between a Muslim and a kaafir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another right is being a good neighbour. So if he is a \r\n    neighbour, be kind to him and do not annoy him; give charity to him if he is \r\n    poor, give him gifts, give him beneficial advice, because these are things \r\n    that will attract him to Islam and to become Muslim; and because the \r\n    neighbour has rights. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Jibreel kept urging me to be kind to my neighbour until I \r\n    thought that he would make him my heir.&rdquo; Saheeh - agreed upon. If the \r\n    neighbour is a kaafir, he still has the rights of a neighbour; if he is both \r\n    a relative and a kaafir, then he has two rights: the rights of a neighbour \r\n    and the rights of a relative.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the rights of the neighbour is that you should give \r\n    him charity, but not zakaah, if he is poor, because Allah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Allaah does not forbid you to deal \r\n    justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of \r\n    religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who \r\n    deal with equity&rdquo; [al-Mumtahanah 60:8]<\/i>. According to the saheeh hadeeth \r\n    narrated from Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her), her \r\n    mother, who was a mushrik, entered upon her during the truce between the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the people of Makkah, \r\n    seeking help. Asma&rsquo; asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) for permission - should she uphold ties of kinship with her? The \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Uphold ties of \r\n    kinship with her.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But with regard to celebrating their festivals, the Muslim \r\n    should not take part in celebrating their festivals, but there is nothing \r\n    wrong with offering them condolences if a loved one dies, such as saying \r\n    &ldquo;May Allah compensate you in your loss&rdquo; and other kind words. But he should \r\n    not say &ldquo;May Allah forgive him&rdquo; or &ldquo;May Allah have mercy on him&rdquo; if the \r\n    deceased was a kaafir, and he should not pray for the deceased if he was a \r\n    kaafir. But he may pray for the one who is alive to be guided and to be \r\n    compensated and so on.

The \r\n    Messiah Jesus son of Mary is no more than a Messenger from Him, who came to \r\n    the Children of Israel with glad tidings and warnings, and Allah made him a \r\n    sign for the people as his mother bore him without a husband, but this sign \r\n    does not make him a son of God, may He be exalted. Adam (peace be upon him) \r\n    did not have a father or a mother, according to the consensus of all \r\n    religions, so if merely being born without a father means that it may be \r\n    said that the Messiah was the son of God, then Adam (peace be upon him) is \r\n    more entitled to that. And the creation of Eve (peace be upon her) was \r\n    greater than the creation of Jesus son of Mary, but no wise person would say \r\n    that she is the daughter of God.

It did not exist at the \r\n    time of the Apostles. &hellip; Moreover, it was never mentioned until a later stage \r\n    in the development of Christian teachings and Christ never spoke of it when \r\n    he was preaching and teaching after he rose from the dead.

Hence historians regard it as more likely that the Trinitarian \r\n    baptismal formula was a brief summary for preparing for baptism.

If they had \r\n    heard Christ instructing them to call the nations in the name of the Father, \r\n    Son and Holy Spirit, they would have gone out in obedience to his words, \r\n    without any objection, to tell the nations of his message.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(d)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>When Peter was \r\n    summoned by the pagan Cornelius to find out about Christianity from him, \r\n    then he became Christian at Peter&rsquo;s hands, the other disciples objected to \r\n    that, but he said to them: &ldquo;He said to them: &lsquo;You are well aware that it is \r\n    against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God \r\n    has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean&rsquo;&rdquo; (Acts \r\n    10:28). But he did not say that Christ had instructed them to do that; \r\n    rather he said: &ldquo;&hellip; us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the \r\n    dead. <sup>42<\/sup>He commanded us to preach to the people&rdquo; (Acts 10:41-42), \r\n    i.e., to the Jews only. When he went back to <\/span>\r\n    <span>Jerusalem<\/span><span>, \r\n    he was faced with more criticism, &ldquo;the circumcised believers criticized him\r\n    <sup>3<\/sup>and said, &lsquo;You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate \r\n    with them!&rsquo;&rdquo; (Acts 11:2-3). Then Peter began to tell them of a dream he had \r\n    seen that justified his eating with the Gentiles (Acts 11:4-10). And he told \r\n    them how the Holy Spirit had come to him and told him to go: &ldquo;the Spirit \r\n    told me to have no hesitation about going with them and he also went with \r\n    me&rdquo; (Acts 11:12).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>After this \r\n    detailed and convincing argument from Peter, the disciples approved of his \r\n    going to the uncircumcised. &ldquo;When they heard this, they had no further \r\n    objections and praised God, saying, &lsquo;So then, God has granted even the \r\n    Gentiles repentance unto life&rsquo;&rdquo; (Acts 11:18).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Based on that, \r\n    all these people, including Peter, knew nothing about the text of Matthew \r\n    which enjoins baptizing all nations in the name of the Father, Son and Holy \r\n    Spirit. Why is that? Because Christ did not say it and they did not hear it. \r\n    If Christ had said it, there would not have been any need for blame and \r\n    rebuke. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>7.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Moreover, the \r\n    Disciples agreed with Paul that he would call the Gentiles while they would \r\n    call the circumcised, i.e. the Jews. Paul says: <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;On the \r\n    contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the \r\n    gospel to the Gentiles [lit. the uncircumcised], just as Peter had been to \r\n    the Jews [lit. the circumcised]. <sup>8<\/sup>For God, who was at work in the \r\n    ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry \r\n    as an apostle to the Gentiles. <sup>9<\/sup>James, Peter<sup>[c]<\/sup> \r\n    and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand \r\n    of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that \r\n    we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Galatians \r\n    2:7-9.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>So how could \r\n    they go against the commandment of Christ -- if the text in Matthew is true \r\n    -- and refrain from calling the nations, then leave that to Paul and \r\n    Barnabas only?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>All these \r\n    facts prove the text in Matthew to be false and confirm that it is a \r\n    fabricated text that cannot be soundly attributed to Christ. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Regardless of \r\n    all that, there is nothing in the text to indicate that it is talking about \r\n    three holy ones united in one being. Rather it is talking about three \r\n    different essences mentioned together in conjunction, which indicates that \r\n    they are different, distinct essences. The correct meaning of this passage \r\n    at the end of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel is: Go in the name of God and His Messenger \r\n    Jesus and the Revelation sent down to him with the teachings of God. The \r\n    wording mentioned in Matthew is similar to another phrase which the \r\n    Christians do not interpret it as referring to trinity. In Paul&rsquo;s first \r\n    Epistle to Timothy it says:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;I charge you, \r\n    in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels &hellip;&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>I Timothy \r\n    5:21&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>No one \r\n    understood this text as being indicative of the divinity of the angels, or \r\n    suggesting that they are the third &ldquo;person&rdquo; [of the trinity]. . The same may \r\n    be said about the text in Matthew as about the text of Paul.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Similar to \r\n    that is the text in Exodus which calls upon the Children of Israel to \r\n    believe in God and in Moses, without any notion that the two who are \r\n    mentioned together are equal:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;&hellip;the people \r\n    feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Exodus 14:31&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This style of \r\n    expression is known in many languages and in many books. Something similar \r\n    is mentioned in the Qur&rsquo;aan:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;O you who \r\n    believe! Believe in Allaah, and His Messenger (Muhammad\r\n    <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>), and the Book (the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He \r\n    sent down to those before (him) &hellip;&rdquo;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-Nisa&rsquo; \r\n    4:136]<\/span><\/i><span>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>However, we \r\n    should draw your attention, O seeker of the truth, to the fact that even if \r\n    we assume that these words were not an addition to the Gospel of Matthew, \r\n    and that this is how they were narrated, that does not mean that Christ is \r\n    the son of God, as the Christians say (exalted be God far above that). The \r\n    same wording is used to refer to people other than Christ in many other \r\n    contexts, but no one of your religion says that this means they are sons of \r\n    God in a real, literal sense. Think about these words in the Gospel of \r\n    Matthew:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;Blessed are \r\n    the pure in heart,<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they \r\n    will see God.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&nbsp;<sup>9<\/sup>Blessed \r\n    are the peacemakers,<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they \r\n    will be called sons of God&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>[Matthew \r\n    5:8-9].&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Are the \r\n    peacemakers, based on what is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, sons of \r\n    God, as the same Gospel calls Jesus the son of God?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>See also the \r\n    answer to question no. 82361.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>You can read \r\n    more of what Christian scholars and bishops have said, most of which is \r\n    verified with pictures of the books mentioned, by following this link:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <h3>\r\n    <span>\r\n    <a>\r\n    <span>\r\n    http:\/\/www.aljame3.net\/ib?showtopic=6105&amp;mode=threaded&amp;pid=35588<\/span><\/a><\/span><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span>\r\n    <span>W. \r\n    Petersen<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span>\r\n    <span>\r\n    Anchor Bible Dictionary<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span>\r\n    <span>Beck \r\n    Dictionary<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span><span><i>\r\n    <span>History of \r\n    Dogma<\/span><\/i><\/span><span> \r\n    [Adolf Harnack]<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span><span><i>\r\n    <span>For Christ&rsquo;s \r\n    Sake<\/span><\/i><\/span><span>, \r\n    Tom Harpur<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span><span><i>\r\n    <span>Encyclopaedia \r\n    Britannica<\/span><\/i><\/span><span>, \r\n    1911 edition<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span><\/i><span><i>\r\n    <span>Schaff-Herzog \r\n    Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge<\/span><\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span><\/i><span><i>\r\n    <span>The Catholic \r\n    Encyclopaedia<\/span><\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><\/span><span><i>\r\n    <span>New Testament \r\n    Studies<\/span><\/i><\/span><span>, \r\n    American Catholic University, Washington, 1923 CE.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Finally:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>We ask God to \r\n    open your heart to the truth and decree good for you, and to guide you to \r\n    that which He loves and which pleases Him of beliefs, words and actions.

Is the happiness that you said you were living with really \r\n    true happiness? Is your view of Islam correct? The time has now come for you \r\n    to use your reason and ask yourself: How could Christ (&ldquo;God&rdquo;!) be in the \r\n    womb of a created woman? Is the mother of this &ldquo;God&rdquo; (!) -- the Virgin Mary \r\n    -- a creator or a created being? Who was crucified on the cross in the light \r\n    of this belief that the divine was not separated from the human; was the \r\n    divine crucified with him or did it leave him at the time of the \r\n    crucifixion? Was the Lord God unable to find a way to forgive the sins of \r\n    mankind except this repugnant way in which His only son was killed?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Does God want to show mercy to mankind and for that reason He \r\n    punished His son?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The time has come to think about the idolatrous ideas that \r\n    Paul introduced to this religion, as he introduced the idea that Christ was \r\n    created from the divine, after the Christians had been unanimously agreed \r\n    that he was a created being, a slave or servant of God. Who is Christ \r\n    according to the Christians? Is he the Lord or the son of the Lord or the \r\n    third of three? The time has come to think about the belief in Trinity which \r\n    is contrary to sound human nature and common sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The time has come to think about the contradictions in the \r\n    attitude towards the cross; instead of burning every cross and treating it \r\n    in a disrespectful manner because it was on something like this that the \r\n    Lord or the son of the Lord was crucified -- God forbid -- as the Christians \r\n    claim, we see them venerating it and regarding it as holy and worshipping \r\n    it. The time has come to think about the embarrassing differences between \r\n    the Gospels, from which there is no way out except to admit that they have \r\n    been tampered with and the wording and meaning has been distorted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Read with us the story of a former preacher who is now a \r\n    Muslim, Yusuf Estes; if this how he was when he was a preacher in the \r\n    churches, then how about the ordinary masses of Christians? Yusuf Estes \r\n    says, telling the story of how he came to Islam:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There were things in the Bible that I did not believe, \r\n    because I could see many contradictions in it. One of these things that I \r\n    asked myself and others about was: how can God be one and three at the same \r\n    time? I asked world-famous preachers about that and they gave a very foolish \r\n    answer that no rational person could believe. I said to them: How can I be a \r\n    preacher of Christianity and teach people that God is one person and three \r\n    persons at the same time, when I am not convinced of that? How can I \r\n    convince others of it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of them said to me: Do not discuss this idea or explain \r\n    it. Tell the people that this is a mystery that we have to believe in. Some \r\n    of them said to me: You can explain it as being like an apple that contains \r\n    a skin on the outside and flesh on the inside and the seed inside. I said to \r\n    them: This cannot be given as an example of God. An apple contains more than \r\n    one seed, so that would mean that there are a number of gods; and there may \r\n    be worms in it, so there would be a number of gods. It may be rotten and I \r\n    do not want a rotten god.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of them said: It is like an egg which contains the \r\n    shell, the yolk and the white. I said: This cannot be the likeness of God, \r\n    because the egg may contain more than one yolk, so that would mean there are \r\n    a number of gods; or it may be rotten, and I do not want to worship a rotten \r\n    god.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of them said: It is like a man and a woman and their \r\n    son. I said to them: The woman may get pregnant again and that would mean \r\n    there are a number of gods. They may get divorced, so this divinity would be \r\n    split. One of them may die. And I do not want a god who is like that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Since the time I became a Christian and a preacher of \r\n    Christianity I could not convince myself about the issue of the Trinity and \r\n    I did not find anyone who could convince a rational person of it. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He and his wife and his father became Muslim, by the grace of \r\n    Allah, and he has not seen any contradiction in Islam or any shirk \r\n    (polytheism or association of others with Allah). He has never seen any \r\n    different version of the Qur&rsquo;aan among the Muslims at all. This is the \r\n    reason why he and his family became Muslim, and thus Allah saved him from \r\n    disbelief and punishment and admitted them to the paradise of this world, \r\n    and we hope that they will all enter the Paradise of the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These issues that we have mentioned to you -- and many others \r\n    -- have been reasons why thousands of followers of Christianity have begun \r\n    to think, and Allah has guided many rational people who were enabled to \r\n    ponder, and they found that what they were following was not the religion \r\n    that claimed the oneness of the Creator and directed worship to Him alone \r\n    with no partner or associate, and declared him to be above having any wife, \r\n    son or partner. They found that Islam is the true religion which proclaims \r\n    the oneness of God and venerates Him alone as He should be venerated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From your letter we learned of the grief that you felt when \r\n    your father died, and the grief that followed it because of the attitude of \r\n    your former friends. But that is in the past and today is a new day, so turn \r\n    these sorrows -- which are justifiable -- into joy and happiness which you \r\n    can bring into your life by thinking about what we have said to you. We are \r\n    certain that your situation is going to be like that of millions who came \r\n    before you, who lives have been changed just by their uttering the twin \r\n    declaration of faith (al-shahaadatayn). Straightaway you will feel true \r\n    happiness and it will become clear to you that you never tasted happiness at \r\n    all before this moment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    At that time we will be very happy for you and your new, true \r\n    faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Who told you that there is no place for you in Islam? Who \r\n    said that the fact that you are American will affect your position and \r\n    standing among the Muslims? Rather if you enter Islam, you will be held in \r\n    high esteem by the Muslims and you will be a sister to millions of Muslim \r\n    women throughout the world. You will be welcomed and respected by every \r\n    Muslim, because by becoming Muslim you will become a sister in faith to all \r\n    Muslims. This does not mean that you are going to mix with angelic people, \r\n    for we are all human and we all make mistakes and have faults. But whatever \r\n    good there is in others, we have it many times over, and whatever evils we \r\n    have, others have it many times over. The enemies of Allah have succeeded in \r\n    distorting the image of Islam and Muslims, yet despite that Islam still has \r\n    things that distinguish it from all other religions and the Muslims have \r\n    something that distinguishes them from all other people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that you have a daughter from a Christian husband \r\n    does not mean that you cannot be accepted as a Muslim woman. Rather by \r\n    entering Islam you will be saving yourself and your daughter. The marriage \r\n    contract that existed between you and your husband will be acknowledged by \r\n    Islam and its results (i.e., your daughter) will be accepted. Many people \r\n    have entered Islam and Islam did not require them to change their marriage \r\n    contracts or say that their children will no longer part of the family, if \r\n    their marriage contracts were done before they were Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not correct to say that you will spoil the religious \r\n    commitment of a Muslim man if you get married. Islam allows a Muslim man to \r\n    marry a Christian woman in the first place, and it is better for her because \r\n    she may enter Islam because of that. If she becomes a Muslim, that is better \r\n    for the husband because he will now have someone to help him in his \r\n    religious commitment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A Muslim cannot marry a Christian woman when she is still \r\n    married to her husband, even if that husband is a Christian or a Jew, until \r\n    they have become divorced and her &lsquo;iddah [waiting period following divorce] \r\n    has ended.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the wife becomes Muslim and her husband is not a \r\n    Muslim, then she has to keep away from him and not let him be intimate with \r\n    her, and she should wait until the end of her &lsquo;iddah, which is three \r\n    menstrual cycles. If her husband becomes Muslim during this period, then she \r\n    is still his wife as she was before. But if he persists in following \r\n    something other than Islam, then the relationship between them is over and \r\n    she may now marry whoever she wants. If she has a Muslim wali (guardian), he \r\n    may perform her marriage, otherwise the Muslim judge (qaadi), or someone who \r\n    takes his place, may perform her marriage.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, we ask Allah to guide you to Islam and to show you \r\n    the truth as truth and enable you to follow it, and to show you falsehood as \r\n    false and enable you to avoid it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We are looking forward to receiving a message from you \r\n    telling us that you have become Muslim and that Allah has brought joy to \r\n    your heart by bringing you into the fold of Islam. Then we hope that by \r\n    publishing your story, it will be a cause of many women coming to Islam, and \r\n    that you will have a reward equal to theirs with Allah on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please also see the answer the questions nos.\r\n    [fatin]101572[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]3313[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11180","question_id":"11180","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this daughter of yours was Muslim from birth and you are \r\n    both Muslims, and she is the one who has apostatised from her religion, then \r\n    the apostate has no sanctity in Islam. Rather he should be asked to repent \r\n    from his apostasy. If he repents, all well and good. But if he does not \r\n    repent, then the ruling according to sharee&lsquo;ah is that he is to be executed, \r\n    if there is an Islamic state that can do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the situation is as we see, that there is no Islamic \r\n    state that carries out the hadd punishment for apostasy on the apostate, \r\n    then at least we should shun him, express our dislike of him and disavow him \r\n    until he comes back to his religion. If he comes back, all well and good, \r\n    otherwise he has no sanctity and has no right for ties with him to be upheld \r\n    or good treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is reinforced if your husband tells you to do it; you do \r\n    not have the right to go against him in this regard.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ahmad said: &hellip; If there is someone who becomes a disbeliever \r\n    or commits evil by practising innovation or calls people to misleading \r\n    innovation or an evil innovation, the one who is unable to argue with him \r\n    and prove his mistake, or is afraid that he may be influenced by him or be \r\n    harmed by him has to shun him. And there is another view, which is that he \r\n    should be shunned by all, and this is the apparent meaning of the words of \r\n    Imam Ahmad quoted above. Ibn &lsquo;Aqeel stated that this (the latter view) is \r\n    the correct view in his book <i>al-Mu&lsquo;taqad<\/i>. He said: So that (shunning \r\n    him) will bring him back to his senses and make him recant and come back to \r\n    Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said: If you want to find out the extent of people&rsquo;s \r\n    commitment to Islam nowadays, do not look at the crowds around the doors of \r\n    the Jaami&lsquo; mosques or the noise they make in &lsquo;Arafah when they start to \r\n    shout &ldquo;Labbayk&rdquo;; rather look at how easy-going they are with the enemies of \r\n    Islam. For example, Ibn al-Raawandi and al-Ma&lsquo;arri, may Allah curse them, \r\n    lived for many years writing prose and poetry (that contained heresy) and \r\n    now their graves are built up (as a sign of respect) and their books are \r\n    widely circulated and this is an indication of the weakness of religious \r\n    commitment of people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A similar fatwa was issued by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Adaab al-Shara&lsquo;iyyah<\/i>, 1\/255&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you and her father were originally not Muslim and you \r\n    used to follow the religion that she follows, then Allah guided you to His \r\n    religion but she continued to follow her religion, i.e., she was originally \r\n    a disbeliever and is not an apostate, then there is nothing wrong with you \r\n    upholding ties with her and talking to her, and you should come to an \r\n    understanding with your husband concerning that. Perhaps Allah will guide \r\n    her at your hands and open her heart to Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari narrated in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> (5981) that Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &lsquo;Umar saw a suit of striped silk \r\n    being offered for sale and he said: O Messenger of Allah, why don&rsquo;t you buy \r\n    this and wear it on the day of Jumu&lsquo;ah and when delegations come to you? He \r\n    said: &ldquo;This is only worn by one who has no share (of reward, in the \r\n    Hereafter).&rdquo; Some suits of it (that fabric) were brought to the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he sent a suit to &lsquo;Umar, who \r\n    said: How can I wear it when you said about it what you said?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said: &ldquo;I did not give it to you for you to wear it; rather \r\n    sell it or give it to someone else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So &lsquo;Umar sent it to a brother of his in Makkah before he \r\n    became Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) included this \r\n    report in a chapter in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> entitled <i>Baab Silat al-Akh \r\n    al-Mushrik<\/i> (Chapter on upholding ties with a polytheist brother).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated \r\n    that one of the scholars said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shunning is of two types: shunning in the heart and shunning \r\n    verbally. Shunning the kaafir is done in the heart, not loving him or \r\n    cooperating with him or supporting him, especially if he is in a state of \r\n    war against the Muslims. It is not prescribed to shun him verbally because \r\n    that will not deter him from his kufr, unlike the sinful Muslim who would \r\n    usually be deterred by that. It is prescribed to talk to both the kaafir and \r\n    the sinful Muslim by calling them to obey Allah, and they are to be enjoined \r\n    to do good and forbidden to do evil. Rather what is prescribed is not to \r\n    speak to them in a friendly manner and the like.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 9\/497.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11181","question_id":"11181","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The greatest blessing that Allah can bestow upon His slave is \r\n    to enable him to discover Islam and open his heart to believe in Him and to \r\n    submit to Him.

In his constriction it is as if he is climbing up to the sky, \r\n    i.e., as if he has been made to climb up to the sky, which he is reluctant \r\n    to do. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This reason, the fact that they do not believe, is what \r\n    dictated that Allah should put the wrath on them, because they closed the \r\n    door of mercy and goodness for themselves. This is a rule that does not \r\n    change. The one who gives (in charity) and fears Allah and testifies to the \r\n    truth, Allah will show him the path of ease, but whoever is miserly and \r\n    thinks he does not need any guidance and disbelieves in the truth, Allah \r\n    will show him the path of evil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Tafseer al-Sa&lsquo;di<\/i>, 272.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allah to guide you and open your heart to Islam, and \r\n    to bless you by enabling you to submit to Him and accept His religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your entering Islam is something that is obligatory and there \r\n    can be no delay or hesitation, because it is the way to eternal happiness \r\n    and salvation from disbelief and eternity in Hellfire. So there is no room \r\n    for choice in that regard, and you should not place any obstacle in the way, \r\n    no matter what it is. Rather you should hasten to enter Islam straight away, \r\n    and throw off the life of heedlessness and confusion. When you do ghusl \r\n    (full ablution) and pray and prostrate before Allah, you will realise the \r\n    difference between being a person who is a slave to Allah the Almighty \r\n    Creator, and being a person who is a slave to his own self and his whims and \r\n    desires.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps you think now that you will never overcome the haraam \r\n    deed that is tattooing, but we believe that when you become Muslim, you will \r\n    gain an amazing strength by which you will attain victory over your nafs \r\n    (self) and you will find your freedom and pleasure in obeying the command of \r\n    your Lord and sacrificing worldly gains and pleasures to please Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Entering into the new religion means that one is breaking \r\n    free from constraint, constriction, humiliation and a life of hardship. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is freeing one&rsquo;s soul to soar in a vast world which can \r\n    hardly encompass his joy and happiness, and one will be prepared to \r\n    sacrifice what is dear and precious in order to retain this happiness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Life is filled with dozens and hundreds of stories and cases \r\n    in which people -- after becoming Muslim -- were able to overcome habits and \r\n    attitudes that had been deeply rooted in their lives, such as zina \r\n    (fornication, adultery) and drinking alcohol; giving up such things is much \r\n    harder than giving up a job or profession.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam instils in the hearts of its followers the certainty \r\n    that Allah is the Sovereign, the Provider Who provides for His slave from sources they could not imagine, and He does not disappoint anyone who puts his hope in Him.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He \r\n    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>3.&nbsp;And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \r\n    imagine.

During those days \r\n    there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he left them there \r\n    and left with them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small \r\n    water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ismaa&rsquo;eel&rsquo;s mother \r\n    followed him saying, &ldquo;O Ibraaheem! Where are you going, leaving us in this \r\n    valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there \r\n    anything (to enjoy)?&rdquo; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not \r\n    look at her. Then she asked him, &ldquo;Has Allaah commanded you to do this?&rdquo; He \r\n    said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Then He will not forsake us,&rdquo; and went back while \r\n    Abraham proceeded onwards. When he reached al-Thaniyah where they could not \r\n    see him, he turned to face the Ka&rsquo;bah, and raising both hands, invoked Allah \r\n    saying the following prayer: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in \r\n    an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka&lsquo;bah at Makkah) in order, \r\n    O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah). So fill \r\n    some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them \r\n    with fruits so that they may give thanks&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Ibraaheem 14:37].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ismaa&rsquo;eel&rsquo;s mother went on breastfeeding Ismaa&rsquo;eel and \r\n    drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all \r\n    been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She \r\n    started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa&rsquo;eel) tossing in agony. She left him, for \r\n    she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa \r\n    was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started \r\n    looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could \r\n    not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the \r\n    valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in \r\n    distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwa where \r\n    she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not \r\n    see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa and al-Marwa) seven \r\n    times. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said, &ldquo;This is the (origin of) the people&rsquo;s saa&rsquo;i (walking) \r\n    between them between them (i.e. al-Safa and al-Marwa).&rdquo; When she reached al-Marwa \r\n    (for the last time) she heard a voice and she said to herself &ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; and \r\n    listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &ldquo;O, (whoever you \r\n    may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help \r\n    me?&rdquo; Then she saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with \r\n    his heel (or his wing), until water appeared. She started to make something \r\n    like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her \r\n    water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after \r\n    she had scooped some of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said, &ldquo;May Allah have mercy on the mother of Ismaa&rsquo;eel! Had she \r\n    let Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from \r\n    that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream \r\n    flowing on the surface of the earth.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;The angel said to her, \r\n    &lsquo;Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which \r\n    will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His \r\n    people&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The story was narrated at length in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i>, \r\n    3364.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See how the mother of Ismaa&lsquo;eel (peace be upon him) had \r\n    certain faith that Allah would not forsake them so long as Ibraaheem did \r\n    what Allah commanded him to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Look at the angel who came to her to bring forth water for \r\n    her and her thirsty child from the depths of the earth; He said to her: Do \r\n    not be afraid of being neglected &hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So do not be afraid of being neglected, for Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, is too generous and kind for that and He is greater \r\n    than you can ever imagine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This does not apply only to you; rather this is something \r\n    that is repeated with thousands of Muslim people... They are afraid to \r\n    repent and follow the path of righteousness because they are working in \r\n    haraam jobs, in banks that deal in riba (usury), or in casinos, or in haraam \r\n    types of entertainment, and so on. The Shaytaan makes them fear poverty and \r\n    makes them think that there is no alternative way of earning a living, as \r\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Shait&acirc;n (Satan) threatens \r\n    you with poverty and orders you to commit Fahsh&acirc; (evil deeds, illegal sexual \r\n    intercourse, sins); whereas All&acirc;h promises you Forgiveness from Himself and \r\n    Bounty, and All&acirc;h is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Baqarah 2:268]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But reality demonstrates that most of those who repent find \r\n    that opportunities to earn a halaal income open up for them that they could \r\n    never imagine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we say: hasten to become Muslim and free yourself from \r\n    the shackles of disbelief; remove its darkness from your eyes and save \r\n    yourself from the Fire. Do not fear poverty when you are under the \r\n    protection of the Lord of the Worlds, the Sovereign Whose stores are never \r\n    empty. And be certain that He will never forsake His slaves or abandon His \r\n    people and close friends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Let us assume, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that you do not find any \r\n    halaal means of earning a living after you become Muslim, so you go back to \r\n    your haraam job. What comparison can there be between your situation before \r\n    and your situation after? It is a comparison between a believing Muslim who \r\n    affirms the oneness of Allah but commits sin, and a person who disbelieves \r\n    in Allah. There is no comparison between them at all. The wise man, if he \r\n    chooses between two bad things or two evils, will choose the lesser of the \r\n    two. So he will not choose a combination of disbelief and sin; rather he \r\n    will choose Islam and guidance, and if he falls into sin after he \r\n    disciplines himself in obedience to Allah, then in that case he will have \r\n    the hope of forgiveness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    However we say that this is only an assumption; we think that \r\n    Allah will honour you, provide for you and bestow upon you from His bounty \r\n    that which you cannot imagine, because He is the Most Generous, the Kind, \r\n    the Most Merciful Who says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, \r\n    while he (or she) is a true believer (of Isl&acirc;mic Monotheism) verily, to him \r\n    We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful \r\n    provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the \r\n    best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nahl 16:97]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, the best news you can give us is the news that you \r\n    have become Muslim and a believer, and we are waiting for this wonderful \r\n    news.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    O Allah, open his heart to faith and guide his heart to \r\n    Islam, and bestow upon him the bounty of Your mercy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11182","question_id":"11182","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah created men and women and created in each of them \r\n    attraction towards the other as part of their nature, which no one can deny. \r\n    Islam pays attention to that and regulates the relationship between the two, \r\n    which is restricted to marriage; Islam forbids any other kind of \r\n    relationship which is unacceptable to sound human nature and proper \r\n    thinking. Woman is not a cheap product for anyone who wants to have his way \r\n    with her; rather she is respected and should be for one man to take care of \r\n    her, spend on her and give her her rights. The way to take a woman as a wife \r\n    is by seeing her first, then asking her guardian for her hand, then giving \r\n    some wealth to be a dowry for her. All of that means that Islam regards \r\n    woman as a respectable being, not something that is easily obtained, so that \r\n    she will not be treated carelessly and looked down upon. What we see in the \r\n    world of promiscuity is that a man tries to get a woman he likes in order to \r\n    have his way with her, then he throws her aside so that he can look for \r\n    another who is more beautiful than her, and so on; and he moves from one \r\n    prey to another, one girlfriend to another. Thus no family is formed and no \r\n    children are born; as a result no family is formed on a basis of peace and \r\n    tranquillity. All of that is rejected in Islam which forbids it in a way \r\n    that leaves no room for differences of opinion. Every Muslim who goes \r\n    against that is following his whims and desires and is imitating deviant and \r\n    immoral people. Islam disavows his conduct and actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, relationships that occur between men and women \r\n    outside the framework of legitimate, documented marriage are haraam \r\n    (forbidden) relationships which it is not permissible for a Muslim to form \r\n    with any woman, whether she is Muslim or non-Muslim. We admire your telling \r\n    this Muslim man who is going against his religion that if he is looking for \r\n    sex he should look somewhere else. This confirms what we have said, that \r\n    woman is not a cheap product. But we do not approve of your going out with \r\n    him and what happened between you of being alone together and kissing. If \r\n    you think that this is something normal in your view, that is not the case \r\n    for us. What he has done are things that are forbidden in Islam and it is \r\n    not appropriate for a Muslim to do them. If you like each other, then the \r\n    only way for meetings between you to be permissible is marriage and nothing \r\n    else. Any meeting or relationship with a woman who is not related to the man \r\n    that occurs outside the framework of marriage is haraam (forbidden) and is \r\n    deserving of punishment in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See, for example, the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]34841[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should note that Islam permits marriage to a Christian \r\n    woman on condition that she should be a believer in her religion and she \r\n    should not be an atheist or a person with no religion, and on condition that \r\n    she should be chaste and honourable, not a fornicator or a woman who has \r\n    boyfriends. In order for the marriage contract to be valid, you should have \r\n    a guardian who will give your hand in marriage and there should be two \r\n    Muslim witnesses to the marriage contract; announcement of the marriage may \r\n    take the place of witnesses. For more details on this, please see the answer \r\n    to questions no. [fatin]2527[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]12283[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that a woman has children from a previous marriage \r\n    does not affect her marriage to a Muslim. If someone says that it is not \r\n    permissible for a Christian or Jewish woman to marry a Muslim unless she is \r\n    a virgin, that view is not correct. Rather the condition for her being \r\n    permissible (as a wife for a Muslim man) is that she should be chaste and \r\n    avoid fornication. This condition also applies to Muslim women; it is not \r\n    permissible for a chaste Muslim man to marry a woman who commits fornication \r\n    unless she repents sincerely. And it is not permissible for a chaste woman \r\n    to marry a man who commits fornication unless he repents sincerely, as we \r\n    have explained in the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]85335[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As the relationship between you has not gone as far as \r\n    fornication or adultery as you say, praise be to Allah, then there is no \r\n    reason why he should not marry you, as we have explained in the answer to \r\n    question no. [fatin]148528[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the Muslim man&rsquo;s family, they may accept their \r\n    son marrying a Christian woman who has children. If they refuse, that is not \r\n    because it is something that is forbidden in Islam; rather it may be for \r\n    cultural reasons, or perhaps because they think that their son is not able \r\n    to fulfil the rights of that wife and take care of her children. But they \r\n    cannot accept their son having a girlfriend with whom he spends time alone \r\n    or travels with her; if they accept that, then they are undoubtedly going \r\n    against Islamic teachings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The issue of whether or not his family will accept that is a \r\n    social issue, not a religious ruling. It is not one of the conditions of a \r\n    man&rsquo;s marriage that his family should accept it, although that is something \r\n    that is desirable.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even though the man is Muslim &ndash; as you say &ndash; that does not \r\n    prevent us from speaking the truth with regard to what he has done with you \r\n    and the ruling on his relationship with you. We would give you some further \r\n    advice: do not pay any attention to the sweet talk from anyone who has a \r\n    relationship with you outside the framework of marriage. That includes this \r\n    man&rsquo;s saying that he has become &ldquo;a captive love&rdquo; to you and that he &ldquo;will \r\n    never exploit&rdquo; you, and other such enchanting words. All of that is most \r\n    likely aimed at getting what he wants, which is to have his way with you, \r\n    then he will go off and look for someone else. What we are saying is only \r\n    based on understanding the reality of illicit relationships, especially \r\n    those that begin in chat rooms and on Facebook. We hope that you will not be \r\n    deceived by this sweet talk. If this man is sincere in his love for you, \r\n    then let him prove it by marrying you. As for proving that by going out \r\n    together to watch a movie or to a restaurant, none of that is proof of \r\n    sincerity of feelings, so do not pin your hopes on it. Even if non-Muslims \r\n    do that and women accept it, Islam forbids it and does not approve it, and \r\n    it warns women against being fooled by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now the opportunity presents itself for us to tell you of \r\n    something that will be better for you in this world and in the Hereafter, \r\n    which is to enter Islam and become a Muslim woman who affirms the Oneness of \r\n    Allah, the Creator of the universe and the Provider of all creation. This \r\n    religion to which we are calling you is the religion of Jesus (peace be upon \r\n    him) and the religion of Abraham and their fellow Prophets and Messengers, \r\n    all of whom worshipped One Lord, namely Allah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted. They devoted their worship to Him alone, with no partner or \r\n    associate, and they called the people to do likewise. Islam is the religion \r\n    that brought rulings which are suited to all times and all places; it \r\n    addresses the interests of individuals and societies. You will feel great \r\n    happiness, as has been experienced by those who have gone ahead of you on \r\n    this path. After that, Allah will make it easy for you to find a suitable \r\n    husband who will take care of you, give you your rights and seek reward with \r\n    Allah by taking care of your children, and perhaps you and he will attain \r\n    the reward of their becoming Muslim and you will be together with them in \r\n    this world and the Hereafter. If you do not become Muslim, then you must \r\n    understand that even if you are together with a Muslim man as his wife in \r\n    this world, in the Hereafter you will inevitably be separated from him. This \r\n    underlines what we have said, that your becoming Muslim means attaining \r\n    success in this world and in the Hereafter. Being together with your husband \r\n    and children in the Paradise of eternity is a great success for which wise \r\n    people strive and those who are doomed miss out on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allah to guide you to that which is best for you in \r\n    this world and in the Hereafter, and to make it easy for you to find a \r\n    righteous and good husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11183","question_id":"11183","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We appreciate your keenness to convey the message of Islam to \r\n    people, and your keenness to implement the Sunnah and not go against \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah.

The more correct \r\n    scholarly view is that it is only obligatory in a mosque in which the call \r\n    for prayer is given.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]38881[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But there may be some cases in which shar&lsquo;i needs or \r\n    important interests make it permissible for a group of Muslims to offer \r\n    prayer in congregation somewhere other than in the mosque.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no doubt that calling non-Muslims to Islam is an \r\n    important aim. If you think it most likely that your praying in the lecture \r\n    hall will have an impact on them, and may be the cause of some of them \r\n    becoming Muslim, then there is nothing wrong with praying in the lecture \r\n    hall. So you can give the adhaan and iqaamah, and pray in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If that is done every year, it is not bid&lsquo;ah (an innovation), \r\n    because the aim behind it is a legitimate shar&lsquo;i aim, namely openly \r\n    practising the rituals of Islam and calling non-Muslims to the faith. But \r\n    you should not set a specific date for that every year or every month and so \r\n    on; rather that should be done according to need. Then you can do it on \r\n    different days and choose the best day to get the largest congregation and \r\n    so that the largest possible number of non-Muslims can watch.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11184","question_id":"11184","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We welcome you to our website and we ask Allah to help us to \r\n    present useful information to you, and that this will be beneficial to you \r\n    in both spiritual and worldly terms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you are speaking about the Judaism that was prescribed by \r\n    God and the Torah that God revealed, then Islam and Judaism are agreed &ndash; as \r\n    you said &ndash; on the worship of God alone, with no partner or associate, and on \r\n    the prohibition of worshipping anything or anyone else, no matter what it \r\n    is. Similarly, they are agreed on matters of belief in the Prophets and \r\n    Messengers, the Last Day, the Reckoning, Paradise, Hell&hellip; and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But when it comes to rulings such as what is permissible and \r\n    what is prohibited, and the details of acts of worship, this is where Islam \r\n    differs from Judaism and the Qur&rsquo;an differs from the Torah. God, may He be \r\n    exalted, says in the Holy Qur&rsquo;an (interpretation of the meaning): <i>\r\n    &ldquo;To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear \r\n    way&rdquo;[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:48]<\/i>. So each nation has its own \r\n    laws concerning what is permitted and what is forbidden, as it has its own \r\n    acts of worship by which it worships Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave \r\n    the likeness of the agreement of all the Prophets on the basic matter of \r\n    religion, which is affirmation of the Oneness of God (Tawheed), beliefs and \r\n    worship of God alone, with no partner or associate, and the differences \r\n    between their laws, when he said: &ldquo;The Prophets are half-brothers; their \r\n    mothers differ but their religion is one.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari and \r\n    Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Half-brothers refers to brothers from the same father, with \r\n    different mothers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the basis of the religion of the Prophets is one, namely \r\n    affirmation of the Oneness of God (Tawheed), and worshipping God with no \r\n    partner or associate, but the details of laws and rulings is what is \r\n    different.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And this is what is in accordance with wisdom.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Adam (peace be upon him) had a law that was suited to him and \r\n    his children, and was suited to the time in which he lived. In his law &ndash; for \r\n    example &ndash; a brother could marry his sister, because it was not possible to \r\n    perpetuate the family and produce offspring at that time in any other way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then as time passed, the laws changed to suit the new nations \r\n    and new times. Hence in the laws of the Jews it is forbidden for a brother \r\n    to marry his sister, even though that was permitted in the law of Adam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For Jacob (peace be upon him), all kinds of food were \r\n    permissible and he was the one who forbade some things to himself, and those \r\n    prohibitions became entrenched and became a law for him and his children. \r\n    Concerning that God, may He be exalted, says in the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;All food was \r\n    lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful for \r\n    himself before the Taurat (Torah) was revealed&rdquo; [Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:93]<\/i>. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then came the law of Jesus (peace be upon him), which was \r\n    more lenient than the law of Moses. God permitted to the Christians (the \r\n    followers of the Messiah, peace be upon him) some things that had been \r\n    forbidden in the law of Moses. Concerning this God, may He be exalted, tells \r\n    us that Jesus (peace be upon him) said (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and to make lawful to you part of what was \r\n    forbidden to you&rdquo; [Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:50]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then came the law of the Qur&rsquo;aan, the law of Muhammad \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which also differed from previous \r\n    laws in some rulings, as had happened before that in the case of Judaism and \r\n    Christianity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because the law of the Qur&rsquo;aan is the final law that will \r\n    abide until the Day of Resurrection, it is the most complete of laws, the \r\n    best and the most lenient, and in it is flexibility that is suited to all \r\n    times and places until the Hour begins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the reason for the differences between the rulings of \r\n    the Torah and the rulings of the Qur&rsquo;aan, as the Torah was specifically for \r\n    the Children of Israel alone, and its rulings were not meant to be permanent \r\n    and ongoing until the Day of Resurrection. Although most of the rulings of \r\n    the Torah remained in effect after that in Christianity, and only differed \r\n    in making permissible some things that had been forbidden, the rulings of \r\n    the Torah, and the Gospel after it, were limited in terms of time and all of \r\n    that came to an end at the appointed time, which was the coming of the \r\n    Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). A covenant had \r\n    been taken from the Prophets who came before him that if he was sent when \r\n    any of them were still alive, they would abandon whatever they had and \r\n    follow him. God, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the \r\n    Prophets, saying: &lsquo;Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah \r\n    (understanding of the Laws of Allah, etc.), and afterwards there will come \r\n    to you a Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) \r\n    confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.&rsquo; \r\n    Allah said: &lsquo;Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I \r\n    conclude with you)?&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;We agree.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Then bear witness; and \r\n    I am with you among the witnesses (for this).&rsquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Fasiqoon \r\n    (rebellious: those who turn away from Allah&rsquo;s Obedience).&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:81-82]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The law of the Qur&rsquo;aan differs from all the laws that came \r\n    before it in that it is suitable for all kinds of people at all times until \r\n    the end of this world.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you were talking about the Torah as it exists now, \r\n    then we have no choice but to tell you of what we really believe &ndash; even if \r\n    that may upset you &ndash; but we hope that you have strong reason and sound \r\n    thinking that will help you to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and \r\n    that this may motivate you to investigate further until you reach the \r\n    truth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This truth is that the Torah as it exists today is not that \r\n    which God sent down to Moses (peace be upon him). Rather it has been \r\n    distorted in all ways, adding, subtracting and changing the meaning. This is \r\n    not the place to expand upon this topic; we are just referring to it in the \r\n    hope that this might motivate you to enquire further.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Torah as it exists today contains material that one must \r\n    be certain is not the words of God; rather it is distortions introduced by \r\n    those who attributed it falsely to God, may He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It contains the ascription of shortcomings to the Lord, may \r\n    He be glorified and exalted, and likens Him to created beings. For example, \r\n    they say that God wrestled with Jacob for an entire night, then Jacob \r\n    overpowered Him! And they say that God regretted having created mankind when \r\n    He saw their disobedience, and He wept until His eyes became swollen, then \r\n    the angels came to visit Him and comfort Him. Exalted be God far above what \r\n    the wrongdoers say.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It contains insults and slander against the Prophets. For \r\n    example, they say that the Prophet of God Aaron made a calf and worshipped \r\n    it along with the Children of Israel. And they say that Lot drank wine until \r\n    he became drunk, then he committed incest with his two daughters, one after \r\n    the other! And they say that Solomon (peace be upon him) apostatised at the \r\n    end of his life and worshipped idols, and built temples for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It includes exaggerations, impossible things and \r\n    contradictions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the books that have been written on this topic are &ldquo;<i>What \r\n    is the Origin of Man?<\/i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>The Bible, the Qur&rsquo;aan and Science<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    by the French scientist and medical doctor Maurice Bucaille, in which he \r\n    proved the existence of scientific errors in the Torah and Gospel, and at \r\n    the same time he proved that there are no contradictions in the Qur&rsquo;aan even \r\n    with modern science and scientific facts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He says in the introduction to his second book (p. 29):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;It was in a totally objective spirit, and without any \r\n    preconceived ideas that I first examined the Qur&rsquo;anic Revelation. I was \r\n    looking for the degree of compatibility between the Qur&rsquo;anic text and the \r\n    data of modern science. I knew from translations that the Qur&rsquo;an often made \r\n    allusion to all sorts of natural phenomena, but I had only a summary \r\n    knowledge of it. It was only when I examined the text very closely in Arabic \r\n    that I kept a list of them at the end of which I had to acknowledge the \r\n    evidence in front of me: the Qur&rsquo;an did not contain a single statement that \r\n    was assailable from a modern scientific point of view.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I repeated the same test for the Old Testament and the \r\n    Gospels, always preserving the same objective outlook. In the former I did \r\n    not even have to go beyond the first book, Genesis, to find statements \r\n    totally out of keeping with the cast-iron facts of modern science.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, we have two reasons why the Torah as it exists \r\n    now differs from the Qur&rsquo;aan:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Differences in the laws of the \r\n    Prophets<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Distortion that crept into the \r\n    Torah and the tampering that happened to it with the passage of time.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask God to show us the truth as truth and enable us to \r\n    follow it, and to show us falsehood as false and enable us to avoid it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11185","question_id":"11185","answers":"<p><span>Praise <span>be<\/span> to\r\nAllah.<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>Firstly:<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>We praise Allah, may He be exalted, for\r\nhaving enabled that sister to enter Islam, and we congratulate her for the\r\ngreatness of this achievement in her life.

We \r\n    think that you are sincere in your intention to look for the truth in order \r\n    to dispel the worries you have and the distress you are feeling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You are quite right not to be happy with this world, and in \r\n    fact if one&rsquo;s heart is filled with grief, depression, anxiety and confusion, \r\n    life will have no meaning. Hence many people who feel that way hasten to \r\n    commit suicide, so as to escape this life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But when you look at the world around you, you will see that \r\n    the Muslims are suffering from wars, poverty, misery and a lot of troubles \r\n    in this world, so perhaps you might expect them to have the highest suicide \r\n    rates of all people. But this is incorrect. Suicide is unknown among the \r\n    Muslims who know their religion and adhere to it, no matter what befalls \r\n    them of hardship, poverty and misery. In fact they hope that the Lord will \r\n    compensate them for that in Paradise with abundance, joy and happiness. In \r\n    contrast we find non-Muslims hastening to commit suicide even though they \r\n    have a life of plenty and they are enjoying good food, drink and housing. \r\n    You even find the highest rates of suicide in the countries with the highest \r\n    individual income in the world. The reason for that is that they are living \r\n    for this world, and when they have had their fill of it and reach saturation \r\n    point, life no longer has any meaning for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whatever befalls a person either leads to a life of ease or a \r\n    life of hardship. Look at different people and how they respond to these two \r\n    things. You will find insolence and ingratitude for blessings at times of \r\n    ease, and you will find panic and depression at times of hardship. But as \r\n    for the believer, he responds to times of ease with gratitude, and he \r\n    responds to times of hardship with patience. This is the true state of the \r\n    believer, because he knows that gratitude for blessings is obligatory, and \r\n    that if he gives thanks the blessing will be prolonged; and he knows that \r\n    panic will not have any good result for himself or for his mental or \r\n    physical wellbeing or his religious commitment; and he knows that the one \r\n    who bears it with patience will have a greater reward from God. Now think \r\n    about what you see of suicide and attempts to escape this world on the part \r\n    of one who is living a life of ease and on the part of one who is living a \r\n    life of hardship, and see how a Muslim reacts to those situations, and you \r\n    will see a great difference between Muslims and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslims do not commit suicide no matter how difficult \r\n    their worldly circumstances, for a number of reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>because Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, has forbidden them to kill themselves<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>because they will lose out in \r\n    the Hereafter by committing suicide; the Lord has warned them of the \r\n    punishment for doing that<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>because they are compensated \r\n    for their misery and hard life by what their Lord honours them with of \r\n    consolation through Islam and obedience to Him. True life for us, in Islam, \r\n    is the life of the heart; true insight for us, in Islam, is the insight of \r\n    the heart. You will find in the Holy Qur&rsquo;an that our Lord, may He be blessed \r\n    and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and \r\n    disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and Faith) and set for him a \r\n    light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the \r\n    darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never \r\n    come out? Thus it is made fairseeming to the disbelievers that which they \r\n    used to do&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-An &lsquo;am 6:122]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Have they not travelled through the land, and have they \r\n    hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear? Verily, it is not \r\n    the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the chests that \r\n    grow blind.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hajj 22:46].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Therefore, although some Muslims may have a hard life, they \r\n    still have comfort in their hearts and physical blindness is not so serious \r\n    for one who has insight in his heart.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted that what you are suffering from of \r\n    anxiety and depression is something from which many of your co-religionists \r\n    suffer. The reason for that is that they have not found any joy in their \r\n    beliefs or happiness in their hearts, and they have not found answers to \r\n    many of the questions they have about their religion even with the most \r\n    senior scholars of their faith. Hence it is natural that they will suffer \r\n    from what you mention of psychological illness. But it is not natural to \r\n    seek to remedy that by committing suicide. Rather we advise you to do what \r\n    thousands and millions of others have done, which is to seek the truth and \r\n    seek happiness. We could tell you now a long list of artists, sports \r\n    players, politicians, writers, literati and highly educated people who found \r\n    happiness and relief from worry by entering Islam. When you watch video \r\n    clips in which some of these people pronounce the twin declaration of faith \r\n    (shahaadatayn) and enter Islam, you will see that the path to happiness has \r\n    begun when they uttered the word of Tawheed (affirmation of the Oneness of \r\n    God). Hence you will see many of them weeping with joy after uttering these \r\n    words. One of the greatest proofs of the truth of what we are saying is what \r\n    you can see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears of those who have \r\n    entered Islam. And in the book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \r\n    you will find that He says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, \r\n    while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him \r\n    We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful \r\n    provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the \r\n    best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[an-Nahl 16:97]<\/i> .&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A good life is not connected to materialcircumstances; rather \r\n    it is the life of the heart, and its joy and happiness stem from obeying \r\n    Allah, and from strong faith in Allah and belief in His will and decree, and \r\n    from certainty that Allah is wise in all that He does.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On the other hand, you will find that the one who turns away \r\n    from believing in Allah lives a hard life in this world, not in the sense of \r\n    material hardship but in the sense of spiritual hardship. You will find that \r\n    in the Book of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither \r\n    believes in this Quran nor acts on its orders, etc.) verily, for him is a \r\n    life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Ta-Ha 20:124]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please note that Islam, which are all calling you to enter \r\n    and we think that in certainty of faith you will find solutions to the \r\n    depression you are suffering, is the last of the religions in chronological \r\n    terms. Allah, may He be exalted, sent His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) to all people. This religion is in harmony with \r\n    sound human nature and there is nothing in its rulings that is contrary to \r\n    reason. It is the religion of Moses, Jesus, Abraham and all the Prophets \r\n    (peace be upon them). We are not calling you to enter the religion brought \r\n    by the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) separate \r\n    from what came before it; rather it is the religion of all the Prophets and \r\n    Messengers (peace be upon them all). Hence the one who believes in this \r\n    religion and this Prophet (peace be upon him) is following the path that was \r\n    followed by all the Prophets and Messengers (peace be upon them). And that \r\n    will lead you to Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, with which \r\n    Allah will honour those Prophets and Messengers. But if you believe that \r\n    Jesus (peace be upon him) is the son of God or is God &ndash; exalted be Allah far \r\n    above that &ndash; then you will not find any of those Prophets or Messengers \r\n    following the same path, and amazingly you will never find Jesus (peace be \r\n    upon him) with you, because he is the slave of Allah, who affirmed the \r\n    Oneness of his Lord and declared Him to be above having a partner or son. \r\n    Rather you will find yourself in the company of those who worshipped the \r\n    stars, heavenly bodies and idols and those who worshipped things other than \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    By Allah, we do not wish you anything but good, and we advise \r\n    you to flee to Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to turn to Him \r\n    alone and no one else. So affirm His Oneness and believe in His religion \r\n    with which He ended the series of messages and enjoined all people to enter \r\n    it. By Allah, we assure you with all certainty that entering Islam is what \r\n    will relieve you of your worries and distress, and you will never find \r\n    happiness in any other religion. So save yourself from the hell of this \r\n    world that is burning your heart and from the fire of Hell in the Hereafter \r\n    which will be your fate &ndash; Allah forbid &ndash; if you refuse to enter this \r\n    religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Understand that simply by testifying that Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, is One and that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    is His Messenger, you will thus become a Muslim who affirms the Oneness of \r\n    Allah and worships Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of \r\n    all things. If a person turns sincerely Allah, his Lord will never let him \r\n    down and he will find the happiness he is seeking. You will never find any \r\n    closed doors in Islam or any questions that may cross your mind that we \r\n    cannot answer. In fact the specious arguments that are spread by the enemies \r\n    of Islam only increase us in certainty that this religion is from Allah, \r\n    because of what we see in them of bias, fabrication and naivety. So you may \r\n    be certain that you will be following the right path and that it will lead \r\n    you to Allah, may He be exalted, and no one else. You will never find \r\n    anything in it but that which is good for you in this world and in the \r\n    Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We await good news from you that you have decided to follow \r\n    the right path and that you have joined the blessed community of the \r\n    Prophets and Messengers. We are also waiting for any enquiries or questions \r\n    about your new religion that you may need to ask, in sha Allah (if Allah \r\n    wills).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We pray to Allah to guide you and help you to do that, and to \r\n    honour you with that with which He has honoured others who came to Islam \r\n    before you.

It is something from which many \r\n    people benefit, especially non-Muslims. It is a means of spreading the \r\n    religion of Allah, establishing proof for them and leaving no excuse for \r\n    them, and conveying to them the message of their Lord. But this work should \r\n    be done in a thoughtful manner, following guidelines and methods through \r\n    which the aim may be achieved in an appropriate manner without going against \r\n    the rulings of Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Leaflets and pamphlets for da&lsquo;wah purposes that contain \r\n    Qur&rsquo;anic verses do not come under the same rulings as the Mushaf, and the \r\n    one who touches them cannot be said to have touched the Mushaf, because the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;anic material in them is mixed with other material. So they come under \r\n    the same ruling as the ruling on books of fiqh, tafseer and the like, and it \r\n    is permissible for a non-believer or one who is in a state of impurity to \r\n    touch them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the verse that the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) wrote &ndash; i.e., to Heraclius &ndash; his intention \r\n    thereby was to correspond, and a verse in a letter or a book of fiqh and the \r\n    like does not come under the prohibition on touching it, and the book or \r\n    letter does not become a Mushaf. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/109&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible \r\n    for a non-believer to touch the Mushaf if there is the hope that he will \r\n    become a Muslim. They quoted as evidence for that the fact that the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wrote to Heraclius, the ruler of \r\n    Byzantium, (a letter containing) the verse in which Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Say (O \r\n    Muhammad SAW): &lsquo;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a \r\n    word that is just between us and you&rdquo; [Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:64]<\/i>. They said: \r\n    This verse is a verse of the Book of Allah that he wrote to Heraclius. But \r\n    the correct view is that this is not proof; rather it only indicates that it \r\n    is permissible to write one or two verses of the Book of Allah. As for \r\n    handing over the entire Mushaf (to a non-Muslim), it is not proven that the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa Ibn Baaz<\/i>, 24\/340-341&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If these books or leaflets are translated into another \r\n    language, other than Arabic, then the matter is easier. It does not matter \r\n    if the non-believer touches a translation of the meanings of the Holy Qur&rsquo;an \r\n    into a language other than Arabic, even if it is a translation of an entire \r\n    soorah, because the translation is an interpretation of the meanings of the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;an, and it does not come under the same rulings as the Qur&rsquo;an.

The garment should be washed if the dog&rsquo;s saliva gets on it, and the \r\n    meat of game (caught by the dog) should be washed to remove the dog&rsquo;s \r\n    saliva.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, Abu \r\n    &lsquo;Ubayd, Abu Thawr and at-Tabari said: The leftovers of a dog are najis \r\n    (impure) and the vessel should be washed seven times, the first of which \r\n    should be with dust or soil.

Regardless of whether the vessel contained water or something other \r\n    than water, it is taahir (pure), but one should wash the vessel seven times. \r\n    However, one may do wudoo&rsquo; with the water that was licked, and the food and \r\n    drink that were licked may be consumed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu &lsquo;Umar said: Those (scholars) who were of the view that \r\n    dogs are not najis (impure) say that their leftovers are taahir (pure) but \r\n    the vessel should be washed seven times if the dog licked it.

Purification is basically \r\n    prescribed to remove major or minor ritual impurity (ghusl and wudoo&rsquo;) or \r\n    wash off impure substances. The rulings on ritual impurity cannot apply to \r\n    vessels, thus it is known that the aim here is to remove an impure \r\n    substance. Once it is proven that the dog&rsquo;s tongue, with which it drinks the \r\n    water, is najis (impure) and it is obligatory to purify the water from that, \r\n    it is known that all the parts (of the dog) are impure, like its tongue. So \r\n    if any part of its body touches one, it must be purified. It also clearly \r\n    shows that purification cannot be done with less than seven washings, and \r\n    that rubbing it once with dust or soil is obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obvious that the reason for using dust is to achieve a \r\n    thorough purification. This highlights the high degree of the dog&rsquo;s \r\n    impurity. Therefore, other means of purification, such as potash and the \r\n    like [used as cleansing substances], that are very effective in \r\n    purification, may also be used in place of dust or soil.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Ma&lsquo;aalim as-Sunan<\/i> (1\/93)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As-San&lsquo;aani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth \r\n    points to several rulings:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly, the dog&rsquo;s mouth is najis, because of the instruction \r\n    to wash anything that the dog licks and pour away the water. He said &ldquo;The \r\n    purification of the vessel of one of you&rdquo;, because there is no washing \r\n    except in the case of ritual impurity or contamination with an impure \r\n    substance. There is no ritual impurity in this case, therefore what is meant \r\n    is contamination with an impure substance. Pouring it away is wasting the \r\n    water; If the water was taahir (pure), he would not have instructed them to \r\n    waste it, because he had forbidden them to waste water. This clearly \r\n    indicates that the dog&rsquo;s mouth is najis (impure), and the rest of the dog&rsquo;s \r\n    body is deemed to be the same, by analogy. That is because if it is proven \r\n    that the dog&rsquo;s saliva is najis, and its saliva is part of its mouth, as it \r\n    is the sweat of its mouth, then its mouth is najis, because sweat is part of \r\n    what comes from the body, so the rest of its body is the same&hellip; End quote \r\n    from <i>Subul as-Salaam<\/i> (1\/22).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if the dog puts its tongue or its foot or any \r\n    other part of its body in the water, the water becomes najis (impure); hence \r\n    the water must be poured away and the vessel must be washed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the water that was licked by the dog spills onto your \r\n    clothes or your body, and you are certain or think it most likely that it \r\n    got onto your clothes or your body, then you have to wash the place affected \r\n    by the impurity seven times, one of which should be with dust or soil, or \r\n    whatever may take its place of cleansing substances such as soap, because \r\n    dust may be harmful. But if you think it most likely that the water did not \r\n    reach your clothes or your body, then you do not have to do anything, \r\n    because the basic principle is that things are taahir (pure), but in this \r\n    case there is some doubt concerning najaasah (impurity).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to lapping up (water), saliva comes out of the \r\n    dog when it does this. If the dog&rsquo;s saliva gets onto one&rsquo;s clothes or \r\n    anything else, then they should be washed seven times. But we do not say \r\n    that one of them should be with dust or soil, because that might be harmful. \r\n    Rather we say that instead of dust one should use soap or something similar \r\n    to remove the impurity, and that, with the seven washings, is sufficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Liqa&rsquo; al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i>, no. 49&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Note: it is not permissible to keep dogs except for a need \r\n    such as guarding or hunting.

He (the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) said: &ldquo;I am closer to \r\n    Moosa than they are.&rdquo; So he fasted on that day and issued instructions to \r\n    fast on that day.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3216&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When he saw the Jews doing that, was it when he first came to \r\n    Madinah in Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal, or was it later on, in the month of Muharram?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are two scholarly views; the more correct view is that \r\n    his seeing them, that discussion and that command to fast occurred in \r\n    Muharram, i.e., in the second year after he (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) arrived in Madinah, and from that we may conclude that the Jews \r\n    followed the lunar calendar in commemorating that day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people were confused by this and said: The Messenger of \r\n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah in the \r\n    month of Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal, so how come Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said that when he came to \r\n    Madinah, he found the Jews fasting on the day of &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo;?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the first issue, which is that when he came to \r\n    Madinah, he found them fasting on the day of &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo;, this does not \r\n    indicate that on the day of his arrival he found them observing that fast. \r\n    He arrived on a Monday, the twelfth of Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal, but the first he \r\n    knew of that was in the second year after his arrival in Madinah, and it did \r\n    not happen when he was in Makkah. This is if the people of the Book worked \r\n    out the date for this fast according to the lunar calendar.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad fi Hadiy Khayr al-&lsquo;Ibaad<\/i>, \r\n    2\/66&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The apparent meaning of the report was problematic to some \r\n    people, because it appears to mean that when the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) arrived in Madinah, he found the Jews fasting \r\n    the day of &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo;, but he arrived in Madinah in Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal. The \r\n    answer to that is that what is meant is that his first knowing of that and \r\n    asking about it happened after he came to Madinah; he had no knowledge of \r\n    that before he came there. What the hadeeth implies is that the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and stayed until \r\n    the day of &lsquo;Aashoora&rsquo;, when he found the Jews fasting on that day.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/247&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Was the calendar that the Jews used for that fast of theirs \r\n    based on lunar or solar months?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we say that it was based on lunar months, as stated above, \r\n    then there is no problem, because the tenth of Muharram does not change \r\n    every year. But if we say that it was based on solar months, then there is a \r\n    problem, because this day will change every year (in relation to the lunar \r\n    calendar) and will not always coincide with the tenth day of Muharram.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned this \r\n    difference of opinion, and explained that he was of the view that their \r\n    calendar was based on the solar months, so when the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) saw the Jews fasting on that day, it was in \r\n    Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal when he first came to Madinah, and the date based on the \r\n    solar calendar coincided with his arrival. With regard to the real day on \r\n    which Allah saved Moosa, it was the tenth of Muharram, but because they \r\n    followed a solar calendar, they got the day wrong.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If they followed the solar calendar, there is no confusion \r\n    about the meaning of the hadeeth, and the day on which Allah saved Moosa was \r\n    the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; in Muharram. Thus the people of the Book worked it out \r\n    according to a solar calendar, and that coincided with the Prophet&rsquo;s arrival \r\n    in Madinah in Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal. The fast observed by the people of the Book \r\n    was worked out according to a solar calendar, whereas the Muslims&rsquo; fast is \r\n    according to the lunar calendar, as is their pilgrimage and all important \r\n    occasions that are obligatory or recommended. The Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;We are closer to Moosa than you.&rdquo; Thus it \r\n    becomes clear that the Muslims should have a greater reason to venerate that \r\n    day and work out when it is, and that they (the Jews) got it wrong, because \r\n    they were using a solar calendar, as the Christians got it wrong with regard \r\n    to their fast, when they put it in a particular season of the year, with the \r\n    result that it could coincide with any lunar month.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad fi Hadiy Khayr al-&lsquo;Ibaad<\/i>, \r\n    2\/69, 70&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr mentioned this possible interpretation, \r\n    and refuted it, and he refuted Ibn al-Qayyim&rsquo;s favouring of this view. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the later scholars said: It may be that their fast \r\n    was worked out according to the solar calendar, which does not rule out the \r\n    possibility of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; occurring in Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal, which would resolve \r\n    the problem (of understanding the hadeeth) altogether. This was stated by \r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim in <i>al-Hadiy<\/i>, where he said: The fast observed by the \r\n    people of the Book was worked out according to a solar calendar. But I say: \r\n    What he claimed of the problem being resolved is strange, because it leads \r\n    to another problem, which is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) instructed the Muslims to fast &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; according to the lunar \r\n    calendar, and it is known how the Muslims fasted &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; in all eras: it \r\n    was in Muharram and not in any other month. Yes, I found a report in \r\n    at-Tabaraani with a jayyid isnaad from Zayd ibn Thaabit who said: The day of \r\n    &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; is not the day people say it is; rather it is the day on which the \r\n    cover of the Ka&lsquo;bah replaced and the Abyssinians play with swords and other \r\n    tools of war, and was not fixed in one (lunar) month. The people used to go \r\n    to So and so, the Jew, and ask him when it was; when he died they came to \r\n    Zayd ibn Thaabit and asked him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, the way to reconcile the reports is to say \r\n    that it was originally like that (based on a solar calendar), then when the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the Muslims to \r\n    fast &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, he based it on the shar&lsquo;i ruling, which is to base it on the \r\n    lunar calendar, and the Muslims followed that. But with regard to the claim \r\n    that the people of the Book based their fast on a solar calendar, that is \r\n    subject to further discussion. The Jews base their fast on a lunar calendar, \r\n    and this is what we have seen them do. It may be that among them were some \r\n    who followed a solar calendar, but there are none who do that now, just as \r\n    those of whom Allah has told us that they said that &lsquo;Uzayr was a son of God \r\n    no longer exist. Exalted be Allah far above that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 7\/267; see also \r\n    4\/247&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Elsewhere in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar says, \r\n    commenting on the report of at-Tabaraani:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I came across something similar in <i>al-Athaar al-Qadeemah<\/i> \r\n    by Abu&rsquo;r-Rayhaan al-Bayrooni, and what he said, in brief, was: the ignorant \r\n    among the Jews base their fasts and festivals on astronomical calculations, \r\n    so their year is solar, not lunar. I say: Hence they need someone who has \r\n    knowledge of such calculations, so that they can rely on him for that \r\n    purpose.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/247, 248&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the report of Zayd ibn Thaabit that was \r\n    mentioned by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him), and to which \r\n    he responded, al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) has \r\n    discussed its isnaad and text.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This suggests that \r\n    &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; is not in Muharram; rather its date is worked out according to the \r\n    solar calendar, as the people of the Book do, and this is contrary to the \r\n    practice of the Muslims in earlier times. Ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad is not to be \r\n    relied on in reports that are narrated only by him. He regarded the entire \r\n    hadeeth as being from Zayd ibn Thaabit, and the latter part of it is not fit \r\n    to be the words of Zayd, so perhaps that is the words of another narrator. \r\n    And Allah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Lataa&rsquo;if al-Ma&lsquo;aarif<\/i>, p. 53&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -4-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One may ask: how come the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) believe what the Jews said about the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; \r\n    being the day on which Moosa and those who were with him were saved? This is \r\n    what the Raafidis ask with evil ulterior motives, so as to cast aspersions \r\n    on the hadeeths which encourage fasting on the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, and so as \r\n    to support their claim that this is one of the innovations introduced by the \r\n    Umayyads!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Maaziri (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this \r\n    issue and the response to it:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the Jews say is not to be accepted (and taken as true), \r\n    so it may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    received revelation that confirmed what they said, or that he heard about \r\n    that from many different sources, so that he concluded that it was true.

Then \r\n    (later on) the Prophet (sa) parted his hair.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3728&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is a sign of Imam al-Bukhaari&rsquo;s understanding of the \r\n    religion that he narrated this hadeeth after the two hadeeths of Abu Moosa \r\n    and Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them) that speak of the fast of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Abbaas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) fasted it (&lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;) may have come under the heading of \r\n    doing the same as them (the people of the Book) in that regard, because that \r\n    was a good deed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may be said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave him \r\n    permission to fast on that day, then when he came to Madinah, he found the \r\n    Jews fasting on that day, so he asked them about what motivated them to \r\n    observe that fast. They told him what Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas mentioned, that it was a \r\n    great day, on which Allah saved Moosa and his people, and drowned Pharaoh \r\n    and his people, so Moosa fasted that day in gratitude, so we fast it too. \r\n    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;We have more \r\n    right and are closer to Moosa than you.&rdquo; So at that time he fasted this day \r\n    in Madinah and issued instructions to fast on that day, i.e., he made it \r\n    obligatory to fast it and confirmed his instructions, to such an extent that \r\n    they would make little children fast as well. The Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) adhered to that, as did his Companions, until \r\n    the month of Ramadan was made obligatory and fasting the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; \r\n    was abrogated. At that time he said: &ldquo;Allah has not prescribed fasting this \r\n    day for you.&rdquo; Then he gave them the choice between fasting it or not fasting \r\n    it, but the virtue attached to it remained in place, because he said \r\n    &ldquo;However I am fasting,&rdquo; as it says in the hadeeth of Mu&lsquo;aawiyah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) did not fast the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; in emulation of the Jews, \r\n    because he used to fast it before he came to them and before he knew \r\n    anything about them; rather what happened was that he made it obligatory, in \r\n    hope of softening the Jews&rsquo; hearts and win them over to Islam, just as was \r\n    the reason for facing towards their qiblah. That period was the time when \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) liked to do the same \r\n    as the people of the Book in matters that he had not been forbidden to do \r\n    so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhees Kitaab Muslim<\/i>, \r\n    3\/191-192&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whatever the case, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) did not fast it in emulation of them &ndash; i.e., the Jews &ndash; because he used \r\n    to fast it before that, and that was at the time when the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) liked to do the same as the people of the \r\n    Book in matters that he had not been forbidden to do so.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/248&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -6-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have seen above from the comments of the scholars that \r\n    which indicates that the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; was known to Quraysh and to the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Makkah, and they used \r\n    to venerate it and indeed fast it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) fasted it with them, and on that day they used to put the new \r\n    cover on the Ka&lsquo;bah. So how can anyone, after all this, falsely claim that \r\n    &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; is an Umayyad innovation at the time when it is clearly mentioned \r\n    in the proven, saheeh hadeeths?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    her) said: Quraysh used to fast on &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; during the Jaahiliyyah, and the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to fast \r\n    on (that day) too. When he migrated to Madinah, he fasted this day and \r\n    ordered that this fast be observed. When the month of Ramadaan was enjoined, \r\n    he said: &ldquo;Whoever wishes may fast on (this day) and whoever wishes may \r\n    forsake it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1794); Muslim (1125).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abdullah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated \r\n    that the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to fast on the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, and \r\n    the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the \r\n    Muslims fasted it before Ramadaan was made obligatory. When the month of \r\n    Ramadaan was made obligatory, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo; &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; is one of the days of Allah, so whoever \r\n    wishes may fast it and whoever wishes may omit it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Muslim (1126).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have quoted the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar here so as to refute \r\n    the Raafidis and those who followed them in their ignorance, who claim that \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was the only one who narrated the \r\n    report about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasting \r\n    &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; in Makkah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abdullah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated \r\n    from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a report similar \r\n    to that of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah concerning this matter. It was also narrated by \r\n    &lsquo;Ubaydullah ibn &lsquo;Umar and&nbsp; Ayyoob, from Naafi&lsquo;, from Ibn &lsquo;Umar that he said \r\n    concerning the fast of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) fasted it and instructed (the people) to fast \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>At-Tamheed lima fi&rsquo;l-Muwatta&rsquo; min al-Ma&lsquo;aani wa&rsquo;l-Asaaneed<\/i>, \r\n    7\/207&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we conclude from these hadeeths is that during the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah, the kuffaar of Quraysh and others, and the Jews, fasted on the \r\n    day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;. Islam confirmed fasting on this day, then the ruling on \r\n    fasting it became less emphatic.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i>, 8\/9, 10&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Abbaas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her): \r\n    &ldquo;Quryash used to fast &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo; during the Jaahiliyyah,&rdquo; indicate that \r\n    fasting on this day was known to them to be prescribed and they were aware \r\n    of its virtue.

Similarly, it is not valid for a free, chaste woman to be given in \r\n    marriage to a man who is immoral and unchaste, unless he repents sincerely, \r\n    because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<\/i><\/span><i><span>Such \r\n    a thing is forbidden to the believers<\/span><span>&rdquo; \r\n    [an-Noor 24:3]<\/span><\/i><span>. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd \r\n    ar-Rahmaan as-Sa&lsquo;di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What this verse \r\n    means is that if a person commits zina, man or woman, and has not repented \r\n    from that, then the one who wants to marry him or her even though Allah has \r\n    forbidden that, must be:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>\r\n    either one who does not adhere to the rulings of Allah and \r\n    His Messenger, and such a person cannot be anything other than a mushrik;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>\r\n    or if he does adhere to the rulings of Allah and His \r\n    Messenger, but he wants to marry this person even though he is aware of her \r\n    zina, then this marriage itself is zina, and the one who wants to get \r\n    married is an adulterer and unchaste.

He said: This is the ruling from \r\n    Allah, so it is not permissible for the fornicator on whom the hadd \r\n    punishment has been carried out to marry any but a woman on whom the hadd \r\n    punishment has been carried out. Ibraaheem an-Nakha&lsquo;i said something \r\n    similar.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In <i>Musannaf Abi \r\n    Dawood<\/i> it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) \r\n    said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;No fornicator on whom the hadd punishment has been carried out should \r\n    marry anyone but one who is like him.&rdquo; And it was narrated that one on whom \r\n    the hadd punishment had been carried out (because of fornication) married \r\n    one on whom it has not been carried out (i.e., one who was chaste), and &lsquo;Ali \r\n    (may Allah be pleased with him) separated them.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The correct view \r\n    is that the description &ldquo;one who has been flogged&rdquo; in the hadeeth refers to \r\n    one who is known to have committed zina and it has been proven against him, \r\n    and that can only apply to one on whom the hadd punishment has been carried \r\n    out. Therefore what the hadeeth means is: it is not permissible for a chaste \r\n    woman to marry one who is known to have committed zina, and it is not \r\n    permissible for a man to marry a woman who is known to have &nbsp;committed zina. \r\n    So the meaning of the hadeeth is in accordance with the meaning of the verse \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning) <i>&ldquo;<\/i><\/span><i><span>The \r\n    adulterer marries not but an adulteress...<\/span><span>&rdquo; \r\n    [an-Noor 24:3],<\/span><\/i><span> \r\n    and reinforces that meaning.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ash-Shawkaani (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) said: The words &ldquo;the fornicator who has been \r\n    flogged&rdquo; refer to one who is known to have committed zina. This indicates \r\n    that it is not permissible for a woman to marry a man who is known to have \r\n    committed zina; similarly, it is not permissible for a man to marry a woman \r\n    who is known to have committed zina. This is indicated by the verse \r\n    mentioned in the book, because at the end of it it says<i>&ldquo;<\/i><\/span><i><span>Such \r\n    a thing is forbidden to the believers<\/span><span>&rdquo; \r\n    [an-Noor 24:3]<\/span><\/i><span>. \r\n    End quote from <i>Nayl al-Awtaar<\/i>, 6\/201&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Based on the \r\n    above, if the woman regrets what she fell into of fornication and repented \r\n    from it before that man married her, then the marriage contract is valid. \r\n    But she has to conceal her (past misconduct) and not tell anyone about what \r\n    she did previously.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>But if the \r\n    marriage contract was done before she repented from zina, then the opinion \r\n    on which fatwas on this website are based is that the marriage is not valid \r\n    and the marriage contract must be re-done.

Nothing to that\r\n    effect has been reported in any saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) or from his Companions. None of the imaams of the Muslims encouraged\r\n    or recommended such things, neither the four imaams, nor any others. No reliable scholars\r\n    have narrated anything like this, neither from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him), nor from the Sahaabah, nor from the Taabi&#146;een; neither in any saheeh\r\n    report or in a da&#146;eef (weak) report; neither in the books of <i>Saheeh<\/i>, nor in <i>al-Sunan<\/i>,\r\n    nor in the <i>Musnads<\/i>. No hadeeth of this nature was known during the best centuries,\r\n    but some of the later narrators reported ahaadeeth like the one which says &#147;Whoever\r\n    puts kohl in his eyes on the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; will not suffer from eye disease\r\n    in that year, and whoever takes a bath (does ghusl) on the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146;\r\n    will not get sick in that year, etc.&#148; They also narrated reports concerning the\r\n    supposed virtues of praying on the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146;, and other reports saying\r\n    that on the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; Adam repented, the Ark settled on Mount Joodi,\r\n    Yoosuf returned to Ya&#146;qoob, Ibraaheem was saved from the fire, the ram was provided\r\n    for sacrifice instead of Ismaa&#146;eel, and so on. They also reported a fabricated\r\n    hadeeth that is falsely attributed to the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him), which says, &#147;Whoever is generous to his family on the day of\r\n    &#145;Aashooraa&#146;, Allaah will be generous to him for the rest of the year.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>(Then Ibn Taymiyah discussed the two misguided groups who were in\r\n    Koofah, Iraq, both of whom took &#145;Aashooraa&#146; as a festival because of their\r\n    bid&#146;ah). The Raafidi group made an outward show of allegiance to the Ahl al-Bayt\r\n    although inwardly they were either heretics and disbelievers or ignorant and bound by\r\n    whims and desires. The Naasibi group hated &#145;Ali and his companions, because of the\r\n    troubles and killings that had occurred. It is reported in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> that the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;In (the tribe of) Thaqeef\r\n    there will be a liar and an oppressor [???].&#148; The liar was al-Mukhtaar ibn Abi\r\n    &#145;Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who made an outward show of allegiance to and support of the Ahl\r\n    al-Bayt, and killed &#145;Ubayd-Allaah ibn Ziyaad, the governor of Iraq, who had equipped\r\n    the party that killed al-Husayn ibn &#145;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with them both); then\r\n    he (al-Mukhtaar) made it clear that he was a liar, by claiming to be a prophet and that\r\n    Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought revelation to him. People told Ibn &#145;Umar and Ibn\r\n    &#145;Abbaas about this, and said to one of them, &#147;al-Mukhtaar ibn Abi &#145;Ubayd is\r\n    claiming to receive revelation [<i>annahu yanzilu &#145;alayhi<\/i>].&#148; He said,\r\n    &#147;He is telling the truth, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#145;Shall\r\n    I inform you (O people) upon whom the shayaateen (devils) descend [tanazzalu]? They\r\n    descend upon every lying, sinful person.&#146; [al-Shu&#146;ara&#146; 26:221]<\/i>.&#148; [Translator&#146;s\r\n    note: the words translated as &#147;receive revelation&#148; and &#147;descend&#148; both\r\n    come from the same root in Arabic]. They said to the other:\r\n    &#147;Al-Mukhtaar is claiming that he receives inspiration.&#148; He said, &#147;he is\r\n    telling the truth. <i>&#145;&#133; And certainly, the Shayaateen (devils) do inspire their\r\n    friends (from mankind) to dispute with you&#133;&#146; [al-An&#146;aam 6:121 &#150;\r\n    interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>.&#148; As for the oppressor , this was al-Hajjaaj ibn\r\n    Yoosuf al-Thaqafi, who was opposed to &#145;Ali and his companions. Al-Hajjaaj was a\r\n    Naasibi and al-Mukhtaar was a Raafidi, and this Raafidi was a greater liar and more guilty\r\n    of fabrication and heresy, because he claimed to be a prophet&#133;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There was much trouble and fighting between these two groups in Kufa.\r\n    When al-Husayn ibn &#145;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with them both) was killed on the day\r\n    of &#145;Aashooraa&#146;, he was killed by the sinful, wrongdoing group. Allaah honoured\r\n    al-Husayn with martyrdom, as He honoured other members of his family, and raised his\r\n    status, as He honoured Hamzah, Ja&#146;far, his father &#145;Ali and others. Al-Husayn and\r\n    his brother al-Hasan are the leaders of the youth of Paradise. High status can only be\r\n    attained through suffering, as the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him\r\n    said, when he was asked which people suffer the most. He said, &#147;The Prophets, then\r\n    righteous people, then the next best and the next best. A man will suffer according to his\r\n    level of faith. If his faith is solid, he will suffer more, but if his faith is shaky, he\r\n    will suffer less. The believer will keep on suffering until he walks on the earth with no\r\n    sin.&#148; (reported by al-Tirmidhi and others). Al-Hasan and\r\n    al-Husayn achieved what they achieved and reached the high status they reached by the help\r\n    and decree of Allaah. They did not suffer as much as their forefathers had, for they were\r\n    born and raised during the glory days of Islam, and the Muslims respected and honoured\r\n    them. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died when they were still\r\n    young, and Allaah blessed them by testing them in such a manner that they would be able to\r\n    catch up with the rest of their family members, as those who were of a higher status than\r\n    them were also tested. &#145;Ali ibn Abi Taalib was better than them, and he was killed as\r\n    a shaheed (martyr). The killing of al-Husayn was one of the things that caused fitnah\r\n    (tribulation) among the people, as was the killing of &#145;Uthmaan, which was one of the\r\n    greatest causes of fitnah, because of which the ummah is still split today. Thus the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;There are three things,\r\n    whoever is saved from them is truly saved: my death, the killing of a patient khaleefah,\r\n    and the Dajjaal (&#145;antichrist&#146;).&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Then Shaykh al-Islam (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned a little\r\n    about the biography of al-Hasan and his just character, then he said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;Then he died, and Allaah was pleased with him and honoured him.\r\n    Some groups wrote to al-Husayn and promised to support and help him if he went ahead and\r\n    declared himself khaleefah, but they were not sincere. When al-Husayn sent his cousin [son\r\n    of his paternal uncle] to them, they broke their word and gave help to the one they had\r\n    promised to defend him against, and fought with him against [al-Husayn&#146;s cousin].\r\n    Those who were wise and who loved al-Husayn, such as Ibn &#145;Abbaas and Ibn &#145;Umar\r\n    and others, advised him not to go to them, and not to accept any promises from them. They\r\n    thought that his going to them served no useful interest and that the consequences would\r\n    not be good. Things turned out just as they said, and this is how Allaah decreed it would\r\n    happen. When al-Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) went out and saw that things were\r\n    not as he had expected, he asked them to let him go back, or to let him join the army that\r\n    was defending the borders of Islam, or join his cousin Yazeed, but they would not let him\r\n    do any of these things unless he gave himself up to them as a prisoner. So he fought with\r\n    them, and they killed him and some of those who were with him, and he was wrongfully slain\r\n    so he died as a shaheed whose martyrdom brought him honour from Allaah, and so he was\r\n    reunited with the good and pure members of his family. His murder brought shame on those\r\n    who had wrongfully killed him, and caused much mischief among the people. An ignorant,\r\n    wrongful group &#150; who were either heretics and hypocrites, or misguided and misled\r\n    &#150; made a show of allegiance to him and the members of his household, so they took the\r\n    day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; as a day of mourning and wailing, in which they openly\r\n    displayed the rituals of jaahiliyyah such as slapping their cheeks and rending their\r\n    garments, grieving in the manner of the jaahiliyyah. But what Allaah has commanded us to\r\n    do when disaster strikes &#150; when the disaster is fresh &#150; is to bear it with\r\n    patience and fortitude, and to seek reward, and to remember that all things come from\r\n    Allaah and we must return to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133;\r\n    but give glad tidings to al-saabiroon (the patient ones), who, when afflicted with\r\n    calamity, say: &#145;Truly, to Allaah we belong and turly, to Him we shall return.&#146;\r\n    They are those on whom are al-salawaat (the blessings) (i.e., who are blessed and will be\r\n    forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who\r\n    are the guided ones.&#148; [al-Baqarah 2:155-157]<\/i> . <\/p>\r\n    <p>It is reported in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;he is not one of us who strikes his cheeks,\r\n    rends his garments and prays with the prayer of Jaahiliyyah.&#148; And he said: &#147;I\r\n    have nothing to do with those who strike [their cheeks], shave [their heads] and rend\r\n    [their garments].&#148; And he said: &#147;If the woman who wails does not repent before\r\n    she dies, she will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection wearing trousers made of tar\r\n    and a shirt of scabs.&#148; In <i>al-Musnad<\/i>, it is reported from Faatimah bint\r\n    al-Husayn, from her father al-Husayn, that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) said: &#147;There is no man who suffers a calamity, and when he remembers it,\r\n    even if it is old, he says &#145;<i>Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji&#146;oon<\/i>\r\n    (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),&#146; but Allaah will give\r\n    a reward equal to the reward He gave him on the day he suffered the calamity.&#148; This\r\n    is how Allaah honours the Believers. If the disaster suffered by al-Husayn, and other\r\n    disasters, are mentioned after all this time, we should say &#147;<i>Innaa Lillaahi wa\r\n    innaa ilayhi raaji&#146;oon<\/i> (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall\r\n    return),&#148; as Allaah and His Messenger commanded, so as to be given the reward like\r\n    that earned on the day of the disaster itself. If Allaah commanded us to be patient and\r\n    steadfast and to seek reward at the time of the disaster, then how about after the passing\r\n    of time? The Shaytaan made this attractive to those who are misled, so they took the day\r\n    of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; as an occasion of mourning, when they grieve and wail, recite\r\n    poems of grief and tell stories filled with lies. Whatever truth there may be in these\r\n    stories serves no purpose other than the renewal of their grief and sectarian feeling, and\r\n    the stirring up of hatred and hostility among the Muslims, which they do by cursing those\r\n    who came before them, and telling many lies, and causing much trouble in the world. The\r\n    various sects of Islam have never known any group tell more lies or cause more trouble or\r\n    help the kuffaar against the Muslims more than this misguided and evil group. They are\r\n    even worse than the Khawaarij who went beyond the pale of Islam. They are the ones of whom\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;They will kill the\r\n    people of Islam and will leave alone the people who worship idols.&#148; This group\r\n    cooperated with the Jews, Christians and mushrikeen against the members of the\r\n    Prophet&#146;s household and his believing ummah, and also helped the mushrik Turks and\r\n    Tatars to do what they did in Baghdaad and elsewhere to the descendents of the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), i.e., the &#145;Abbaasid rulers and others,\r\n    and the believers; the Turks and Tatars killed them, enslaved their women and destroyed\r\n    their homes. The evil and harm that they do to the Muslims cannot be enumerated by any\r\n    man, no matter how eloquent he is. Some others &#150; either Naasibis who oppose and have\r\n    enmity towards al-Husayn and his family or ignorant people who try to fight evil with\r\n    evil, corruption with corruption, lies with lies and bid&#146;ah with bid&#146;ah &#150;\r\n    opposed them by fabricating reports in favour of making the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; a\r\n    day of celebration, by wearing kohl and henna, spending money on one's children, cooking\r\n    special dishes and other things that are done on Eids and special occasions. These people\r\n    took the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; as a festival like Eid, whereas the others took it\r\n    as a day of mourning. Both are wrong, and both go against the Sunnah, even though the\r\n    other group (the Rafidis) are worse in intention and more ignorant and more plainly\r\n    wrong&#133; But Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well. The Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Those of you who live after my\r\n    death will see many disputes. I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the sunnah of my\r\n    rightly-guided successors (al-khulafa&#146; al-raashidoon) who come after me. Hold onto it\r\n    as if biting it with your eyeteeth. Beware of newly-innovated matters, for every\r\n    innovation is a going astray.&#148; Neither the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) nor his rightly-guided successors (the khulafa&#146; al-raashidoon) did any of\r\n    these things on the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146;, they neither made it a day of mourning\r\n    nor a day of celebration.<\/p>\r\n    <p>But &#147;when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    came to Madeenah, he saw the Jews fasting on the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146;. He said,\r\n    &#145;What is this?&#146; They said, &#145;This is the day when Allaah saved Moosa from\r\n    drowning, so we fast on this day.&#146; He said, &#145;We have more right to Moosa than\r\n    you,&#146; so he fasted on that day and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Quraysh also used to venerate this day during the Jaahiliyyah. The day\r\n    on which people were ordered to fast was just one day. When the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah it was Rabee&#146; al-Awwal, and the\r\n    following year he fasted &#145;Aashooraa&#146; and commanded the people to fast. Then in\r\n    that year fasting in Ramadaan was made obligatory and fasting on &#145;Aashooraa&#146; was\r\n    abrogated. The scholars disputed as to whether fasting on that day (&#145;Aashooraa&#146;)\r\n    was waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (encouraged). Of the two best known opinions, the\r\n    more correct view is that it was waajib, then after that whoever fasted it did it because\r\n    it was mustahabb. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell\r\n    ordinary Muslims to fast on &#145;Aashooraa&#146;, but he used to say, &#147;This is the\r\n    day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146;; I am fasting on this day and whoever wishes to fast on this\r\n    day may fast.&#148; And he said: &#147;Fasting on &#145;Aashooraa&#146; expiates for the\r\n    sins of one year and fasting on the day of &#145;Arafaah expiates for the sins of two\r\n    years.&#148; When, towards the end of his life, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) heard that the Jews took the day of &#145;Aashooraa&#146; as a\r\n    festival, he said, &#147;If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the\r\n    ninth&#148; &#150; to be different from the Jews, and not to resemble them in taking the\r\n    day as a festival. <\/p>\r\n    <p>There were some of the Sahaabah and scholars who did not fast on this\r\n    day and did not regard it as mustahabb, but thought it makrooh to single out this day for\r\n    fasting. This was reported from a group of the Koofiyeen (scholars of Kufa). Some other\r\n    scholars said that it was mustahabb to fast on this day. The correct view is that it is\r\n    mustahabb for the one who fasts on &#145;Aashooraa&#146; to fast on the ninth day [of\r\n    Muharram] too, because this was the ultimate command of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him), as he said: &#147;If I live until next year, I will certainly fast\r\n    on the ninth as well as the tenth.&#148; This was reported with a variety of isnaads. This\r\n    is what is prescribed in the Sunnah of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him). <\/p>\r\n    <p>As for the other things, such as cooking special dishes with or without\r\n    grains, or wearing new clothes, or spending money on one&#146;s family, or buying the\r\n    year&#146;s supplies on that day, or doing special acts of worship such as special prayers\r\n    or deliberately slaughtering an animal on that day, or saving some of the meat of the\r\n    sacrifice to cook with grains, or wearing kohl and henna, or taking a bath (ghusl), or\r\n    shaking hands with one another, or visiting one another, or visiting the mosques and\r\n    mashhads (shrines) and so on&#133; all of this is reprehensible bid&#146;ah and is wrong.\r\n    None of it has anything to do with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the way of the Khulafa&#146; al-Raashidoon. It was not\r\n    approved of by any of the imaams of the Muslims, not Maalik, not al-Thawri, not al-Layth\r\n    ibn Sa&#146;d, not Abu Haneefah, not al-Oozaa&#146;i, not al-Shaafa'i, not Ahmad ibn\r\n    Hanbal, not Ishaaq ibn Raahwayh, not any of the imaams and scholars of the Muslims.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The religion of Islam is based on two principles: that we should\r\n    worship nothing besides Allaah Alone, and that we should worship Him in the manner that He\r\n    has prescribed, not by means of bid&#146;ah or reprehensible innovations. Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his\r\n    Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his\r\n    Lord.&#148; [al-Kahf 18:110].<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Righteous deeds are those which are loved by Allaah and His Messenger,\r\n    those which are prescribed in Islam and in the Sunnah.

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade \r\n    resembling the People of the Book in many ahaadeeth. For example, he said concerning &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;: &ldquo;If I live until next year I will certainly fast \r\n    the ninth.&rdquo; <i>Al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, part 6.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said, commenting on the hadeeth &ldquo;If I live until next year I will certainly fast the ninth&rdquo;:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>His concern to fast the ninth may be understood as meaning that he would not limit himself to \r\n    that, rather that he would add it to the tenth, either to be on the safe side, or to be different from the Jews and Christians, which is more \r\n    likely to be correct; this is what may be understood from some of the reports narrated by Muslim.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>From <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/245.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11204","question_id":"11204","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Praise be to Allaah for making you keen to do naafil acts of worship.

The \r\n    word &ldquo;<i>idhan<\/i>&rdquo; (translated here as &ldquo;then&rdquo;, in the sense of &ldquo;in that case&rdquo;) indicates that it is permissible to form the intention of \r\n    observing a naafil fast on the day itself. This is unlike the obligatory fasts, which are not valid unless one forms the intention the night \r\n    before, because of the hadeeth, &ldquo;Whoever does not form the intention to fast before dawn, has not fasted.&rdquo; Abu Dawood, 2454; al-Tirmidhi, 726; \r\n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 6535. What is meant here is obligatory fasts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on this, then your fast is valid. With regard to getting the reward for fasting, will \r\n    this be reward for the whole day or from the time of the intention only? Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are two scholarly opinions on this \r\n    matter. The first is that he will be rewarded from the beginning of the day, because the correct Islamic fast can only be from the start of the \r\n    day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The second view is that he will only be \r\n    rewarded from the time of his intention, and if he formed the intention at midday then he will be rewarded for half a day. This is the correct \r\n    view, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but \r\n    that which he intended.&rdquo; This man only formed the intention during the day, so he will be rewarded from the time he formed the intention.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on the correct opinion, if a fast is \r\n    connected to a particular day, such as fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and fasting on al-ayaam al-beed (the 13<sup>th<\/sup>, 14<sup>th<\/sup> and \r\n    15<sup>th<\/sup> of each Hijri month) or fasting three days each month, and a person forms the intention during the day, he will not be rewarded \r\n    for the entire day. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    6\/373.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The same applies to the case of one who did \r\n    not intend to fast &lsquo;Ashoora until after dawn had come: he will not get the reward for fasting &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, which is the expiation of one year, \r\n    because his case is not like that of one fasted the whole day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, rather he only fasted part of it, from the moment he first formed the \r\n    intention of fasting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But he will be rewarded in the general sense \r\n    of the reward for fasting during the month of Allaah Muharram, which is the best kind of fasting after Ramadaan (as it says in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, \r\n    1163).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Perhaps one of the main reasons for your and \r\n    many people&rsquo;s not knowing when &lsquo;Ashoora is, or <i>al-ayyaam al-beed<\/i>, until the day has started, is &ndash; as you mention &ndash; use of the Gregorian \r\n    calendar. Perhaps missing out on these special days will motivate you and others whom Allaah blesses with guidance, to follow the lunar Hijri \r\n    calendar which Allaah has prescribed for His slaves and approved of for His religion, even if that is only with regard to their personal dealings, \r\n    so as to revive this calendar which reminds us of different shar&rsquo;i occasions, and in order to be different from the People of the Book whom we are \r\n    commanded to differ from and be distinct with regard to their rituals and unique characteristics, especially since the lunar calendar was followed \r\n    by the earlier Prophets, as may be understood from the hadeeth which mentions the reason why the Jews fasted &lsquo;Ashoora &ndash; which is a day that is \r\n    known through the lunar calendar.

Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>No person earns \r\n    any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear \r\n    the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell \r\n    you that wherein you have been differing<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-An&lsquo;aam 6:164]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Beef that has been slaughtered properly is halaal meat \r\n    according to the consensus of the fuqaha&rsquo;, and it does not become haraam if \r\n    it reaches the country by illegal means. The prohibition [on smuggling] does \r\n    not apply to the meat itself, contrary to the case if the cow is slaughtered \r\n    in a way that is not prescribed in Islam, such as if the name of Allah is \r\n    not mentioned over it or it is slaughtered in a manner other than that used \r\n    by the Muslims. In that case its meat is haraam. As for smuggling, the \r\n    prohibition does not make the meat haraam; rather the wrongdoing in this \r\n    case is limited to breaking the law of the land.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that the people would suffer a great deal of \r\n    hardship if a fatwa were to be issued forbidding them to buy this meat is \r\n    sufficient evidence that it is permissible. According to what is mentioned \r\n    in the question, the vast majority of the meat that is sold in the \r\n    marketplaces comes from the smuggling mentioned. Moreover, there would be a \r\n    huge rise in prices if this source of meat was banned. The basic shar&lsquo;i \r\n    principle on which there is scholarly consensus says that hardship makes it \r\n    permissible to be lax in implementing shar&lsquo;i rules.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Regardless of the laws of these countries and whether they \r\n    allow the importing of cattle or not, and regardless of the extent to which \r\n    that serves the interests of the people or not, none of that has any impact \r\n    on the meat of these cattle, even if the consumer is certain that it comes \r\n    from smuggled cattle.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11208","question_id":"11208","answers":"Praise be to Allah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    First of all we would like to thank you for your frankness, \r\n    the clarity of your question and your search for an answer. We hope that you \r\n    will find the answer in these few lines we write.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We will begin our answer by posing a question, which we would \r\n    like you to answer, then after that our point will become clear, by Allah&rsquo;s \r\n    leave. Our question is: do you think that if a girl takes off all her \r\n    clothes and walks about in the markets of London or Paris completely naked, \r\n    will you accept that from her or will the authorities and laws in that place \r\n    allow her to do that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We think it most likely that your answer will be no, and that \r\n    you will not accept this idea, especially since the laws that protect public \r\n    order do not allow that at all. This is no secret to anyone who lives in \r\n    that country.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we take it to another level, we say to you: do you think \r\n    that if she wore something that covered her private parts, but it uncovered \r\n    her chest and she went shopping topless, we think that you would also agree \r\n    that such behaviour is ill-mannered and that it is disrespectful and a \r\n    transgression of public etiquette as it is known among people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Forget about those who expose themselves blatantly; what do \r\n    you think that if a woman went out in the streets and public places wearing \r\n    nightclothes&hellip;?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps you also know that the authorities in Western \r\n    countries have the right to object to those who wear swimwear in public \r\n    places, and that the manager of the company or boss in a workplace has the \r\n    right to prevent female employees from working with him wearing revealing, \r\n    provocative clothing, and it is mandatory to wear regular, modest clothing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our question now is: do you think all these countries, \r\n    people, organisations, laws and customs are vain or obsessed with sex, as \r\n    you say? Or do you think they are abhorrent and unjust, aimed at suppressing \r\n    freedom, and could not be introduced by anyone but people who are obsessed \r\n    with sex? Do you think that if a woman uncovers her chest or her private \r\n    parts or wears swimwear in public places, all men will want her or that she \r\n    is engaging in prostitution and trying to tempt them? <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you say that there is a difference between the two \r\n    scenarios, and nakedness in public places is unacceptable, but that \r\n    uncovering the hair and face is something normal and is not provocative and \r\n    does not transgress public order, we say to you: who is to decide between us \r\n    and you in defining the parts of the body that may be uncovered and the \r\n    parts that it is unacceptable to uncover? Why do you want to make us adhere \r\n    to the limits that you set, and do not want to accept the limits set out in \r\n    Islamic sharee&lsquo;ah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Furthermore, why should a particular society, such as Western \r\n    society, decide for other societies what is appropriate for them and what is \r\n    not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once you know that banning nakedness or scanty dress in \r\n    public places does not imply all the things that you mentioned in your \r\n    question, then we would tell you that we Muslims believe that modest dress \r\n    is this hijab which you see Muslim women wearing and accuse them of being \r\n    vain?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why do you look at modesty, or whatever you think is contrary \r\n    to public taste, manners and morals &ndash; why do you regard your point of view \r\n    or that of your society as the criterion for judging other societies or \r\n    people?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why do you reject our view concerning this matter, and ask us \r\n    to adhere to your concept and definition of modesty? If a girl uncovers her \r\n    thighs and stomach, is this modesty? Or should she limit it to uncovering \r\n    her legs and forearms only? What is the guideline for your choices in this \r\n    matter? What right do you have to make all of humanity adhere to your \r\n    particular concept?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or: is this a remnant of the &ldquo;right&rdquo; of the white man or, \r\n    let&rsquo;s say, the white or blonde woman, to control the world and define its \r\n    concepts, customs, manners and taste?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why do you not describe the Virgin Mary (peace be upon her) \r\n    as you have described us in your question as being &ldquo;vain&rdquo;? You know that she \r\n    wore a kind of hijab. Did she understand modesty as something sexual, \r\n    according to your description?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why do women in the church cover their hair during the \r\n    service in the church and during the prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the difference between the state of prayer and \r\n    outside prayer? If wearing the hijab during prayer increases piety and \r\n    faith, then why would a woman remove part of her faith and piety outside of \r\n    prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why do you not make the same accusation of vanity with regard \r\n    to what is mentioned in the first Epistle of the apostle Paul to the \r\n    Corinthians, in which he says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head \r\n    uncovered dishonors her head&mdash;it is the same as having her head shaved.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well \r\n    have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair \r\n    cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and \r\n    glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority \r\n    over her own head, because of the angels.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 Corinthians 11:5-10 &ndash; New International Version (NIV)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the first Epistle of Paul to Timothy, it says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and \r\n    propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or \r\n    pearls or expensive clothes, <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to \r\n    worship God.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over \r\n    a man; she must be quiet.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 Timothy 2:9-12&ndash; New International Version (NIV)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Furthermore, the face-covering (niqab) is also mentioned in \r\n    the Bible, as a sign of modesty and good manners in a woman.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the book of Genesis it says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he \r\n    looked up, he saw camels approaching. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac.

Such accusations are the easiest thing for an opponent to say, and \r\n    there is no one who is not able to refute them or respond in kind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We assure you that the obligation of hijab in Islamic \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah is not because Islam accuses every woman who does not wear hijab \r\n    of being immoral, or because all men will look at her as a focus for their \r\n    wickedness and desires. Islamic societies raise people to be righteous and \r\n    pious at all stages of upbringing, in the family and in the street, school, \r\n    mosque and at university. The fact that there are many Islamic rulings that \r\n    encourage good manners, decency, chastity and modesty is sufficient to deter \r\n    many people from committing immoral actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But Islam does not only look at the majority of people; \r\n    rather it pays attention to the fact that there is also a small percentage \r\n    of evildoers, in order to protect the well-being of the majority and so that \r\n    they will not be affected by the actions of the minority, that could spoil \r\n    life for people and spread immorality if they are not stopped, just as if \r\n    the authorities in Western countries left perverts, homosexuals and the \r\n    patrons of strip clubs to act upon their desires and preferences in the \r\n    streets or in public places, without any checks or measures &ndash; you can \r\n    imagine what the consequences would be for those societies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here we will present to you a further quotation which says \r\n    that attempts to remove women&rsquo;s niqabs (face veils) and make them uncover \r\n    their faces is the way of the evildoers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the Catholic edition of the book of Daniel, it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Now Susanna was a woman of great refinement and beautiful in \r\n    appearance. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As she was veiled, the scoundrels ordered her to be unveiled, \r\n    so that they might feast their eyes on her beauty.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Daniel 13:30-31 &ndash; New Revised Standard Edition&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    No comment!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, we invite you to read studies on safety which keep \r\n    an eye on statistics charting attacks on women, such as rape for example. \r\n    You will find terrifying numbers. According to the organization RAINN (Rape, \r\n    Abuse and Incest National Network), which is the largest American national \r\n    organisation against sexual assault, every two minutes in America there is a \r\n    sexual assault, which means that sexual assaults in one year number 207,754. \r\n    This is a huge number which requires a serious effort to unearth the causes \r\n    and look for the remedy.

Some of the \r\n    producers of these clips put with them Qur&rsquo;anic verses that speak of the \r\n    subject of the clip, either during the clip or at the end. We do not think \r\n    that there is anything wrong with doing that because it is no more than a \r\n    scene that is in harmony with the meaning of the verses, but it is important \r\n    to pay attention to a few things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The clip should not contain any \r\n    music<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The clip should not show any \r\n    women<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The topic of the clip should \r\n    not speak of matters of the unseen, because it is not appropriate to show \r\n    worldly gardens and then quote verses that mention the <\/span>\r\n    garden of Paradise; or to show huge fires and then quote the \r\n    verses that mention Hell. That is because of the difference between what is \r\n    in this world and what is in the Hereafter, as they have nothing in common \r\n    but names.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with showing clips of things mentioned \r\n    in the Qur&rsquo;anic verses that are not different from and are in harmony with \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;anic verse. An example of that is what the questioner mentioned \r\n    about showing clips of the sea and its waves, then quoting the verses that \r\n    speak of that. Another example is showing mountains, rivers, the sun, the \r\n    moon, ships, animals, the stages of development in the foetus, and other \r\n    things in which the meanings of the verse match what is shown to the viewer. \r\n    If a video clip of camels is shown, including features of their creation, \r\n    then the clip includes the verse (interpretation of the meaning), <i>\r\n    &ldquo;<span>Do they not look at \r\n    the camels, how they are created?<\/span>&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Ghaashiyah 88:17]<\/i>, that would be in accordance \r\n    with the meaning of the Qur&rsquo;anic verse. These worldly things that are shown \r\n    in the clip are exactly what is mentioned in the verses. Similarly, if the \r\n    clip is about honouring parents and sponsoring orphans, then it quotes the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;anic verses that mention that, there is nothing wrong with this, in sha \r\n    Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatout]131472[\\fatout]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11210","question_id":"11210","answers":"Praise be to Allah<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    This transaction may take three forms:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your father buys the product for himself from the \r\n    Malaysian company, then sells it to customers in Pakistan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing dubious in this trade, and whatever he makes \r\n    of profit is his to keep; it has nothing to do with the price for which the \r\n    Malaysian company sold it.

With regard to their urinating, that \r\n    was not in the mosque; rather the coming and going was inside the mosque, \r\n    but urinating did not happen inside the mosque. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) referred to this in his commentary on <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Bukhaari<\/i>, i.e., <i>al-Fath<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if we assume that what is meant is that coming and going \r\n    and urinating all happened in the mosque, then we may say that with regard \r\n    to urinating inside the mosque, one of the following two scenarios must \r\n    apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Either the dogs urinated and \r\n    the people were aware of where it happened, in which case there is no \r\n    confusion concerning it, and this strengthens the view that dogs are not \r\n    impure, if it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) and the Sahaabah knew where it was and prayed in the place where \r\n    the dogs had urinated.

This proves that the later development \r\n    was the Prophet&rsquo;s paying attention to the mosque. We may also note that the \r\n    hadeeths that enjoin washing vessels if licked by a dog, were narrated by \r\n    Abu Hurayrah and &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Maghfal (may Allah be pleased with them, who \r\n    both became Muslim later on). Based on that, the scholars said that what is \r\n    narrated in the hadeeth (about dogs coming and going in the mosque) occurred \r\n    earlier on, and the instructions to wash vessels if licked by a dog is what \r\n    came later.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that we should follow the later \r\n    report, which abrogates the previous report.

But before Fajr prayer \r\n    there is no time when prayer is not allowed, but it is not prescribed to do \r\n    anything at that time except offer the two (Sunnah) rak&lsquo;ahs of Fajr, because \r\n    this is what was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) and there is no report to suggest that he offered any voluntary \r\n    prayer other than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: But \r\n    the correct view is that the prohibition has to do with Fajr prayer itself. \r\n    As for the time between the adhaan and iqaamah, it is not included in the \r\n    prohibition, however it is not prescribed to offer anything in that time \r\n    apart from the two (Sunnah) rak&lsquo;ahs of Fajr. If this is the correct view, \r\n    then what is the response concerning the hadeeth that is quoted as evidence \r\n    by the author?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The response to that notes two things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the hadeeth is da&lsquo;eef \r\n    (weak)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>|Even if we assume that the \r\n    hadeeth is saheeh, the words &ldquo;There is no prayer after the break of dawn&rdquo; \r\n    may be understood as meaning that it is not prescribed for a person to offer \r\n    any naafil or voluntary prayer other than the two (Sunnah) rak&lsquo;ahs of Fajr \r\n    after the break of dawn, and that is true, because it is not appropriate \r\n    for&nbsp; a person, after the break of dawn, to offer any voluntary prayer except \r\n    the two Sunnah rak&lsquo;ahs of Fajr. So if you enter the mosque and pray the two \r\n    (Sunnah) rak&lsquo;ahs of Fajr, and the time for the (fard) prayer has not yet \r\n    come, and you say, I shall offer a naafil prayer, we would say to you: Do \r\n    not do that, because this is not prescribed; but if you were to do it, you \r\n    would not be sinning. Rather we say that it is not prescribed, because the \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only prayed two brief \r\n    rak&lsquo;ahs after the break of dawn, and that is the Sunnah of Fajr prayer only. \r\n    Moreover, even making the two rak&lsquo;ahs lengthy is not prescribed.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote&nbsp; from <i>ash-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i>, 4\/51&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Note: al-Bayhaqi narrated with a saheeh isnaad from Sa&lsquo;eed \r\n    ibn al-Musayyab that he saw a man praying more than two rak&lsquo;ahs after dawn \r\n    broke, bowing and prostrating a great deal, and he told him not to do that. \r\n    The man said: O Abu Muhammad, will Allah punish me for praying? He said: No, \r\n    but He will punish you for going against the Sunnah. This is an example of \r\n    the brilliant answers of Sa&lsquo;eed ibn al-Musayyab (may Allah have mercy on \r\n    him), and it is a powerful weapon against the innovators who think many \r\n    innovations are good on the grounds that they are dhikr (remembrance of \r\n    Allah) and prayer, then they criticize Ahl as-Sunnah for criticising their \r\n    actions and accuse them of forbidding dhikr and prayer!, When in fact they \r\n    are only criticizing their going against the Sunnah with regard to dhikr and \r\n    prayer and so on.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Irwa&rsquo; al-Ghaleel<\/i>, 2\/236.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11221","question_id":"11221","answers":"Praise be to Allah<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for you to leave your son to be easy \r\n    prey for the disbelievers. You have to do your utmost to take him away from \r\n    his mother and her country, so that he can live with you in your country. \r\n    This is your right according to sharee&lsquo;ah, and he should follow you in your \r\n    religion and be in your custody; that apostate woman has no right to him. If \r\n    you can give them money to let the boy be with you, then do so; if you can \r\n    refer the matter to their courts so that he can be in your custody, then do \r\n    so. In all of these matters, you should consult Islamic centres whose staff \r\n    you trust in that country, and consult trustworthy lawyers. If you can find \r\n    a suitable way to take him and bring him to your country, then do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your attempts to keep your son with you now do not \r\n    succeed, but the law will allow you to have custody of him within a short \r\n    period of time, then there is nothing wrong with staying there for the \r\n    duration, so that you can be near him and in constant contact with him, \r\n    until you are able to have custody of him. At the very least, you can \r\n    frequently visit that country in order to see him and take care of him as \r\n    much as you can, within time constraints. Perhaps your frequent visits will \r\n    be a cause of his mother coming back to Islam and being saved from eternity \r\n    in the Fire, and it may be a cause of your son bonding with you and loving \r\n    Islam. At the same time you should do whatever you can to make sure that he \r\n    is in a clean environment, whether in the place where he is living or in \r\n    school. We know how difficult that is, but whoever fears Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, is sincere in his intention and does his utmost, there is the hope \r\n    that the difficulties will be reduced for him and his good wishes will be \r\n    fulfilled.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your staying in France will increase the likelihood of \r\n    your son being with you and keeping his religion, and that his apostate \r\n    mother will not make him into a Christian or turn him away from your \r\n    religion, then stay close to him until you are able to take custody of him, \r\n    as mentioned above. If you think that there is no benefit in your staying \r\n    there, and that you will never be able to take custody of him within a short \r\n    period of time, then what we think is that you should move to your country \r\n    Morocco, and start a new life there, but that is on condition that you can \r\n    frequently visit the place where your son lives, as we mentioned above.

How many there will be among these volunteers who do not \r\n    recite Qur&rsquo;an well or do not understand its meanings! Based on that, this is \r\n    the first problem with what these people are doing of asking volunteers to \r\n    perform ruqyah for the sick. Most of them may not be qualified for that, and \r\n    they (the organizers) will not have fulfilled the conditions that must be \r\n    met by the raaqi (the one who performs ruqyah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]7874[\\fatin]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no basis in Islam for reciting ruqyah in a group, as \r\n    far as we know, whether that is done by reciting it in unison or repeating \r\n    it after one of them. This is not the way to perform ruqyah. What is \r\n    normally done with regard to ruqyah is that it is done by one person who \r\n    recites over the sick person the ruqyah that is Islamically prescribed; \r\n    there is no reason why someone else should not help him if he becomes tired \r\n    or he stops, so that the other person may perform ruqyah for the sick person \r\n    after him. But with regard to more than one person reciting in unison or \r\n    repeating after a reciter or raaqi, this is something for which there is no \r\n    basis in Islam, as stated above, and it does not come under the heading of \r\n    treating the sick with ruqyah. With regard to recitation of the Islamically \r\n    prescribed ruqyah by a particular reciter or raaqi over water, which is then \r\n    used to wash the sick person or given to him to drink, that is permissible. \r\n    We have discussed this in the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]96793[\\fatin]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Recitation of Qur&rsquo;an on the occasion mentioned (in the \r\n    question) and similar occasions is something for which there is no basis in \r\n    the Sunnah, whether that is recitation of a random passage from the Qur&rsquo;an \r\n    or recitation of al-Faatihah in particular on some occasion, because the \r\n    basic principle with regard to acts of worship is that they are based on \r\n    tawqeef <span>[i.e., they can only be \r\n    known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadeeth, with no room for \r\n    ijtihaad]<\/span>. There were (among the early \r\n    generation) occasions such as divorce, marriage and so on, during which not \r\n    a single letter of the Qur&rsquo;an, al-Faatihah or anything else, was recited by \r\n    the people present. All goodness is in following the earlier generations and \r\n    all evil is in following innovations introduced by those who came after \r\n    them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    al-Faatihah and other specific soorahs are only to be recited in the cases \r\n    prescribed by Islam. If they are recited in other cases as an act of \r\n    worship, then this is regarded as an innovation. We have seen many people \r\n    reciting al-Faatihah on all occasions; we have even heard people saying, \r\n    &ldquo;Recite al-Faatihah for the deceased&rdquo; or &ldquo;for such and such&rdquo; and so on. All \r\n    of this comes under the heading of reprehensible innovations. Al-Faatihah \r\n    and other soorahs are not to be recited in all situations, in all places and \r\n    at all times, and we should object to the one who does that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala ad-Darb<\/i>, tape no. \r\n    371&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatout]147645[\\fatout]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Mixing of men and women is haraam and reprehensible; the \r\n    prohibition is more emphatic and the abhorrent nature of the act is greater \r\n    if that mixing takes place in one of the houses of Allah and is done openly \r\n    and attributed to Islam!

Among these reasons, he mentioned: \r\n    &ldquo;He causes him to forget his own acts of obedience and makes him focus on \r\n    his sin, so that it continues to preoccupy his mind. For when Allah wills \r\n    good for a person, He makes his good deeds invisible to him and diverts him \r\n    from mentioning them, and He distracts him by causing him to focus on his \r\n    sin, so that he is always thinking of them, until he enters Paradise. So he \r\n    does not think of his deeds that are already accepted, and he does not \r\n    mention them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the salaf (early generation) said: A person may commit \r\n    a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do a righteous deed and \r\n    enter Hell because of it. They said: How is that? He said: He commits a sin \r\n    then keeps thinking of it, and when he remembers that he regrets it, feels \r\n    sorry, beseeches Allah, hastens to erase it and feels brokenhearted and \r\n    humble before his Lord, and that removes self admiration and pride from him. \r\n    Or he may do a good deed then keep thinking of it, talking about it, feeling \r\n    proud of it and feeling arrogant because of it, until he enters Hell.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Tareeq al-Hijratayn<\/i>, p. 169-172&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant is that by His wisdom, Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, may decree sin for His slave and let him commit a sin &ndash; even though \r\n    He hates sin and the act of committing it, and He forbids it and warns of \r\n    punishment for it &ndash; so that the person will forget about his good deeds and \r\n    acts of obedience to Allah; thus his Lord protects him from self-admiration, \r\n    showing off and arrogance. Then He preoccupies his mind by making him focus \r\n    on his sin and the bad situation he is in, because his Lord saw him where He \r\n    forbade him to be, and thus he exposed himself to the wrath and punishment \r\n    of Allah. He was alarmed because of this situation he found himself in, thus \r\n    he was stricken with fear of His vengeance and punishment, which prevents \r\n    him from falling into sin again and encourages him to obey his Lord and feel \r\n    shy before Him. And that continues, with him feeling afraid and nervous, \r\n    until Allah admits him to Paradise by His mercy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, does not admit him to Paradise by \r\n    means of the sin he committed; rather He admits him to Paradise by His mercy \r\n    as a reward for what resulted from his committing that sin of fear (of \r\n    Allah) and worry (about the punishment).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Na&lsquo;eem narrated in <i>al-Hilyah<\/i> (6\/98) from Shaddaad \r\n    ibn Aws that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said: &lsquo;By My Glory, I \r\n    will not cause My slave to feel secure in two situations or feel afraid in \r\n    two situations. If he feels secure in this world, I shall make him feel \r\n    afraid on the Day when I gather My slaves together. And if he fears Me in \r\n    this world, I shall make him feel secure on the Day when I gather My slaves \r\n    together.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>as-Saheehah<\/i>, 742&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that Allah may decree that a person should \r\n    commit sin because of what He wills for him of good in the form of \r\n    repentance, fear (of Allah), returning to Him, humbling himself and giving \r\n    up self-admiration, then turning to Allah, as happened in the case of &lsquo;Umar \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez (may Allah have mercy on him). When he was the governor \r\n    of Madinah, he gave Khubayb ibn &lsquo;Abdillah ibn az-Zubayr fifty lashes and \r\n    poured water on him on a very cold winter&rsquo;s day, which led to his death. \r\n    Then he regretted that deeply and it continued to affect him for the rest of \r\n    his life. That sin resulted in him becoming humble, fearing Allah, \r\n    regretting it, regarding the sin as significant and regarding as little what \r\n    he did of good deeds that led him to attain the high status that he \r\n    subsequently attained.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez gave Khubayb ibn &lsquo;Abdillah ibn \r\n    az-Zubayr fifty lashes on the orders of al-Waleed, and he poured cold water \r\n    over his head on a cold winter&rsquo;s day, and make him stand at the door of the \r\n    mosque for that day, then he died (may Allah have mercy on him). After the \r\n    death of Khubayb, &lsquo;Umar ibn &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez was very afraid and did not feel \r\n    safe. If he was given any glad tidings with regard to the Hereafter, he \r\n    would say: How could I attain that when Khubayb is standing in my way?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to another report he used to say: That is if \r\n    Khubayb is not standing in the way, then he would weep like a woman who has \r\n    lost her child.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If someone praised him, he would say: How bad is what I did \r\n    to Khubayb! If I am saved from that sin, then I shall be fine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He remained governor of Madinah until he had Khubayb flogged \r\n    and he died as a result, then he resigned and immersed himself in grief and \r\n    fear from that time, and he began to strive hard in worship and weeping. \r\n    That (the beating of Khubayb) was a mistake on his part, but because of it \r\n    he attained a great deal of good, namely his worship, weeping, grief, fear, \r\n    kindness, justice, charity, righteousness, freeing slaves and so on.

The answer is: No; rather it is a celebration of &lsquo;Eesa as \r\n    &ldquo;God&rdquo; or the &ldquo;son of God&rdquo;! Exalted be Allah far above what they say.

They even narrated from Ja&lsquo;far \r\n    as-Saadiq that he said: &ldquo;Taqiyyah is my religion and the religion of my \r\n    forefathers.&rdquo; But taqiyyah is one of the signs of hypocrisy; in fact in \r\n    their case, they say verbally that which is not in their hearts, and this is \r\n    the essence of hypocrisy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, \r\n    13\/263&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He also said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>As for the Raafidis, the basis of their \r\n    innovation is heresy and the deliberate lying that is widespread among them. \r\n    They affirmed that when they said: Our religion is taqiyyah.

But now Allah has caused the Muslims to prevail so \r\n    there is no need for taqiyyah. But the taqiyyah of the Shi&lsquo;ah is practised \r\n    with the Muslims, especially Ahl as-Sunnah, to the extent that they think \r\n    that the best of eras was the era of taqiyyah, as was stated by their shaykh \r\n    al-Mufeed. This may also be noted in the texts that they attribute to the \r\n    imams, because they regard Ahl as-Sunnah as being worse in disbelief than \r\n    the Jews and Christians, because the one who rejects the twelve Imams is \r\n    worse than one who rejects Prophethood.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Taqiyyah &ndash; according to Ahl as-Sunnah &ndash; is \r\n    a concession to be used in times of necessity, hence Allah &ndash; may He be \r\n    glorified &ndash; exempted it from the principle that prohibits taking the \r\n    disbelievers as supporters and helpers. Allah, may He be glorified, says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;Let not the believers take the \r\n    disbelievers as Awliya (supporters, helpers, etc.) instead of the believers, \r\n    and whoever does that will never be helped by Allah in any way, except if \r\n    you indeed fear a danger from them.

Then He, may He be glorified, says: &ldquo;<i>except if you indeed fear a \r\n    danger from them<\/i>&rdquo; i.e., except for those who, in some countries or at \r\n    some times, may fear their evil; in that case he may protect himself from \r\n    them by his outward words and actions, not by his inward beliefs and \r\n    intentions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The scholars are unanimously agreed that \r\n    taqiyyah is a concession that is allowed in the case of necessity. Ibn al-Mundhir \r\n    said: They are unanimously agreed that if a person is forced to say words of \r\n    disbelief, to the extent that he fears for his life, and he speaks words of \r\n    disbelief when his heart is content with faith, he is not to be deemed a \r\n    disbeliever.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>But the one who chooses to be steadfast in \r\n    this situation is better.

But \r\n    if her &lsquo;iddah comes to an end, she may then marry anyone she wishes, or if \r\n    she wants, she can wait and if he does become Muslim, then she is still his \r\n    wife, with no need for a new marriage contract.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, 5\/137&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, \r\n    and is the view regarded as most correct by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on them both).

He waited until he thought that I had gone to sleep, then he picked up \r\n    his cloak slowly, put on his shoes slowly, opened the door slowly, and went \r\n    out, then he closed it slowly. I put my chemise over my head and veiled \r\n    myself, and wrapped my waist wrapper around me, then I set out following \r\n    him, until he reached al-Baqee&lsquo; where he stood for a long time, then he \r\n    raised his hands three times. Then he set off, so I set off, then he \r\n    hastened, so I hastened, then he jogged, so I jogged, then he ran so I ran, \r\n    then I reached home before him and went in. No sooner had I laid down but he \r\n    came in and said: &ldquo;What is the matter, O &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah? Why are you out of \r\n    breath?&rdquo; I said: It is nothing. He said: &ldquo;Either you tell me or the Subtle \r\n    One, the All-Aware will tell me.&rdquo; I said: O Messenger of Allah, may my \r\n    father and mother be sacrificed for you! And I told him. He said: &ldquo;So you \r\n    were the person that I saw in front of me?&rdquo; I said: Yes. He gave me a \r\n    painful shove on the chest, then he said: &ldquo;Did you think that Allah and His \r\n    Messenger would be unjust to you?&rdquo; She said: Whatever the people conceal, \r\n    Allah knows it; yes. He said: &ldquo;Jibreel came to me when you saw. He called me \r\n    but he concealed it from you, and I answered him but I concealed it from \r\n    you. He would not enter upon you when you were not fully dressed. I thought \r\n    that you had gone to sleep and I did not want to wake you up, and I was \r\n    afraid that you might be frightened.

In fact it is stated in <i>Lisaan al-&lsquo;Arab<\/i> \r\n    (3\/393) that one of the meanings of the word lahd (translated here as shove) \r\n    is poke. In <i>Taaj al-&lsquo;Aroos<\/i> (9\/145) it says that one of the meanings \r\n    of the word lahd is to apply pressure.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>All of these \r\n    meanings indicate that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) did not hit her in the sense meant by those who want to cast aspersions \r\n    upon him; rather he poked her or pushed her in the chest in such a way that \r\n    she felt pain, but it was mild and unintended pain; rather the purpose \r\n    behind it was to point out something and teach.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If the reader \r\n    reflects on this hadeeth he will realise that it is one of the proofs of the \r\n    greatness of the Prophet&rsquo;s attitude. A man may live with his wife for many \r\n    years, and she may do many things because of the jealousy that is an \r\n    inherent part of women&rsquo;s character, but he (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) is not known to have ever caused her harm in word or deed, except \r\n    for what is mentioned in this hadeeth, despite the large number of narrators \r\n    who transmitted all the details of his life (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him). This is indicative of his perfect character (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>As for those \r\n    haters who seek to cast aspersions upon him, they wish that they could find \r\n    any suggestion that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) hit his \r\n    wife in such a way that it caused pain, or at least that he hit her in a way \r\n    that hurt her, by way of rebuking and humiliation. But they failed to do so. \r\n    The most that is mentioned in this hadeeth is that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her) said: He gave me a painful shove in the chest. The one who \r\n    wants to hit and humiliate someone will not limit it to a shove in the \r\n    chest; rather he will focus his energies on the sides of the body or the \r\n    face, and have a humiliating impact on the mind of the one whom he hits. We \r\n    do not see anything of that nature in the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This hadeeth is \r\n    indicative of the perfect character of the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) and of his compassion and tenderheartedness, because he \r\n    did not rebuke or strike or tell off; rather he chided her gently with the \r\n    aim of teaching &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and the ummah \r\n    after her. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and His Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do not treat anyone unjustly, and \r\n    it is not permissible for anyone to think negatively of Allah or His \r\n    Messenger. Rather what is required of others is to think positively of Allah \r\n    and to accept whatever Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, decrees. That \r\n    &ldquo;shove&rdquo; was one of the means of teaching and highlighting a matter of great \r\n    importance that it is not appropriate to forget or neglect, no matter how \r\n    great her jealousy concerning the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) and her love for him. It is not appropriate for it to be thought \r\n    that the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would \r\n    wrong any of his wives for the sake of another, Allah forbid.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Another indication \r\n    that this &ldquo;shove&rdquo; was not by way of beating and causing pain; rather it was \r\n    by way of teaching and pointing out something, is the rest of the \r\n    conversation between the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). It was a peaceful and \r\n    beneficial discussion in which the compassion of the greatest teacher \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was manifested, as he explained \r\n    to her the reason why he had gone out of the house at that late hour. He \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had opened the door quietly and \r\n    left the house without a sound so as not to disturb her sleep. Such an \r\n    explanation could not stem from anger or the aim of causing pain; rather it \r\n    came from a compassionate, kind and noble husband who respected his wife and \r\n    explained to her, telling her the details of what had happened with him, so \r\n    as to share his story with her. Thus he instilled in her heart a sense of \r\n    confidence and trust in her honest and sincere husband.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>She said: Whatever \r\n    the people conceal, Allah knows it; yes. He said: &ldquo;Jibreel came to me when \r\n    you saw. He called me but he concealed it from you, and I answered him but I \r\n    concealed it from you. He would not enter upon you when you were not fully \r\n    dressed. I thought that you had gone to sleep and I did not want to wake you \r\n    up, and I was afraid that you might be frightened. He said: &ldquo;Your Lord is \r\n    commanding you to go to the people of al-Baqee&rsquo; and pray for forgiveness for \r\n    them.&rdquo; I said:&nbsp; What should I say to them, O Messenger of Allah? He said: \r\n    &ldquo;Say: Peace be upon the people of these abodes, believers and Muslims. May \r\n    Allah have mercy on those of us who have gone on before and those who come \r\n    later, and we will &ndash; if Allah wills &ndash; join you soon.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Let the one who \r\n    honestly and sincerely seeks the truth reflect on the story of a husband to \r\n    whom an important matter came when he was sleeping in his wife&rsquo;s bed at \r\n    night. He wanted to go out and leave her, but he did not want to wake her up \r\n    or disturb her sleep; he also did not want her to wake up and feel lonely, \r\n    anxious and afraid that she had suddenly lost her husband who had been by \r\n    her side.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If we were to \r\n    quote all the hadeeths that highlight the forbearance of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with his wives, it would take a \r\n    long time. He was forbearing and compassionate in situations where an \r\n    ordinary husband might lose his cool. But the one who had this great \r\n    character (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was patient and \r\n    forbearing; indeed he refrained from doing anything that could upset his \r\n    wife.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Another example of \r\n    that is seen in the report narrated by Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with her), which says that she brought some food in a dish of hers to the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon her) and his \r\n    companions, then &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah came, wrapped up in a garment, with a stone \r\n    pestle and broke the dish. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) gathered the broken pieces of the dish and said: &ldquo;Eat; your mother got \r\n    jealous,&rdquo; twice. Then the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) took the dish of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and sent it to Umm Salamah and he \r\n    gave the dish of Umm Salamah to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Narrated by \r\n    an-Nasaa&rsquo;i in <i>as-Sunan<\/i>, 3956; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\r\n    <i>Saheeh an-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It was narrated \r\n    that Nu&lsquo;maan ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him) said:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Abu Bakr came and \r\n    asked permission to enter upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him), and he heard &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah raising her voice to the Messenger of \r\n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He gave him permission to \r\n    enter, so he entered and said: O daughter of Umm Roomaan! &ndash; and he grabbed \r\n    her &ndash; do you raise your voice to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him)? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) separated them, and when Abu Bakr left, the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) started saying to her, to make her feel happy: \r\n    &ldquo;Do you not see how I intervened between the man and you?&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He said: Then Abu \r\n    Bakr came and asked for permission to enter upon him, and he found him \r\n    laughing with her.

There are two opinions, the more correct of which is that it is \r\n    counted, so the sacrifice is done on the sixth day after (the day of \r\n    birth).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second view is that it is not counted, so the sacrifice \r\n    is done on the seventh day after (the day of birth). This is what is stated \r\n    in al-Buwayti, but the first view is the apparent meaning of the hadeeths. \r\n    If the child is born at night, the day that follows that night is included, \r\n    and there is no difference of opinion on this point.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Majmoo&lsquo;<\/i>, 8\/411&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (30\/279) it says: The \r\n    majority of fuqaha&rsquo; are of the view that the day of birth is counted as one \r\n    of the seven, but the night is not counted if the infant is born at night; \r\n    rather the day that follows that night is counted.

So if the child was born on \r\n    Saturday, the sacrifice is to be done on Friday, i.e., one day before the \r\n    day on which the child was born. This is the basic guideline. If the child \r\n    was born on Thursday, then (the &lsquo;aqeeqah) should be on Wednesday.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>ash-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i>, 7\/493&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What was said about the day of birth not being counted if the \r\n    child is born after midday was stated by a number of scholars (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on them).

However the Maalikis stipulated that the thing that enters the body \r\n    should be in liquid form, but none of the other (fuqaha&rsquo;) made any such \r\n    stipulation.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to a lesser known view of the Maalikis, which is \r\n    also the view of al-Qaadi Husayn among the Shaafa&lsquo;is &ndash; which was described \r\n    as odd (shaadhdh) &ndash; and is also the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah, if the \r\n    fasting person has an enema, it does not invalidate the fast and he does not \r\n    have to make it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They gave as the reason for that the fact that fasting is \r\n    part of the Muslims&rsquo; religion which both scholars and ordinary people need \r\n    to know about.

But there are some reports which \r\n    indicate that some of the Sahaabah used to offer it earlier, before the \r\n    meridian. As there is the excuse of being busy at the usual time for this \r\n    prayer, we say that there is nothing wrong with offering it before the sun \r\n    passes the meridian meridian, even if it is an hour or so before, because \r\n    that is permissible according to many of the scholars and because there is \r\n    justification for bringing it forward. Based on that, there is nothing wrong \r\n    with them all praying at the time mentioned, even though the excuse applies \r\n    only to some of them and not others. And Allah knows best. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from the Shaykh&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are some khateebs who enter the mosque on Friday and \r\n    begin the khutbah before the time for the prayer; sometimes the prayer \r\n    begins when the sun has not yet passed the meridian.

This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). Others said: rather he should pray \r\n    six rak&lsquo;ahs, so as to reconcile between the two hadeeths. This was narrated \r\n    from Imam Ahmad, and was also the view of some of the early generations, \r\n    such as Sufyaan ath-Thawri, &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; and Mujaahid. Yet others said: rather he \r\n    should pray four rak&lsquo;ahs after Jumu&lsquo;ah in all cases, whether he prays in the \r\n    mosque or at home, because this was clearly stated by the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him). His praying two rak&lsquo;ahs was his practice, \r\n    and his practice does not contradict his words, because this may be \r\n    understood in several ways. In my view, this opinion is more sound, that the \r\n    regular Sunnah prayer after Jumu&lsquo;ah in all cases is four rak&lsquo;ahs. Hence when \r\n    a person has prayed Jumu&lsquo;ah, he should pray four rak&lsquo;ahs after that, whether \r\n    he is travelling or not, and whether he prays them in the mosque or home. In \r\n    that case, Friday is exempted from the general meaning of the hadeeth, \r\n    &ldquo;There is no Muslim slave who prays twelve rak&lsquo;ahs to Allaah each day, \r\n    voluntarily, apart from the obligatory prayers, but Allah will build for him \r\n    a house in Paradise.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 728).

It says in <i>I&lsquo;aanah at-Taalibeen<\/i> (4\/250) by \r\n    ad-Dimyaati ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i: What is preferable for the one who is suffering \r\n    from compulsive thoughts is to avail himself of lighter options and \r\n    concessions, so that his problem will not be exacerbated, which could lead \r\n    to him going beyond the limits set by sharee&lsquo;ah because of this compulsive \r\n    thinking. For example, a person may be affected with compulsive thoughts \r\n    that make him always doubt whether he formed the intention to do wudoo&rsquo; or \r\n    whether he recited al-Faatihah behind the imam or not, so he begins to spend \r\n    more time in wudoo&rsquo; or prayer. In that case he may forego forming the niyyah \r\n    (intention), and follow Imam Abu Haneefah with regard to this matter, \r\n    because in Abu Haneefah&rsquo;s view the niyyah is Sunnah; and he may follow his \r\n    opinion in foregoing recitation of al-Faatihah when praying behind the imam, \r\n    until the compulsive thoughts cease.

Until you are able to do that, you must keep away from movies \r\n    completely, lower your gaze, and refrain from this secret habit.

The one who suffers from it can hardly \r\n    give it up and has no limit at which he can stop. With regard to fasting, it \r\n    is a beneficial prophetic remedy, but it needs to be done regularly and on \r\n    an ongoing basis, whilst also following other preventative measures such as \r\n    lowering the gaze, avoiding idleness, keeping busy with acts of worship and \r\n    obedience, and choosing righteous friends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some fuqaha&rsquo; allowed masturbation in cases where the \r\n    individual fears for his religious commitment or physical well-being, under \r\n    the heading of committing the lesser of two evils.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked about a man who was faced with provocation of desire, so he \r\n    masturbated although he knew that the problem could be dealt with by \r\n    fasting, but it was too difficult for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to that (semen) that is emitted involuntarily, \r\n    there is no sin on him for that, but he has to do ghusl if the water came \r\n    out gushing.

It is also one of the two views \r\n    narrated from Ahmad; in fact it is the more correct view; according to \r\n    another view it is makrooh (disliked). But if he is compelled to do that, \r\n    such as if he feared that he might fall into zina if he did not masturbate, \r\n    or he feared that he might become ill, then in this case there are two \r\n    well-known scholarly views.

Needs are of two types: religious or spiritual needs and physical \r\n    needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to religious or spiritual needs, that refers to \r\n    when the individual fears that he may fall into zina, if he is in a country \r\n    where it is easy to commit zina. If he experiences intense desire, he will \r\n    have two options: either he can extinguish it by doing this action or he can \r\n    go to any place where there are prostitutes and commit zina. In that case we \r\n    say to him that this is a legitimate need, because the established principle \r\n    in Islam says that it is essential to ward off the greater of two evils by \r\n    means of the lesser, and this is what is in accordance with reason. If this \r\n    person has no option but to fulfil his desire in one of these two ways, then \r\n    in that case we say that it is permissible for him to do this action because \r\n    it is a case of necessity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to physical needs, that refers to when the \r\n    individual fears that some harm may befall his body if he does not discharge \r\n    this fluid from his body, because some people may experience strong desire, \r\n    and if this accumulating fluid is not discharged it will result in \r\n    psychological problems, so he will not like to mix with people or sit with \r\n    them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if he fears some kind of physical harm, then it is \r\n    permissible for him to do this action because it is a physical need. But if \r\n    there is no need and he does this action, then he should be given a \r\n    disciplinary punishment that will serve as a deterrent.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>ash-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i>, 14\/318&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should avoid anything that may provoke desire of looking, \r\n    listening, reading and so on, and you should avoid keeping company with \r\n    those whose company may lead to that, so as to protect your religious \r\n    commitment and your physical well-being.

This is something for which there is good \r\n    reason, as it was not known what status this newborn would achieve; his \r\n    situation was like that of any other newborn.

When Allah decreed that the \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should begin to convey \r\n    His message forty years after he was born, people began to seek out whatever \r\n    memories they had about this Prophet, and they asked one another about every \r\n    detail of his life. They were helped in that by what the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) himself narrated about incidents \r\n    that he had experienced from his birth, as well as the reports narrated by \r\n    his Companions and those who had also gone through those events with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>At that time the Muslims began \r\n    to collect everything that they had heard about the life story of their \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in order to transmit it \r\n    to the people down throughout the ages&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Al-Qawl al-Mubeen fi Seerat \r\n    Sayyid al-Mursaleen<\/i>, p. 78&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the matters on which \r\n    there is consensus with regard to his birth (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) is the definition of the year and the day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    With regard to the year:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was the Year of the \r\n    Elephant.

Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr narrated that the \r\n    historians regarded it as saheeh; it was stated definitively by al-Haafiz \r\n    al-Kabeer Muhammad ibn Moosa al-Khawaarizmi, and was regarded as most likely \r\n    to be correct by al-Haafiz Abu&rsquo;l-Khattaan ibn Dihyah in his book <i>\r\n    at-Tanweer fi Mawlid al-Basheer an-Nadheer<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As-Seerah an-Nabawiyyah, 1\/199&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    It was said that he was born on \r\n    10<sup>th<\/sup> Rabee &lsquo; al-Awwal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Katheer (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was said that he was born on \r\n    the tenth of the month.

Some Muslim mathematicians and \r\n    astronomers have determined that the Monday in question was the ninth of \r\n    Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal.

They were: Ibn Shihaab az-Zuhri and Abu \r\n    Hamzah Maymoon, the freed slave of &lsquo;Urwah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he named those who narrated it from Hishaam ibn &lsquo;Urwah \r\n    among the scholars of Madinah. The reader should understand that this \r\n    hadeeth is one of those that were also narrated by Hishaam in Madinah. They \r\n    were: Abu&rsquo;z-Zinnaad &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Dhakwaan and his son &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn \r\n    Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad, and &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn &lsquo;Urwah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the people of Makkah (it was narrated by) Sufyaan ibn &lsquo;Uyaynah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (It was also narrated by) Jareer ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Hameed ad-Dubbi \r\n    among the people of ar-Rayy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the people of Basra (it was narrated by): Hammaad ibn \r\n    Salamah, Hammaad ibn Zayd, Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See the lecture given by Shaykh Abu Ishaaq al-Huwayni (may \r\n    Allah preserve him) discussing the ignorance of the one who wrote the \r\n    article mentioned in the question, and the response to it, on the following \r\n    link (in Arabic):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    \r\n    <a>\r\n    http:\/\/www.islamway.com\/?iw_s=Lesson&amp;iw_a=view&amp;lesson_id=86106<\/a><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;See \r\n    also the following link (in Arabic):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <a>\r\n    \r\n    http:\/\/www.islamway.com\/?iw_s=Lesson&amp;iw_a=view&amp;lesson_id=86495<\/a><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of these lists are mentioned in order to ward off the \r\n    specious argument of some ignorant people who say that Hishaam ibn &lsquo;Urwah \r\n    was the only one who narrated it. Even if we accept [?} that Hishaam became \r\n    confused at the end of his life, the correct view is that this accusation \r\n    was made only by Abu&rsquo;l-Hasan ibn al-Qattaan in <i>Bayaan al-Wahm wa&rsquo;l-Eehaam<\/i>, \r\n    and he was mistaken in doing so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hishaam ibn &lsquo;Urwah was one of the prominent and authoritative \r\n    scholars, but when he grew old his memory failed, although he did not get \r\n    confused, and there is nothing valid in the view of Abu&rsquo;l-Hasan ibn \r\n    al-Qattaan, which suggests that he and Suhayl ibn Abi Saalih became confused \r\n    and changed. Yes, the man changed a little and his memory was not as sound \r\n    as it had been in his youth. He forgot some of the things he had memorized \r\n    and he made some mistakes, but so what?! He was not infallible. When he came \r\n    to Iraq at the end of his life he passed on a great deal of knowledge, among \r\n    which were a few hadeeths that he did not remember well. Something similar \r\n    happened to Maalik, Shu&lsquo;bah, Wakee&lsquo; and other senior, trustworthy narrators. \r\n    So forget about this nonsense and mixing trustworthy scholars with weak \r\n    narrators and those who became confused. Hishaam was Shaykh al-Islam, and \r\n    may Allah help us against what Ibn al-Qattaan suggested and what&nbsp; &lsquo;Abd \r\n    ar-Rahmaan ibn Kharaash said:&nbsp; Maalik did not approve of him because he got \r\n    angry with him for going and narrating hadeeth in Iraq.

Among those \r\n    who were her contemporaries and knew her better than others were the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ahmad narrated in <i>al-Musnad<\/i>, 6\/112 from Muhammad \r\n    ibn Bishr, who said: Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Amr told us: Abu Salamah and Yahya told \r\n    us: When Khadeejah died, Khawlah bint Hakeem, the wife of &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn \r\n    Maz&lsquo;oon, came and said: O Messenger of Allah, why don&rsquo;t you get married? He \r\n    said: To whom? She said: If you wish, a virgin, and if you wish, a \r\n    previously married woman. He said: Who is the virgin? She said: The daughter \r\n    of the dearest of Allah&rsquo;s creation to you: &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah bint Abi Bakr&hellip; And he \r\n    mentioned the story in detail, including the fact that she was six years old \r\n    when the marriage contract was done, and was nine years old when the \r\n    marriage was consummated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah narrated concerning herself, and it \r\n    was conveyed by the narrators from her, and it is what is stated in all the \r\n    historical sources that give the biography of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her). There is no difference among them concerning that, and \r\n    the matter was not subject to ijtihaad. When a person speaks about himself \r\n    (or herself), no one has the right to suggest anything else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The historical sources are also agreed that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with her) was born in Islam, four or five years after the \r\n    Prophet&rsquo;s mission began.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said &ndash; \r\n    commenting on the hadeeth, &ldquo;I only ever remember my parents as following \r\n    Islam&rdquo;&ndash;:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was born in Islam, \r\n    because her father became Muslim at the beginning of the Prophet&rsquo;s mission. \r\n    It is proven from al-Aswad, from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) \r\n    that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    married her when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage with \r\n    her when she was nine years old, and he died when she was eighteen years \r\n    old. But Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr was born during the Jaahiliyyah, and became \r\n    Muslim when her father became Muslim. &hellip; According to what Abu &lsquo;Abdullah ibn \r\n    Mandah said, narrating from Ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad, Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr was ten \r\n    years older than &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, and the mother of Asma&rsquo; became Muslim later on. \r\n    Asma&rsquo; (may Allah be pleased with her) said: My mother came to me and she was \r\n    (still) a mushrik. According to a hadeeth that she quoted, her name was \r\n    Qateelah,&nbsp; from Banu Maalik ibn Hasal. She was not the mother of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah. \r\n    Asma&rsquo; became Muslim when her father did, not her mother. With regard to &lsquo;Abd \r\n    ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr, it seems that he was an adult when his parents \r\n    became Muslim, but he did not follow them in becoming Muslim, until he \r\n    became Muslim a long time after that. He was the oldest of the children of \r\n    Abu Bakr.

So if you round up or down &ndash; as is \r\n    the custom of the Arabs in counting years &ndash; they round up or down the first \r\n    and last years, so her age at the time of the Hijrah was eight years, and \r\n    her age at the time when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) married her, eight months after the Hijrah, was nine years.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The above is also in accordance with what the scholars have \r\n    narrated concerning the difference in age between Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr and \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) said: She &ndash; i.e., Asma&rsquo; &ndash; was ten or more years older than \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the difference in age between &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and Asma&rsquo; was \r\n    fourteen or fifteen years. This is the view of adh-Dhahabi quoted above: She \r\n    &ndash; i.e., Asma&rsquo; &ndash; was ten or more years older than &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Although we quote these numbers that are mentioned in the \r\n    books of biography and history, what we mostly rely on is what is narrated \r\n    with saheeh isnaads, not what we find in books quoted without any isnaad. \r\n    But all of the reports are in accordance with the hadeeths with undoubtedly \r\n    saheeh isnaads that we quoted at the beginning of this answer. Hence we \r\n    quoted reports from the history books that support what we quoted above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the response to the author of the hostile article \r\n    quoting as evidence what is narrated in some sources about the age \r\n    difference between Asma&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah being ten years, we say:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That is not proven in terms of the isnaad or chain of \r\n    narrators. If its isnaad is proven, then it may be understood in a manner \r\n    that is in accordance with the definitive evidence mentioned above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the isnaad or chain of narrators, it was \r\n    narrated from &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad that he said: Asma&rsquo; bint Abi \r\n    Bakr was ten years older than &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This report was narrated via two isnaads from al-Asma &lsquo;i from \r\n    &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The first isnaad was narrated by Ibn &lsquo;Asaakir in <i>Tareekh \r\n    Dimashq<\/i> (69\/10). He said: Abu&rsquo;l-Hasan &lsquo;Ali ibn Ahmad al-Maaliki told us: \r\n    Ahmad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Waahid as-Sulami told us: My grandfather Abu Bakr told us: \r\n    Abu Muhammad ibn Zabr told us: Ahmad ibn Sa&lsquo;d ibn Ibraaheem az-Zuhri told \r\n    us: Muhammad ibn Abi Safwaan told us: al-Asma&lsquo;i told us, that Ibn \r\n    Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad&nbsp; said: &hellip; and he quoted the report.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second isnaad was narrated by Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr in <i>\r\n    al-Isti&lsquo;aab fi Ma&lsquo;rifat al-Ashaab<\/i> (2\/616): Ahmad ibn Qaasim told us: \r\n    Muhammad ibn Mu&lsquo;aawiyah told us; Ibraaheem ibn Moosa ibn Jameel told us: \r\n    Ismaa &lsquo;eel ibn Ishaaq al-Qaadi told us: Nasr ibn &lsquo;Ali told us: al-Asma&lsquo;i \r\n    told us: Ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad told us: Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr, who was ten years \r\n    or so older than &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, said:&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the fair-minded researcher thinks about this report it \r\n    will become clear to him that accepting its apparent meaning and rejecting \r\n    all the proven evidence to the contrary is an offence against knowledge and \r\n    scholarship, for the following reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad (100-174 AH) is the only \r\n    one who stated that the difference in age between Asma&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with them both) was ten years. The evidence mentioned \r\n    above, on the other hand, is abundant and was narrated from more than one of \r\n    the Taabi&lsquo;een. It is known that what is abundant takes precedence over that \r\n    which is smaller.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Most of the scholars regarded &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn \r\n    Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad himself as da&lsquo;eef (weak). In his biography of him in <i>\r\n    Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb<\/i> (6\/172), Imam Ahmad is quoted as saying concerning \r\n    him: He is mudtarab al-hadeeth (his hadeeth is faulty). Ibn Ma&lsquo;een is quoted \r\n    as saying: He is not one of those whom the scholars of hadeeth quote as \r\n    evidence. &lsquo;Ali ibn al-Madeeni is quoted as saying: Whatever he narrated in \r\n    Madinah is saheeh, but whatever he narrated in Baghdad was corrupted by the \r\n    Baghdadis. I saw &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan &ndash; i.e., Ibn Mahdi &ndash; draw a line through the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad. Abu Haatim said: His hadeeth \r\n    may be written down but it may not be quoted as evidence. An-Nasaa&rsquo;i said: \r\n    His hadeeth cannot be quoted as evidence. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to at-Tirmidhi describing him as thiqah \r\n    (trustworthy) in his <i>Sunan<\/i>, following hadeeth no. 1755, this \r\n    contradicts the criticism of the previous commentator, and criticism (of a \r\n    narrator) takes precedence over praise, especially with regard to the \r\n    reports that were narrated only by &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad , \r\n    especially when he says something that is contrary to what is well-known in \r\n    the books of the Sunnah and history.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the report of Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr, he said: &ldquo;She \r\n    (Asma&rsquo;) was ten years or so older than &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah.&rdquo; This report is more sound \r\n    than the report of Ibn &lsquo;Asaakir, because Nasr ibn &lsquo;Ali, who narrated it from \r\n    al-Asma&lsquo;i in the isnaad of Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr is thiqah (trustworthy), as it \r\n    says in <i>Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb<\/i>, 10\/431. With regard to Muhammad ibn Abi \r\n    Safwaan, the narrator from al-Asma&lsquo;i in the isnaad of Ibn &lsquo;Asaakir, no one \r\n    described him as trustworthy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words in the report of Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr, &ldquo;or so&rdquo;, \r\n    indicate that he was not certain about (the difference in age) being ten \r\n    years. This makes his report weak and it is not permissible for the \r\n    fair-minded researcher to reject the evidence quoted above for the sake of \r\n    this uncertainty.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, it is possible to reconcile this report with the \r\n    other reports by saying that Asma&rsquo; was born six years or five years before \r\n    the Prophet&rsquo;s mission began, and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah was born four or five years after \r\n    his mission began. When Asma&rsquo; died in 73 AH, she was ninety-one or \r\n    ninety-two years old, as was mentioned by adh-Dhahabi in <i>Siyar A&lsquo;laam \r\n    an-Nubala&rsquo;<\/i>, 3\/380: Ibn Abi&rsquo;z-Zinnaad said: She was ten years older than \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah. I (adh-Dhahabi) say: Based on that, her age would have been \r\n    ninety-one years. Hishaam ibn &lsquo;Urwah, on the other hand, said: She lived for \r\n    one hundred years and not one of her teeth fell out. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may also be said that Asma&rsquo; was born approximately 14 \r\n    years before the Prophet&rsquo;s mission began &ndash; which is what is affirmed by the \r\n    author himself in his previous article &ndash; and that in the year of the Hijrah \r\n    she was twenty-seven years old, and her age at the time of her death in 73 \r\n    AH was one hundred years, so as to be in harmony with what the historical \r\n    sources are agreed upon with regard to Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr, that she died in \r\n    the same year in which her son &lsquo;Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr was killed (73 AH), \r\n    and that she died at the age of one hundred years. Hishaam ibn &lsquo;Urwah said, \r\n    narrating from his father: Asma&rsquo; reached the age of one hundred years and \r\n    not one of her teeth fell out and she remained alert all her life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There follow the names of the sources that mention that:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Hilyat al-Awliya&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/56<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Mu&lsquo;jam as-Sahaabah<\/i> by Abi Na&lsquo;eem \r\n    al-Asbahaani<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Isti&lsquo;aab<\/i> by Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr, \r\n    4\/1783<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tareekh Dimashq<\/i> by Ibn &lsquo;Asaakir, \r\n    69\/8<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Asad al-Ghaabah<\/i> by Ibn \r\n    al-Atheer, 7\/12<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Isaabah<\/i> by Ibn Hajar, 7\/487<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tahdheeb al-Kamaal<\/i>, 35\/125&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the idea of her having been born ten years \r\n    before the Prophet&rsquo;s mission began, this was only stated by Abu Na&lsquo;eem \r\n    al-Asbahaani, in a statement in which he said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    She &ndash; i.e., Asma&rsquo; &ndash; was the sister of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah through her \r\n    father. She was older than &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah; she was born twenty-seven years before \r\n    the Hijrah, and ten years before the mission of the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) began.

There was no one left of \r\n    the sons of Adam apart from the progeny of Nooh. So all nations are among \r\n    the progeny of the three sons of Nooh. The apparent meaning of this is that \r\n    those who believed with Nooh apart from his sons did not have any offspring. \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: When Nooh came out of the ark, the men and women who were \r\n    with him died, except for his sons and his wives.

As there is nothing \r\n    in the Qur&rsquo;an or Sunnah, or scholarly consensus and analogy, or reports, to \r\n    indicate that it is not allowed to get married in the month of Muharram, \r\n    then our rulings and fatwas should be based on the ruling that it is \r\n    basically permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholarly consensus that it is permissible is, at the \r\n    minimum, a consensus of silence, as we have not found any of the earlier or \r\n    later scholars, among the Sahaabah or Taabi&lsquo;een, or among the widely \r\n    accepted imams and their followers until the present day, stating that it is \r\n    haraam, or even makrooh, to get married or propose marriage in the month of \r\n    Muharram.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If anyone disallows that, it is sufficient evidence for \r\n    rejecting his opinion to note that he has given a fatwa for which there is \r\n    no evidence and which has not been suggested by any of the scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The month of Muharram is one of the venerated and honourable \r\n    months of Allah. Concerning its virtue, it was narrated that the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best of fasts after \r\n    Ramadan is Allah&rsquo;s month of Muharram.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 1163. It is the \r\n    month that Allah has described as His, and has ordained that fasting during \r\n    this month brings a greater reward than fasting in other months; therefore \r\n    it is appropriate for a Muslim to seek the blessing of this month by doing \r\n    such acts, and not to be sad or to fear getting married at that time, or to \r\n    regard it as inauspicious, as was the custom during the Jaahiliyyah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If anyone gives as evidence for not allowing marriage at this \r\n    time the fact that the month of Muharram is the month in which al-Husayn ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was martyred, as some of the Raafidis \r\n    do, the response to that should be as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no doubt that the day of the martyrdom of Husayn \r\n    (may Allah be pleased with him) is a day of great calamity in the history of \r\n    Islam, but it does not mean that we should rule it to be haraam to get \r\n    married or propose marriage at that time. There is nothing in Islam to \r\n    suggest that we should renew sorrow and grief in annual commemorations and \r\n    continue morning to the extent that we forbid any expressions of joy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We are within our rights to ask the one who says that: Isn&rsquo;t \r\n    the day on which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) died the greatest calamity that befell the Muslim ummah? So why is \r\n    it not also haraam to get married during that entire month, namely Rabee&lsquo; \r\n    al-Awwal? Why hasn&rsquo;t that ruling that it is haraam or makrooh been narrated \r\n    from any of the Sahaabah or members of the Prophet&rsquo;s household (Ahl \r\n    al-Bayt), or the scholars after them?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, if we were to renew our sorrow on every day on \r\n    which one of the great leaders of Islam, from among the family (ahl al-bayt) \r\n    of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or others, was \r\n    killed or martyred or died, there would be too many such days to ever allow \r\n    any day of joy and happiness, and the people would be burdened with \r\n    unbearable hardship. Undoubtedly introducing innovations into the religion \r\n    of Allah is, first and foremost, going to harm the people who go against \r\n    Islamic teachings, those who think that they can add something to make Islam \r\n    perfect (when it is already perfect), and are not content with it as it has \r\n    been prescribed by Allah for His slaves. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the historians stated that the first one to introduce \r\n    this opinion, and indeed the first one to introduce the innovation of \r\n    renewing outward displays of mourning at the beginning of the month of \r\n    Muharram was the Safavid Shah Ismaa&lsquo;eel (907-930 AH), as Dr. &lsquo;Ali al-Wardi \r\n    says in <i>Lamahaat Ijtimaa&lsquo;iyyah min Tareekh al-Islam<\/i>, 1\/59: \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shah Ismaa&lsquo;eel did not only use terror as a means of \r\n    spreading Shi&lsquo;ism; rather he also employed other means, namely propagation \r\n    and winning over people&rsquo;s hearts and minds. He issued orders that ceremonies \r\n    be organised to commemorate the murder of al-Husayn in the manner that is \r\n    still followed now. This way of commemoration was originally introduced by \r\n    the Buwayhids in Baghdad in the fourth century AH, but those who came after \r\n    them had neglected this practice. Then finally Shah Ismaa&lsquo;eel came along and \r\n    developed it and added to it the gatherings for mourning, in such a manner \r\n    that they had a strong impact on people&rsquo;s hearts. It may be true to say that \r\n    this is one of the strongest factors in the spread of Shi&lsquo;ism in Iran, \r\n    because of what they involve of expressions of grief and weeping, \r\n    accompanied by large numbers of flags, beating the drums and so on, which \r\n    leads to instilling the belief in people&rsquo;s hearts on an emotional basis. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, some historians regard it as most likely that &lsquo;Ali \r\n    ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) married Faatimah (may Allah \r\n    be pleased with her) at the beginning of 3 AH.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bayhaqi quoted from <i>al-Ma&lsquo;rifa<\/i>h by Abu &lsquo;Abdullah \r\n    ibn Mandah that &lsquo;Ali married Faatimah one year after the Hijrah, and \r\n    consummated the marriage with her one year after that.

The director of the \r\n    Islamic Centre may look at her case and give her in marriage to one who is \r\n    compatible, if she does not have any guardians of her own and there is no \r\n    qaadi. If the wali lives far away, he should be corresponded with ot spoken \r\n    to until he appoints someone as his proxy (wakeel). But if it is not known \r\n    where he is, then the next closest wali takes his place; the one who is most \r\n    closely related to him takes his place.

It is in accordance with the ruling of the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and with his \r\n    commands and prohibitions, the basic principles of his sharee&lsquo;ah and the \r\n    best interests of his ummah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, 5\/88&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is \r\n    it permissible for a father to force his daughter to marry someone she does \r\n    not want?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer was:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Neither the father nor anyone else has the right to force his \r\n    female relative who is under his guardianship to marry someone she does not \r\n    want. Rather it is essential to seek her permission, because the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No previously married \r\n    woman is to be given in marriage until she is consulted, and no virgin is to \r\n    be given in marriage until her permission is sought.&rdquo; They said: O Messenger \r\n    of Allah, what is her permission? He said: &ldquo;If she remains silent.&rdquo; So what \r\n    the father must do is seek her permission if she has reached the age of nine \r\n    or more. By the same token, her guardians should not give her in marriage \r\n    except with her permission. This is what is required of all, and if anyone \r\n    has got married without permission, then the marriage is not valid, because \r\n    one of the conditions of marriage is the consent of both spouses. If he has \r\n    given her in marriage without her consent and has forced her with stern \r\n    threats or beatings, then the marriage is not valid. If the husband knows \r\n    that she does not want him he should not go ahead with it, even if the \r\n    father does not care about that. What he must do is fear Allah, and not go \r\n    ahead with marriage to a woman who does not want him, even if her father \r\n    claims that he did not force her. What he must do is be cautious not to do \r\n    that which Allah has forbidden to him, because the Messenger (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) has instructed that her permission must be \r\n    sought. We also advise the woman to fear Allah and to agree if her father \r\n    wants to arrange her marriage, if the suitor is good in terms of his \r\n    religious commitment and character.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&lsquo;ah<\/i>, \r\n    20\/414-415&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you have to sincerely advise this father and inform him of \r\n    this shar&lsquo;i ruling, and tell him that what is required of the Muslim is to \r\n    follow the guidance of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him), and to discard any societal customs that are contrary to that. He \r\n    should look at what is in his daughter&rsquo;s best interests and look for someone \r\n    whose religious commitment and character are good, and whom his daughter \r\n    will accept as a husband. He is responsible for her because she is part of \r\n    his flock, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible. The ruler is a \r\n    shepherd and is responsible. A man is the shepherd of his household and is \r\n    responsible. A woman is the shepherd of her husband&rsquo;s house and is \r\n    responsible. The slave is the shepherd of his master&rsquo;s wealth and is \r\n    responsible. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5188, from the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n    (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up the above:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Her second marriage is definitely invalid, and there is no \r\n    way it can be valid, and she should not let him be intimate with her; rather \r\n    she must inform him of the facts of the matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for her first marriage, it is invalid according to the \r\n    majority of scholars, and they have to repeat the marriage contract in the \r\n    correct manner, if they want to remain married, or else annul the marriage \r\n    and separate, if they want to end it. (In that case), she has to observe \r\n    &lsquo;iddah following the end of the marriage, then she may marry whomever she \r\n    wants after that.

It does not \r\n    necessarily mean that there is a narration describing that action; rather \r\n    this refers to the way in which a particular act was performed and was \r\n    passed down through the generations by means of tawaatur (i.e., passed down \r\n    by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could have all \r\n    agreed upon a lie).&nbsp; This is what is called &ldquo;Sunnah,&rdquo; and this is mentioned \r\n    alongside the Book (the Qur&rsquo;an) in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;I am leaving among you two things and you will never go \r\n    astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allah, may He be exalted, \r\n    and the Sunnah of His Messenger.&rdquo; This is what it is not permissible for any \r\n    Muslim, no matter who he is, to forsake or go against, otherwise he has no \r\n    share in Islam.

The Jews used to condemn abrogation and claim that it was not \r\n    permissible, even though it was referred to in the Torah; thus their \r\n    rejection of it constituted disbelief and was based on pure whims and \r\n    desires.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allah, may He be exalted, \r\n    has told us of His wisdom in abrogation, and that whenever He abrogates any \r\n    verse &ldquo;<i>or cause[s] [it] to be \r\n    forgotten<\/i>&rdquo; i.e., causes people to forget it \r\n    and removes it from their hearts<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;<i>We \r\n    bring a better one<\/i>&rdquo; that is more beneficial \r\n    for you<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;<i>or \r\n    similar to it.<\/i>&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This indicates that the \r\n    abrogation will not be less beneficial to you than the original ruling, \r\n    because Allah&rsquo;s bounty always increases, especially for this ummah, for \r\n    which He has made its religion very easy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And He tells us that \r\n    whoever rejects abrogation has rejected His sovereignty and might, as He \r\n    says: &ldquo;<i>Know you not that Allah \r\n    is able to do all things?

Thus the prohibition on fleeing when the \r\n    number of the enemy was double that of the Muslims was abrogated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn &lsquo;Atiyyah (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Complete abrogation is when \r\n    both the verses and the ruling are abrogated, of which there are many \r\n    examples. Also, the verses may be abrogated but not the ruling, or the \r\n    ruling may be abrogated but not the verses. The verses and the ruling are \r\n    two different things; one of them may be abrogated but not the other.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Al-Muharrar al-Wajeez<\/i>, \r\n    1\/131&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-&lsquo;Azeem az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The abrogation that \r\n    occurred in the Qur&rsquo;an was of three different types: abrogation of both the \r\n    verses and the ruling, abrogation of the ruling but not the verses, and \r\n    abrogation of the verses but not the ruling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Abrogation of both the ruling \r\n    and the verses&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is consensus on this \r\n    type of abrogation among those Muslims who accept the concept abrogation. \r\n    Proof that it occurred is seen in the report from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her) who said: Among \r\n    the things that were revealed of the Qur&rsquo;an was that ten definite \r\n    breastfeedings make a person a mahram, then that was abrogated and replaced \r\n    with five definite breastfeedings, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) passed away when this was among the things that \r\n    were still recited of the Qur&rsquo;an. Narrated by \r\n    Muslim, 1452. Although this report is mawqoof and its isnaad ends with \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, it is deemed to be marfoo&lsquo; (attributable to the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) because such a thing could not \r\n    be said on the basis of personal opinion; rather such matters must \r\n    inevitably have been learned from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him). It is well known that the phrase &ldquo;ten \r\n    definite breastfeedings make a person a mahram&rdquo; \r\n    does not exist in the Mushaf and the ruling mentioned is no longer in \r\n    effect. This proves that abrogation of both the verses and the ruling is \r\n    something that occurred, and if it is proven that it occurred, then it is \r\n    proven that this idea is sound, because proving that is occurred is the \r\n    first evidence that it is possible and sound. And the view of those who deny \r\n    that the idea of complete abrogation is not possible, such as Abu Muslim \r\n    [al-Isfahaani, a Mu&lsquo;tazili scholar of usool] and his ilk is proven to be \r\n    invalid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Abrogation of the \r\n    ruling but not the verses&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>this is \r\n    indicated in many verses, such as the verse which speaks of giving charity \r\n    before speaking to the Messenger, which is the verse in which Allah, may He \r\n    be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;O you who believe! \r\n    When you (want to) consult the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) in private, spend \r\n    something in charity before your private consultation&rdquo; [al-Mujaadilah 58:12]<\/i>. \r\n    This was abrogated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Are you afraid of spending in charity \r\n    before your private consultation (with him)? If then you do it not, and \r\n    Allah has forgiven you, then (at least) perform As-Salat (Iqamat as-Salat) \r\n    and give Zakat and obey Allah and His Messenger.&rdquo; [al-Mujaadilah 58:13]<\/i>. \r\n    The ruling mentioned in the first verse is abrogated by the ruling mentioned \r\n    in the second verse, although both verses remain.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Another \r\n    example is the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified, says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And as for those \r\n    who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man, etc.), they have (a choice \r\n    either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)&rdquo; [al-Baqarah \r\n    2:184]<\/i>.

Al-Haafiz said in <i>at-Taqreeb<\/i> (389): He is acceptable, \r\n    i.e., if there is any corroborating evidence, otherwise his hadeeth is \r\n    layyin &ndash; as was stated in the introduction.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no corroborating evidence for &lsquo;Arfajah&rsquo;s version of \r\n    this report with these additions. Rather he was contradicted by someone who \r\n    is far more trustworthy than him, namely Sufyaan ath-Thawri. Al-Haakim \r\n    (3839) narrated via Ibn al-Mubaarak, and at-Tabaraani narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Kabeer<\/i> via &lsquo;Abd ar-Razzaaq (8651), both from Sufyaan, from &lsquo;Aasim, \r\n    from Zirr, from Ibn Mas&lsquo;ood&nbsp; (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: \r\n    &ldquo;(Angels) will come to a man in his grave; they will come to his feet and \r\n    his feet will say: You have no power over us; he used to recite Soorat \r\n    al-Mulk. Then they will come to his chest or his stomach and it will say: \r\n    You have no power over me; he used to recite Soorat al-Mulk. Then they will \r\n    come to his head and it will say: You have no power over me; he used to \r\n    recite Soorat al-Mulk. So it is the maani&lsquo;ah (protector) that protects \r\n    against the punishment of the grave and it is referred to in the Torah as \r\n    Soorat al-Mulk, whoever recites it by night has done a great deal and has \r\n    done well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the correct report and it is what is known to the \r\n    scholars. The words &ldquo;Whoever recites it every night, Allah will protect him \r\n    thereby from the punishment of the grave&rdquo;, which appear in the hadeeth of \r\n    &lsquo;Arfajah, are not known to the scholars, and attribution thereof to the \r\n    Prophet (sa) is also not known to them. What is correct with regard to the \r\n    isnaad is that it is mawqoof (ends with the Sahaabi), as in this report of \r\n    Sufyaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was also narrated by Abu&rsquo;sh-Shaykh in <i>Tabaqaat \r\n    al-Asbahaaniyyeen<\/i> (264) in a shorter, marfoo&lsquo; report from Ibn Mas&lsquo;ood, \r\n    as follows: &ldquo;Soorah Tabaarak (al-Mulk) is that which protects against the \r\n    punishment of the grave.&rdquo; It was narrated via Abu Ahmad az-Zubayri from \r\n    Sufyaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Concerning Abu Ahmad az-Zubayri, Ahmad said: He made many \r\n    mistakes in the hadeeth he narrated from Sufyaan. Abu Haatim said: He was a \r\n    devoted worshipper and had good knowledge of hadeeth, but he made mistakes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb<\/i>, 9\/228&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is one of his mistakes when narrating from Sufyaan (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him). The correct report is the mawqoof report, as \r\n    quoted above from Ibn al-Mubaarak and &lsquo;Abd ar-Razzaaq.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Something similar may be said if it is deemed to be marfoo&lsquo; \r\n    (attributed to the Prophet (sa) via a complete isnaad), as was stated by \r\n    more than one of the scholars. And this is in harmony with what is stated \r\n    above. The hadeeth is general in meaning and it is not stipulated that it \r\n    should be recited at night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Mannaawi said in <i>at-Tayseer<\/i> (2\/62):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The soorah will give protection to the one who recited it; \r\n    when he dies and is placed in his grave, he will not be punished there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu&rsquo;l-Hasan al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant is that reciting this soorah in this world will \r\n    be a means of salvation from the punishment of the grave.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Mar&lsquo;aat al-Mafaateeh<\/i>, 7\/231&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him), the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not sleep \r\n    until he recited <i>Alif-Laam-Meem tanzeel<\/i> (Soorat as-Sajdah) and <i>\r\n    Tabaarak alladhi bi yahihi al-mulk <\/i>(Soorat al-Mulk).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2892) and others; classed as saheeh \r\n    by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him). However it appears to be \r\n    ma&lsquo;lool (problematic), as was stated by Ibn Abi Haatim, narrating from his \r\n    father, in <i>al-&lsquo;Ilal<\/i>, 1668, and <i>&lsquo;Ilal ad-Daaraqutni<\/i>, 13\/340. \r\n    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) agreed with him, as it \r\n    says in <i>Ithaaf al-Mahrah<\/i>, 3\/155. He also said, after discussing its \r\n    isnaad: Based on that, it is mursal or mu&lsquo;dal (i.e., not sound). End quote \r\n    from <i>Nataa&rsquo;ij al-Afkaar<\/i>, 3\/267&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is the hope that the one who recites this soorah will \r\n    attain this great virtue and it will intercede for him before Allah and save \r\n    him from the punishment of the grave. There are reports which speak in \r\n    particular about giving extra attention to it at night or when going to \r\n    sleep. So if a person strives to do that, it is a good thing, in sha Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information, please see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]26240[\\fatin]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best. <\/p>\t\t<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11284","question_id":"20953","answers":"Praise be to Allah<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best \r\n    religion is that which has proof that it is the religion with which the \r\n    Creator (may He be glorified and exalted) is pleased, and which He sent down \r\n    as light for humanity, to bring them happiness in their worldly lives and to \r\n    save them in the Hereafter. Proof or evidence must be very clear, so that \r\n    people can have no doubts about it or challenge it. Allah (may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted) knows what the liars and charlatans produce of flawed \r\n    evidence to support their lies; hence He chose to support His Messengers and \r\n    Prophets with comprehensive miracles and clear signs, which confirmed to \r\n    people the truthfulness of this man who has received revelation from his \r\n    Lord, so that they will believe in him and follow him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus the \r\n    Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    brought dazzling miracles, of which there are many, about which huge books \r\n    have been written. But the greatest of them is the Holy Qur&rsquo;an, which \r\n    challenged the Arabs to produce anything like it in all aspects of its \r\n    perfection, because it contains the linguistic miracle that the eloquent \r\n    speakers of Quraysh &ndash; who had attained the pinnacle of eloquence, as \r\n    attested by all historians &ndash; could not produce the like of it. It also \r\n    contains the scientific miracle, as the Holy Qur&rsquo;an &ndash; and also the Prophet&rsquo;s \r\n    Sunnah &ndash; refer to some scientific facts before anybody knew about them, the \r\n    like of which humanity could not have known at that time except via divine \r\n    revelation. It also spoke of events in the distant past and of future \r\n    events, and Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) could not \r\n    have had prior knowledge of history, nor was there anyone in that land who \r\n    possessed this knowledge at all, apart from some remnants of the people of \r\n    the Book. It also contains the legislative miracle, as is seen in its \r\n    comprehensive system that covers personal manners and etiquette, rulings on \r\n    the family and personal matters, regulation of international relations and \r\n    rulings on social matters; it lay the foundations for principles of justice \r\n    and freedom among people; it affirmed of the concepts of this world, the \r\n    unseen and the Hereafter, and the concepts of eternal bliss or doom. All of \r\n    that came from an unlettered man who could neither read nor write, but his \r\n    enemies attested to his honesty and trustworthiness before his friends did. \r\n    Then this Qur&rsquo;an became the basis on which the Muslims built the brilliant \r\n    Islamic civilisation that has lasted for more than fourteen hundred years.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best \r\n    religion in our view is the religion which connects you to one force, which \r\n    is the force that created you and blessed you and has full control over the \r\n    heavens and the earth. It is the force that will have mercy on you and will \r\n    be with you in the Hereafter, if you believe in it and do righteous deeds. \r\n    It is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, the One, the Unique, the \r\n    Self-Sustaining and All-Sustaining. (The best religion) does not connect you \r\n    to anything other than Him, for everything other than Him is created and \r\n    weak, and is in need of Him, may He be glorified. Thus man can liberate \r\n    himself from the bonds of servitude to anything but Allah, the True God, and \r\n    he can free himself from earthly connections that cause humanity \r\n    humiliation, wrongdoing, and persecution, all of which is done in the name \r\n    of the false religion that approves of the caste system [see the research \r\n    paper <i>at-Tabaqaat fi&rsquo;l-Mujtama&lsquo; al-Hindoosi<\/i> (Caste in Hindu society) \r\n    in the book by Dr al-A&lsquo;zami, <i>Diraasaat<\/i> (p. 4)], approves of servitude \r\n    to other than Allah, may He be exalted, and in fact approves of servitude to \r\n    animals such as cows and others. Man, whom Allah has honoured with reason \r\n    and the soul which is created by Him, becomes a prisoner to those animals \r\n    which he regards as holy, and reveres and venerates them, although they have \r\n    no power to bring him any benefit or ward off any harm; indeed they cannot \r\n    do that for themselves, let alone others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best \r\n    religion is that which offers an integrated system which guides man to the \r\n    way of happiness in this world and the Hereafter, because the aim of \r\n    religions is to achieve happiness, and that cannot be achieved without \r\n    guidance from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. In Islam we find \r\n    guidance on all aspects of life: economic, political, social, familial and \r\n    psychological, in order to achieve this integrated happiness. When the \r\n    Muslims adhered to these teachings in the earliest period, they established \r\n    a prosperous life one the basis of justice and fair-mindedness. When they \r\n    became heedless, they lost the prosperity that Allah had granted to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best of \r\n    religions is that which came latest in chronological sequence, confirming \r\n    what came before it of true religions, abrogating some of the \r\n    previously-revealed laws that were suitable to the time and place in which \r\n    they became widespread, and fulfilling the prophecies mentioned in those \r\n    religions, that spoke of a Prophet who would be sent at the end of time, and \r\n    described his signs and characteristics. The Holy Qur&rsquo;an tells us that all \r\n    of the previous Messengers and Prophets knew of a Prophet who would be sent \r\n    at the end of time, whose name would be Muhammad, with whom Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, would bring to an end the series of Messengers. \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And \r\n    (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: &lsquo;Take \r\n    whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of \r\n    Allah, etc.), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad \r\n    SAW) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help \r\n    him.&rsquo; Allah said: &lsquo;Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant \r\n    (which I conclude with you)?&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;We agree.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Then bear \r\n    witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Anbiya&rsquo; \r\n    21:81]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we find \r\n    in the remnant that was not distorted of the previous religions clear \r\n    prophecies that speak of this noble Prophet. The Torah and the Gospel are \r\n    full of them, but there is no need to quote them here. Rather what concerns \r\n    us is that which is mentioned in the holy books of the Hindus of clear \r\n    prophecies that speak of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him). These prophecies do not necessarily mean that all of these \r\n    books are sound or true; rather they point to a few words of truth remaining \r\n    in them, that was taken from the Messages and Prophets that were sent a long \r\n    time ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These texts \r\n    have been quoted by Dr Muhammad Diya&rsquo; ar-Rahman al-A&lsquo;zami in his valuable \r\n    book <i>Diraasaat fi&rsquo;l-Yahoodiyyah wa&rsquo;l-Maseehiyyah wa Adyaan al-Hind<\/i> \r\n    (Studies in Judaism, Christianity and Indian Religions), p. 703-746, \r\n    especially since the author is a doctor from India who is able to read those \r\n    books that have not been translated into Arabic as far as we know.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;At that time \r\n    in the city of Shambhala (which means the safe land or place of peace), in \r\n    the house of a man whose name is Vishnu Bhagat (meaning &lsquo;Abdullah or slave \r\n    of God), who is pure of heart, in his house will be born Kalki (meaning one \r\n    who is pure and free of sins and iniquities).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Bhagavata \r\n    Purana<\/i>, \r\n    2\/18&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is \r\n    well-known that the name of the father of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) was &lsquo;Abdullah (meaning slave of Allah or \r\n    servant of God), and in the Qur&rsquo;an, Makkah (Mecca) is called the safe land.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Kalki will be \r\n    born in the house of Vishnu Bhagat, from his wife Soomati, whose name means \r\n    the woman of peace and security, which is the meaning of the name Aaminah.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Kalki \r\n    Purana<\/i>, \r\n    2\/11&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also \r\n    well-known that the name of the mother of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) was Aaminah bint Wahb.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;He will be \r\n    born on the twelfth of the month called Madhva (also known as Chaitra, \r\n    spring month) [which means the month that is beloved to people, which is the \r\n    month of ar-Rabee&lsquo; (lit. &ldquo;spring&rdquo;)].&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Kalki \r\n    Purana<\/i>, \r\n    2\/15&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The books of \r\n    the Prophet&rsquo;s biography clearly state the date of his birth, which was the \r\n    twelfth of the month of Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal, although there are differences of \r\n    opinion among the scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Kalki will \r\n    have eight characteristics, as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Pragya \r\n    (foretell the future)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Culinata (one \r\n    of the noblest of his people)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Indridaman \r\n    (self-control)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shrut (receive \r\n    revelation)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Prakram \r\n    (physical strength)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abhu bhashita \r\n    (speaks little)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Dan (generous)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Kritagyata \r\n    (acknowledges kindness).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of them \r\n    are a few of the attributes of Sayyiduna Muhammad (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) which were acknowledged by all the Arabs who knew him, \r\n    whether they entered Islam or remained disbelievers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;He will ride \r\n    on a horse from which light comes, and no one can compete with his awe and \r\n    beauty; he will be circumcised; and will destroy hundreds of thousands of \r\n    wrongdoers and disbelievers<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Bhagavata \r\n    Purana<\/i>, \r\n    12-2-20&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Circumcision \r\n    is not practised by the Hindus; rather it is an Islamic obligation upon the \r\n    males of the ummah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;With the help \r\n    of four of his companions he will destroy the devil, and the angels will \r\n    come down to earth to help him in his battles.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Kalki \r\n    Purana<\/i>, \r\n    2\/5-7&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The four \r\n    companions of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are the \r\n    Rightly-Guided Caliphs who ruled after him.

They lose in worldly terms, let alone in terms \r\n    of the Hereafter, by using this kind of mocking language, telling lies about \r\n    Allah, distorting the meaning of His Book and, in fact, blatantly distorting \r\n    the wording thereof.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    here we will \r\n    quote the views of some scholars who forbade this kind of referring to the \r\n    text if it is done in the context of mockery and disrespect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As-Suyooti \r\n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One kind of \r\n    reprehensible referral to texts is quoting a verse in the context of a joke \r\n    &ndash; we seek refuge with Allah from that &ndash; such as saying (in verse):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;She conveyed \r\n    a message to her lovers with her eyes, &lsquo;Far, \r\n    very far is that which you are promised&rsquo; \r\n    [cf. al-Mu&rsquo;minoon 23:36];<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Seek physical \r\n    intimacy with her &ndash; &lsquo;For the like of this let all strive, who wish to \r\n    strive&rsquo; [cf. as-Saaffaat 37:61].&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from\r\n    <i>al-Itqaan fi &lsquo;Uloom al-Qur&rsquo;an<\/i>, 1\/387; as-Suyooti quoted this \r\n    categorization (of ways of quoting or referring to Qur&rsquo;an, into those which \r\n    are acceptable and those which are not) from one of the scholars, and \r\n    approved of this categorization.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he \r\n    (as-Suyooti &ndash; may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I do not know \r\n    of any difference of opinion among the scholars that this is permissible to \r\n    refer to the Qur&rsquo;an, provided that the context is not one of approving of \r\n    promiscuity, immorality, mockery on the part of evildoers, drinking alcohol, \r\n    promoting homosexuality, and so on.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from\r\n    <i>Tanweer al-Hawaalik Sharh Muwatta&rsquo; Maalik<\/i>, 1\/312<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Aqeel \r\n    al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Referencing \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;an in the context of improper speech is not permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from \r\n    Ibn Muflih in <i>al-Adaab ash-Shar&lsquo;iyyah<\/i>, 2\/289.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some examples of \r\n    referring to Qur&rsquo;anic texts, such as when someone said, &ldquo;Today we have seen \r\n    Noon and what they know (noonwa ma ya &lsquo;lamoon)&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (this is a \r\n    rhyme which tries to sound like what is mentioned at the beginning of Soorat \r\n    al-Qalam).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the one \r\n    who said that by way of mockery, this is a very serious matter; it may even \r\n    be said that he has gone beyond the pale of Islam, because it is not \r\n    permissible under any circumstances to quote the Qur&rsquo;an by way of mockery, \r\n    and the same applies to Islamic rulings.

The Messenger of Allah (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) quoted verses in relation to incidents that \r\n    occurred. He quoted the verse (interpretation of the meaning), <i>&ldquo;<\/i><i>Your \r\n    wealth and your children are only a trial&rdquo;<\/i> \r\n    [at-Taghaabun 64:15], when [his grandsons] al-Hasan and al-Husayn came \r\n    stumbling; he came down from the minbar and said: (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning), <i>&ldquo;<\/i><i>Your wealth and your children are only \r\n    a trial&rdquo;<\/i> \r\n    [at-Taghaabun 64:15].

This passage, in the King James Version (KJV), reads \r\n    as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><sup>5&nbsp;<\/sup>Blessed \r\n    is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.<\/p>\r\n    <p><sup>6&nbsp;<\/sup>Who \r\n    passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the \r\n    pools.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <sup>10&nbsp;<\/sup>For \r\n    a day in thy courts is better than a thousand (elsewhere).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no valley on earth called Baca (or Bakkah) that \r\n    contains a house of worship and a spring of water (Zamzam), in which one \r\n    prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, other than \r\n    Makkah al-Mukarramah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Baca (Bakkah) is one of the names of Makkah.

The well known academic principle says that the fact \r\n    that a thing is not mentioned does not mean that it did not happen. In other \r\n    words, denying that something happened should take the form of a negative \r\n    statement. The fact that no mention is made of its happening does not \r\n    necessarily mean that it did not happen; rather the reason why it was not \r\n    mentioned may be that it was omitted, forgotten, summarized in brief, and \r\n    the like. If you find news of something in one newspaper, then you find that \r\n    it is not mentioned at all in another newspaper, the fact that it is not \r\n    mentioned in the latter does not mean that it did not happen. Whoever thinks \r\n    in such terms is lacking in reason and is making no sense.

We can sum up the \r\n    stages of development in the following four main stages:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Origin:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The main focus at \r\n    this stage was intense debates with the Mu&lsquo;tazilah. The prominent figure at \r\n    this stage was Abu Mansoor al-Maturidi, whose full name was Muhammad ibn \r\n    Muhammad ibn Mahmoud al-Maturidi as-Samarqandi; he was named after Maturid, \r\n    which is a place near Samarkand in Transoxiana, where he was born.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He is regarded as \r\n    one of the pioneers of the rational school; he did not acquire a great deal \r\n    of knowledge of Islamic texts and the science of hadeeth, which is the case \r\n    with the majority of scholars in the fields of kalaam and usool.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Mansoor \r\n    al-Maturidi was influenced by Jahmi beliefs in many ways, the most \r\n    significant of which was: the interpretation of texts that speak of some of \r\n    the divine attributes that are classed as <i>sifaat khabariyyah<\/i> \r\n    (attributes that are based on texts and cannot be proven by rational \r\n    thought, such as the divine Countenance, Hand and so on) in a manner other \r\n    than the apparent meaning. He also came under the influence of the \r\n    innovation (bid&lsquo;ah) and ideas of the Murji&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He was also \r\n    influenced by Ibn Kullaab (d. 240 AH) and his innovation of the concept of \r\n    divine &ldquo;self-talk&rdquo; (<i>al-kalaam an-nafsi<\/i>)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Development:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the stage \r\n    during which the students of al-Maturidi and those who were influenced by \r\n    him developed his ideas further, and formed an independent kalaami \r\n    (philosophical) group. The group first appeared in Samarkand, and worked to \r\n    spread and defend the thought of their shaykh and leader, and wrote books. \r\n    They followed the madhhab of Imam Abu Haneefah with regard to minor issues \r\n    of Islam. Thus Maturidi beliefs became more widespread in Samarkand than \r\n    elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the most \r\n    well-known figures during this stage were: Abu&rsquo;l-Qaasim Ishaaq ibn Muhammad \r\n    ibn Ismaa&lsquo;eel al-Hakeem as-Samarqandi and Abu Muhammad &lsquo;Abd al-Kareem ibn \r\n    Moosa ibn &lsquo;Eesa al-Bazdawi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Consolidation \r\n    of Maturidi beliefs:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The main feature \r\n    of this stage was prolific writing of books and compiling of evidence on \r\n    which the Maturidi beliefs were based. Therefore it was the most important \r\n    stage in terms of consolidating this school of thought.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the most \r\n    important figures during this stage were: Abu&rsquo;l-Ma&lsquo;een an-Nasafi and Najm \r\n    ad-Deen &lsquo;Umar an-Nasafi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Expansion and \r\n    spread:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is regarded \r\n    as one of the most important stages, in which the Maturidis reached the peak \r\n    of their expansion and spread. That was due to the support of the Ottoman \r\n    sultans. Maturidi dominance spread wherever Ottoman dominance reached. So \r\n    they spread eastwards and westwards in the Arab lands, India, and the lands \r\n    of the Turks, Persians and Byzantines.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There were many \r\n    prominent scholars among them, such as al-Kamaal ibn Humaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maturidis \r\n    spread and the number of followers increased in India and neighbouring \r\n    Eastern countries, such as China, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They \r\n    also spread in Turkey, the Byzantine lands, Persia and Transoxiana; they \r\n    still have a strong presence in these countries.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The differences \r\n    between them and Ahl as-Sunnah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maturidis \r\n    divided the fundamentals of Islam as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Rational theology \r\n    (<i>al-ilaahiyyaat al-&lsquo;aqliyyat<\/i>)&rdquo; &ndash; this refers to what can be proven by \r\n    reason, and the texts are secondary to that; that includes Tawheed (the \r\n    Oneness of Allah) and the divine attributes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Different issues \r\n    of religion based on texts (<i>sam&lsquo;iyyaat<\/i> <i>shar&lsquo;iyyaat<\/i>)&rdquo;&ndash; this \r\n    refers to matters which, on the basis of reason, we may be certain that they \r\n    are possible, but there is no rational proof to confirm them or otherwise; \r\n    that includes Prophethood, the punishment of the grave, and matters \r\n    pertaining to the hereafter. However it is worth noting that some of them \r\n    included Prophethood under the previous heading (&ldquo;rational theology&rdquo;).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is very clear \r\n    that what is stated above is contrary to the way of Ahl as-Sunnah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah, for whom the Qur&rsquo;an, Sunnah and consensus of the Sahaabah are \r\n    the sources of knowledge, and that applies to all issues of religion. (That \r\n    is, they do not divide them into two categories as the Maturidis did.)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, they \r\n    differed from Ahl as-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah in the innovation of dividing the \r\n    fundamentals of Islam (<i>usool ad-deen<\/i>) into those that are based on \r\n    rational evidence and those that are based on texts. This idea is based on a \r\n    false notion, which is that matters of religion and belief may be divided \r\n    into principles that may be proven by reason and could not be proven by \r\n    only; rather the textual proof with regard to these matters may be regarded \r\n    as additional evidence that supplements what is indicated by rational \r\n    evidence concerning these fundamental issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maturidis, \r\n    like other kalaami (philosophical) groups such as the Mu&lsquo;tazilah and \r\n    Ash&lsquo;aris, discussed the necessity of knowing Allah, may He be exalted, on \r\n    the basis of reason before studying the texts (of Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah); they \r\n    regarded that as the foremost duty of any accountable person, and said that \r\n    there was no excuse for not doing that. Rather they believe that a person \r\n    would be punished for not doing it, even if that was before any Prophets or \r\n    Messengers were sent. Thus they were in agreement with the view of the \r\n    Mu&lsquo;tazilah. This is a view that is evidently wrong, as it contradicts what \r\n    is proven in the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah, which show that reward and punishment \r\n    only come into effect after the sending of Revelation, as Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;<\/i><i>And \r\n    We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Isra&rsquo; 17:15]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, the \r\n    correct view is that the first and foremost duty of any human is to affirm \r\n    the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed), may He be glorified and exalted, and to \r\n    enter His religion, not to merely know that there is a Creator, because that \r\n    is something which Allah has instilled in the innate nature of all \r\n    creatures.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the \r\n    Maturidis, the concept of Tawheed means affirming that Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, is One in His essence and indivisible; One in His attributes, and \r\n    there is nothing like Him; and One in His actions and no one plays a part \r\n    with Him in creation. Hence they did their utmost to prove this \r\n    understanding of Tawheed, which is based on the idea that God, in their \r\n    view, is the One Who is able to create, using the rational and philosophical \r\n    arguments and analogies that were produced by the Mu&lsquo;tazilah and Jahmis. \r\n    This is evidence that was refuted by the salaf and imams (leading scholars) \r\n    and their followers, and by the prominent scholars of kalaam and philosophy, \r\n    who pointed out that the proof presented in the Qur&rsquo;an is more sound.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maturidis \r\n    affirmed only eight attributes of Allah, may He be exalted, although they \r\n    differed on some of the details thereof. These attributes are: life, power, \r\n    knowledge, will, hearing, seeing, speech and being a Creator.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Other attributes \r\n    that are indicated by the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah, the sifaat khabariyyah \r\n    (attributes that are based on texts and cannot be proven by rational \r\n    thought, such as the divine Countenance, Hand and so on, that have to do \r\n    with His Essence or His actions), cannot &ndash; in their view &ndash; be proven on the \r\n    basis of rational thinking, therefore they denied all of them, and they \r\n    misinterpreted the texts that refer to them.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ahl as-Sunnah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah, on the other hand, believe in the divine names and also in \r\n    the divine attributes, and they regard them all as <i>tawqeefi<\/i> (i.e., \r\n    they are to be learned solely from the texts and not through rational \r\n    thought). They believe in them (the divine names and attributes) by \r\n    affirming what is mentioned in the texts, without likening Him to any of His \r\n    creation. They declare Allah to be above any shortcomings or any similarity \r\n    to His creation in any way, without denying or misinterpreting any of His \r\n    names or attributes, and they delegate knowledge of the nature of these \r\n    attributes to Him, affirming His attributes in a manner that befits Allah, \r\n    may He be exalted. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;<\/i><i>There \r\n    is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer&rdquo; \r\n    [ash-Shoora 42:11]<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Their (the \r\n    Maturidis&rsquo;) view that the true words of Allah are His &ldquo;self-talk&rdquo; that is \r\n    ever present with Him, and that it is not heard, and that whatever is heard \r\n    is nothing but an outward manifestation of His eternal self-talk led them to \r\n    the conclusion that whatever Mushafs are in circulation among the people are \r\n    to be regarded as created. Thus they ended up embracing the view of the \r\n    Mu&lsquo;tazilah, which is contrary to scholarly consensus; there are abundant \r\n    reports from the scholars that this view is wrong and, in fact, the one who \r\n    says that the Qur&rsquo;an is created is to be deemed a kaafir (disbeliever).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maturidis say \r\n    concerning the definition of faith that it is belief in the heart only. Some \r\n    of them added that it is verbal affirmation, but they do not believe that it \r\n    may increase or decrease. They also said that it is haram to say &ldquo;In sha \r\n    Allah (if Allah wills)&rdquo; with regard to being a believer, and that Islam and \r\n    eemaan (faith) are synonymous, with no difference between them. Thus they \r\n    are in agreement with the Murji&rsquo;ah on that score, and they differed with Ahl \r\n    as-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah, because faith, according to the latter, is belief \r\n    in the heart, words on the lips and physical actions; it increases when one \r\n    does acts of obedience and decreases when one sins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They affirmed that \r\n    (the believers) will see Allah, may He be exalted, in the hereafter, but \r\n    they denied any direction and any face to face meeting. This is a \r\n    contradictory view as it affirms something and then goes back and denies its \r\n    reality.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more \r\n    information on this topic, please see:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <i>\r\n    al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Muyassarah fi&rsquo;l-Adyaan wa&rsquo;l-Madhaahib \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Ahzaab al-Mu&lsquo;aasirah<\/i>, \r\n    1\/95-106<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <i>\r\n    al-Maatureediyyah<\/i> \r\n    &ndash; Master&rsquo;s thesis, Ahmad ibn &lsquo;Awad-Allah al-Luhaybi al-Harbi<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <i>\r\n    al-Maatureediyyah wa Mawqifuhum min Tawheed al-Asma&rsquo; \r\n    wa&rsquo;s-Sifaat<\/i>, \r\n    Master&rsquo;s thesis, Shams al-Afghaani as-Salafi<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <i>\r\n    Manhaj al-Maatureediyyah fi&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Aqeedah<\/i>, \r\n    Dr. Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Khamees<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <i>\r\n    Al-Istiqaamah<\/i> \r\n    by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <i>\r\n    Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa wa Rasaa&rsquo;il al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    3\/307-308&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It cannot be said \r\n    regarding the follower of Maturidi &lsquo;aqeedah that he will go to Paradise or \r\n    go to Hell; rather they are like other ordinary Muslims; even though they \r\n    believe in some innovated views, their innovation (bid&lsquo;ah) does not \r\n    constitute kufr.

Thus because of \r\n    that they developed views that Muslims of knowledge and religious commitment \r\n    had to object to. Because of that, people divided into two groups concerning \r\n    them:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people \r\n    respected them, because of their good qualities and virtues; others \r\n    condemned them because of the views that they developed on the basis of \r\n    innovation and falsehood.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the best \r\n    approach in all matters is the middle approach (i.e., being fair and \r\n    acknowledging both good and bad).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The errors that \r\n    they fell into are not limited to these people only; other people of \r\n    knowledge and religious commitment also fell into similar errors. Allah, may \r\n    He be exalted, accepts good deeds from all His believing slaves, and He \r\n    overlooks their bad deeds:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Our \r\n    Lord!

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The commentators also differed concerning the reason behind \r\n    the use of the words <i>sanah<\/i> and <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i> (both meaning &ldquo;year&rdquo;). \r\n    There are two opinions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the commentators are of the view that it is a \r\n    stylistic reason only, because repeating the same word is heavy on the \r\n    tongue, so a different word was used the second time, namely &lsquo;aam, to make \r\n    it lighter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Az-Zamakhshari said in <i>al-Kashshaaf<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you say: why is the word <i>sanah<\/i> used the first time \r\n    and the word <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i> used the second time? I would answer by saying that \r\n    repeating the same word in a single phrase should be avoided in the \r\n    interests of eloquence, unless that is done for a purpose, such as for \r\n    emphasis or exaggeration or highlighting a point, and the like. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Something similar is mentioned in <i>at-Tahreer wa&rsquo;t-Tanweer<\/i>, \r\n    20\/146&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The word <i>sanah<\/i> (year) is used to highlight the \r\n    difficulty of the years that Nooh (peace be upon him) spent calling his \r\n    people. They were years of paucity in terms of goodness, rain and blessing \r\n    (barakah), and in terms of the difficulty that Nooh (peace be upon him) \r\n    encountered in calling his people, as they responded by turning away and \r\n    persecuting&nbsp; him. Then after the flood and the destruction of kufr on earth, \r\n    he spent years of abundance and ease. The Arabs refer to times of drought \r\n    and famine as <i>sanah<\/i> and times of ease and plenty as <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ar-Raaghib al-Asfahaani said in <i>Mufradaat Alfaaz al-Qur&rsquo;an<\/i> \r\n    (2\/140):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i> is like the <i>sanah<\/i> (both words mean \r\n    &ldquo;year&rdquo;) but the word <i>sanah<\/i> is often used to refer to the year in \r\n    which there is hardship or drought. Hence a drought is called <i>sanah<\/i>. \r\n    The word <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i> refers to a year in which there is ease and plenty. \r\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Then thereafter \r\n    will come a year (&lsquo;aam) in which people will have abundant rain and in which \r\n    they will press (wine and oil)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Yoosuf 12:49]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and he stayed \r\n    among them a thousand years (sanah) less fifty years (&lsquo;aam)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-&lsquo;Ankaboot 29:14]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Burhaan ad-Deen al-Biqaa&lsquo;i said in <i>Nazm ad-Durar<\/i> \r\n    (14\/404):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The word sanah is used to refer in a negative manner to the \r\n    days of kufr (disbelief)&hellip; and He said &ldquo; <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i>&rdquo; to highlight the fact \r\n    that after they (the disbelievers) were drowned, Nooh&rsquo;s life became one of \r\n    ease because of the faith of the believers and the abundance of the earth. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam az-Zarkashi said something similar in <i>al-Burhaan fi \r\n    &lsquo;Uloom al-Qur&rsquo;an<\/i>, 3\/386&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars put these two opinions together because \r\n    there is no reason why these two opinion cannot be regarded as \r\n    complementary. When it comes to opinions of the commentators &ndash; so long as \r\n    they do not contradict one another &ndash; they may all be adopted, which is \r\n    preferable to rejecting some of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Aadil said in <i>al-Lubaab<\/i>, 12\/429:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here I paid attention to a subtle point, which is that \r\n    different words for &ldquo;year&rdquo; are used. In the first case it says <i>sanah<\/i> \r\n    and in the second case it says <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i>, lest the wording be too heavy \r\n    (and so that the words will flow more easily on the tongue). Moreover, the \r\n    word <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i> is used specifically with regard to the fifty years, so as \r\n    to highlight that when the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) was rid of them, he enjoyed good times after that. The Arabs refer \r\n    to abundance by saying <i>&lsquo;aam<\/i> and to drought by saying <i>sanah<\/i>. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answers to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]10470[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]10551[\\fatin]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best. <\/p>\t\t<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"11289","question_id":"20990","answers":"<br \/><br \/>Source:"}]
