If he \r\n    does the farewell tawaaf then stays in Makkah after his tawaaf, his tawaaf \r\n    is invalidated and he must do it again when he is going to leave, unless he \r\n    stays in Makkah after the farewell tawaaf to load his luggage or wait for \r\n    his companions, in which case it does not matter. But if he stays overnight \r\n    in Makkah after doing the farewell tawaaf, then he must do tawaaf once again \r\n    before he leaves. If he does not do it then he must offer a sacrifice, to be \r\n    slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed to the poor of the city.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>A questioner \r\n    is saying: we were not able to leave Makkah after doing the farewell tawaaf \r\n    because the tawaaf was at night and we had children with us, so we left \r\n    Makkah the following day.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) replied: What the one who wants to leave Makkah after \r\n    doing Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah should do is make tawaaf the last thing that he does, \r\n    because of the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him: The \r\n    people were commanded that the last thing they should do is to \r\n    circumambulate the House. But if it so happens that a man does the farewell \r\n    tawaaf on the basis that he is going to leave, but he gets distracted by \r\n    something, such as if his car needs fixing or he has to wait for his \r\n    companions, and so on, then he does not have to repeat the tawaaf. \r\n    Similarly, the scholars said that if he needs to buy something on his way, \r\n    not for the purpose of trade, then he does not have to repeat tawaaf.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>But if a \r\n    person decides after doing the farewell tawaaf to stay in Makkah overnight \r\n    until the next day, or during the day until the next night, then he must \r\n    repeat the farewell tawaaf so that it will be the last thing that he does. \r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala Darb<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) was also asked: We hear many people saying that the one \r\n    who does the farewell tawaaf should not stay overnight within the boundaries \r\n    of Makkah at all, and if he sleeps in Makkah that night, he has to \r\n    circumambulate the House again. Is this correct or not? Because that may \r\n    cause us some hardship, as we come tired and we cannot leave before we take \r\n    a rest in Makkah, and doing tawaaf again is too difficult for us because it \r\n    is too crowded with pilgrims. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp; The farewell tawaaf is the last thing that a \r\n    person should do, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;No one of you should leave until the last thing he has done \r\n    is to circumambulate the House.&rdquo; Based on that, you should prepare yourself \r\n    not to leave and not to do the farewell tawaaf until you have completed all \r\n    your business, then leave straight away.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>But it is \r\n    allowed for a person after doing the farewell tawaaf to offer a prayer, if \r\n    the time for it has begun, and to buy things on his way as he is walking. \r\n    But with regard to staying in Makkah, if he stays he has to repeat the \r\n    farewell tawaaf.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Based on this, \r\n    there is no sin on you if you left the boundaries of Makkah and then stopped \r\n    overnight on the road and rested, then carried on with your journey.

If he cannot afford that, then he must fast for ten days, as is \r\n    the well-known view of Imam Ahmad. Some scholars are of the view that he \r\n    does not have to do anything in that case, because there is no report of \r\n    doing anything in the event of omitting an obligatory part of Hajj except \r\n    offering a sacrifice. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after discussing in detail \r\n    the ruling on one who omits an obligatory part of Hajj:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In that case \r\n    we say to the one who omitted an obligatory part: offer a sacrifice in \r\n    Makkah and distribute its meat to the poor either by yourself or delegate \r\n    someone trustworthy to do it on your behalf. If you cannot do that, then \r\n    your repentance is sufficient and you do not need to fast. This is our view \r\n    on this issue.

What is the ruling on the things she did that are \r\n    forbidden in ihraam?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: This action is \r\n    not correct, because once a person starts to do Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah, it is haraam \r\n    for him to cancel it unless that is for a valid shar&rsquo;i reason. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And perform properly (i.e. all the \r\n    ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad\r\n    <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>), the Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah.

This woman has to repent to \r\n    Allaah for what she has done, but her &lsquo;umrah is valid, because even though \r\n    she cancelled her &lsquo;umrah, &lsquo;umrah cannot be cancelled, and this is something \r\n    that applies only to Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah. If the person who is doing &lsquo;umrah \r\n    decides during the &lsquo;umrah to cancel it, it is not cancelled, or if he \r\n    decides to cancel Hajj whilst he is getting dressed for Hajj, it is not \r\n    cancelled.

The individual has two choices: either to give money to these \r\n    companies or to sacrifice it himself and leave it on the ground, in which \r\n    case neither he nor anyone else will benefit from it. If the person is able \r\n    to slaughter his hadiy and eat from it, give some of it as a gift and give \r\n    some of it in charity, then undoubtedly this is much better. This is \r\n    possible for some people who have acquaintances in Makkah and are able to \r\n    delegate them to do this on their behalf, telling them: Slaughter the hadiy \r\n    on our behalf. In that case he can benefit from it, or he can go to Makkah, \r\n    go to the slaughterhouse and buy an animal and slaughter it there, and he \r\n    will find people crowding around him to take it from him. But what I think \r\n    is a serious mistake is to send the cost of the sacrifice to another country \r\n    so that it can be sacrificed there. This is the thing for which there is no \r\n    basis. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to send \r\n    the sacrificial animal to Makkah to be sacrificed in Makkah. There is no \r\n    report from him, either in a saheeh (sound) or da&lsquo;eef (weak) hadeeth, that \r\n    suggests that he sent his sacrificial animal (udhiyah) to any other place; \r\n    rather he used to slaughter it in his house, and they would eat from it, \r\n    give some of it as gifts and give some as charity.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>End quote from <i>\r\n    al-Liqa&rsquo; ash-Shahri<\/i>, 34\/17&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If the company \r\n    writes down the name of the person on whose behalf the sacrifice is being \r\n    offered, and hangs it around the sheep&rsquo;s neck, as some companies do, and the \r\n    slaughterer forms the intention that this sacrifice is on behalf of the \r\n    person whose name is written on this paper, then that is acceptable and \r\n    valid.

This is the view of the Hanafis and Ibn Hazm, and was the \r\n    view favoured by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) among later scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/21; <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, 22\/148&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if you did this &lsquo;umrah before you reached \r\n    puberty, you do not have to do anything.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it was after you reached puberty, and you did a complete \r\n    &lsquo;umrah after that, then the complete &lsquo;umrah will suffice for the one that \r\n    was incomplete. That is because your ihram for the second &lsquo;umrah was \r\n    superfluous, because you were already in ihram, so the saa&rsquo;i and cutting the \r\n    hair count towards the first &lsquo;umrah, and thus your obligations have been \r\n    discharged.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We asked Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allaah \r\n    preserve him) about a woman who did &lsquo;umrah and forgot to cut her hair, then \r\n    she went and entered ihram for another &lsquo;umrah and did tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i and \r\n    cut her hair. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: Overlapping two &lsquo;umrahs is not correct according \r\n    to the fuqaha&rsquo; of the Muslims, so the second &lsquo;umrah is superfluous, and her \r\n    cutting her hair counts towards the first &lsquo;umrah.

The duties themselves are not waived. So \r\n    if a person owes prayer, expiations and other rights of Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, they are not waived, because they are duties, not sins; rather the \r\n    sin is delaying them. So the delay is waived by Hajj, but the duty itself is \r\n    not. If he delays it after that, the sin is renewed. So an accepted Hajj \r\n    brings forgiveness for the sin of non-compliance, but does not waive the \r\n    duties themselves. This was stated in <i>al-Mawaahib<\/i>.

If we say that it expiates everything, that does not mean, as many \r\n    people think, that debts are waived thereby. The same applies to making up \r\n    prayers, fasts and zakaah because no one says that. Rather what is meant is \r\n    that the sin of delaying payment of the debt is waived, but if after \r\n    standing in &lsquo;Arafah he delays paying it, he is sinning now. The same applies \r\n    to delaying prayers until after the time for them has ended. The sin is \r\n    erased by means of Hajj but the duty to make them up is not waived. \r\n    Moreover, after standing in &lsquo;Arafah, he is still required to make them up, \r\n    and if he does not do so, he is now a sinner according to the view of those \r\n    who say that he should make them up immediately. And the same applies to \r\n    other actions by analogy. To sum up, no one suggested that the hadeeths \r\n    which speak of the expiation of sin by virtue of Hajj are general in \r\n    meaning, as is clear.

If you want to appoint someone to do Hajj on \r\n    behalf of your deceased father or mother, then you have to choose someone \r\n    whose knowledge and religious commitment you trust, because many people are \r\n    very ignorant about the rulings on Hajj and they do not do Hajj in the \r\n    proper manner, even though they may be trustworthy in and of themselves, but \r\n    they think that this is what is required of them and they make many \r\n    mistakes. Such people should not be appointed to do Hajj on behalf of \r\n    others, because of their lack of knowledge. And some people may have \r\n    knowledge but they are not trustworthy, so you see them not caring about \r\n    what they do or say during rituals of Hajj, because they are not trustworthy \r\n    and are lacking in religious commitment.

This is what is \r\n    preferable, because entering ihram for Hajj before the months of Hajj have \r\n    begun is makrooh, because it is entering ihram for it before its time has \r\n    come.

That is in addition to having \r\n    enough to cover the expenses of those on whom he is obliged to spend until \r\n    he returns from Hajj. A woman should also have a husband or mahram with her \r\n    when travelling for Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah. Ends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it is essential that the money which one uses to travel to \r\n    the Sacred House is money that is surplus to one&rsquo;s basic needs, financial \r\n    shar&rsquo;i obligations, and any debts that may need to be paid off. Debts here \r\n    refers to duties that one owes to Allaah, such as expiations, and the rights \r\n    of other people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person owes a debt and he cannot afford both to perform \r\n    Hajj and pay off the debt, then he should start by paying off the debt, and \r\n    Hajj is not obligatory for him. Some people think that the reason is that \r\n    the lender has not given him permission and that if he asks him for \r\n    permission and he gives it, there is nothing wrong with that. Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen said (in al-<i>Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/30): There is no basis for \r\n    this notion, rather the reason is his being under an obligation. Ends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the lender gives the debtor permission to go for Hajj then \r\n    the debtor still owes the money, and his obligation is not discharged by him \r\n    being given this permission. Hence it is said to the debtor: Pay off the \r\n    debt first, then if you have enough money left to perform Hajj, do so, \r\n    otherwise Hajj is not obligatory for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a debtor who did not perform Hajj because of debt dies, he \r\n    will meet Allaah with his Islam complete and he will not be regarded as \r\n    neglectful or heedless, because Hajj was not obligatory for him. Just as \r\n    zakaah is not obligatory for one who is poor, the same applies to Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he gives Hajj priority over paying off his debt and he \r\n    dies before paying off the debt, then he will have made a mistake. If a \r\n    martyr is forgiven everything except debt, then what about anyone other than \r\n    a martyr?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by shar&rsquo;i financial obligations is expenditure \r\n    that is required by sharee&rsquo;ah, such as spending on oneself and one&rsquo;s family, \r\n    without being extravagant or wasteful. If a person is of average means but \r\n    he wants to look like he is rich, so he buys an expensive car to compete \r\n    with rich people, and he does not have enough money to perform Hajj, then he \r\n    has to sell the car and use that money to perform Hajj, and he should buy a \r\n    car that suits his means. His spending on this car is not a legitimate \r\n    shar&rsquo;i expense, rather it is a kind of extravagance, which is forbidden in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What matters in spending is that he should have enough to \r\n    provide for himself and his family until he returns from Hajj, and he should \r\n    have enough after he returns to cover his own expenses and those of the \r\n    people under his care, such as rent, salaries and business, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So he does not have to perform Hajj with the capital of his \r\n    business, from the profit of which he spends on himself and his family, if \r\n    that reduction of his capital will result in a reduction of his profits \r\n    which will mean that there will not be enough to provide for himself and his \r\n    family.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee (11\/36) was asked about a man who had \r\n    a sum of money in an Islamic bank and his salary, along with the returns \r\n    from his investment, is sufficient for him to live a moderate lifestyle. \r\n    Does he have to perform Hajj using that capital, knowing that this will \r\n    affect his monthly income and standard of living?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your situation is as described then you are not obliged to \r\n    perform Hajj because you are not able to do so according to the criteria \r\n    stipulated in sharee&rsquo;ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And Hajj (pilgrimage to \r\n    Makkah) to the House (Ka&lsquo;bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those \r\n    who can afford the expenses&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:97]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;and [Allaah] has not \r\n    laid upon you in religion any hardship&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>[al-Hajj 22:78]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by basic needs is that which a person needs a \r\n    great deal in his life and which it is too hard for him to do without, such \r\n    as books for a seeker of knowledge. We would not tell him to sell his books \r\n    and use that money to perform Hajj, because they are basic needs for him. \r\n    The same applies to a car that a person needs; we would not tell him to sell \r\n    it and use the money to perform Hajj.

Just as no \r\n    one should appoint another person to fast on his behalf &ndash; even though if he \r\n    died and still owed obligatory fasts, his heir should fast them on his \r\n    behalf &ndash; the same applies to Hajj; Hajj is an act of worship that a person \r\n    should do himself and it is not an act of charity for the benefit of someone \r\n    else. If an act of worship is a physical action that the person should do \r\n    himself, it is not valid for someone else to do it on his behalf except in \r\n    cases mentioned in the Sunnah, and there is no report in the Sunnah about \r\n    anyone performing a naafil Hajj on behalf of someone else. This is one of \r\n    the two opinions narrated from Ahmad, i.e., that it is not valid for a \r\n    person to appoint someone else to perform a naafil Hajj or &lsquo;umrah on his \r\n    behalf, whether he is able to do that or not.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>By expressing \r\n    this opinion, we want to encourage those who are well of and physically able \r\n    to perform Hajj themselves, because some people let years go by without \r\n    going to Makkah, relying on the idea of sending someone to perform Hajj on \r\n    their behalf every year, so they miss out on doing Hajj on the grounds that \r\n    they are appointing others to perform Hajj on their behalf.

This is because Islam places \r\n    a great emphasis on protecting people&rsquo;s rights and is keen for the spirit of \r\n    love and friendship to remain among them, so that none of them will consume \r\n    the wealth of others or transgress against them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the following question:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I owe money to a number of \r\n    people. Can I go to Makkah to fast there with my children, noting that I \r\n    will be able to share the cost of rent with my children?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>His answer was as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I will ask you a question: \r\n    is charity better, or the zakaah that is obligatory? Zakaah is better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Is a voluntary act better, \r\n    or an obligatory one? The obligatory one is better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Is it logical to start with \r\n    the obligatory action before the voluntary one, or vice versa? Reason \r\n    dictates that I should start with the obligatory action before the voluntary \r\n    one. So it is not permissible for a person to go to Makkah to do a voluntary \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah when he is in debt. A debt must be paid off, but is a voluntary \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah obligatory? No it is not. Even the obligatory Hajj is waived in the \r\n    event of debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Religion is not based on \r\n    emotions. Even the duty that Allaah has enjoined upon His slaves, which is \r\n    to go on Hajj to the Ka&rsquo;bah and to do &lsquo;Umrah, if a person is in debt, it is \r\n    waived in his case, and he will meet his Lord without sin. If a man is in \r\n    debt and he does not do Hajj and it is said that he has not done the \r\n    obligatory duty, we say that the words &ldquo;has not done the obligatory duty&rdquo; \r\n    are mistaken. Why is this a mistake? Because there was no obligation upon \r\n    him, and there is no obligation upon him until now. Hajj is only an \r\n    obligation for the one who is free of debt.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence we say to this \r\n    brother: Don&rsquo;t be hard on yourself, keep your money, stay in your country, \r\n    and save the money in order to pay off your debt. Do not be like the one who \r\n    built a castle and destroyed a country. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We think that this brother \r\n    has to stay in his own country.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Yes, if it so happens that \r\n    someone offers him money to cover all the expenses and he says Do not give \r\n    me even a single dirham &ndash; in that case we say: If his travelling for &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    will not affect his work through which he earns money, then he should go, \r\n    because in this case will it affect his creditor or not? No it will not. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If someone says to him, I \r\n    know that you owe ten thousand riyals, and I know that debt must be given \r\n    precedence over voluntary acts of worship, but come with me, you and your \r\n    family, for free, there and back &ndash; can he go with him? In this case we say: \r\n    If he has a job and his absence from work will cause him a loss in salary, \r\n    then he should not go. But if he does not have a job, and going with him \r\n    will not affect anything, then there is nothing wrong with him going with \r\n    him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It makes no difference \r\n    whether the debt is due now or later. But if it is deferred, and he knows \r\n    that when the time comes he will be able to pay it off, then it does not \r\n    matter, like a man who owes money that is due in two months time, for \r\n    example, and he knows that when the time comes he will be able to pay it off \r\n    &ndash; in that case we say: Go, because staying in his country will not make a \r\n    difference to the creditor.

So \r\n    how can it not be permissible for her to postpone Hajj if she fears for her \r\n    child? If she fears for her child, then what she must do is stay, then when \r\n    he is older she can do Hajj next year.

And it was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) say when he was delivering a khutbah: &ldquo;No man should be \r\n    alone with a woman unless she has a mahram present, and no woman should \r\n    travel except with a mahram.&rdquo; A man stood up and said: My wife has gone out \r\n    for Hajj and I have enlisted for such and such a campaign.

As for merely speaking to a patient or a teacher of \r\n    medicine, that is not haraam, rather what is haraam is making the voice soft \r\n    and appealing when speaking to him, which may tempt those in whose heart is \r\n    the sickness of evil and hypocrisy.

In that case there is nothing to prevent that on condition \r\n\tthat the first mahram takes her to the airport and does not leave her until \r\n\tshe boards the plane, and he contacts the country to which she is headed and \r\n\tmakes sure that her mahrams there will meet her in the airport, and he tells \r\n\tthem the time of arrival and the flight number.

But the majority say that if he goes \r\n    back to his family &ndash; and some of them say that if he travels a short distance &ndash; then comes back for Hajj on its own, then he is not doing \r\n    tamattu&rsquo;. It seems, and Allaah knows best, that the most correct view is that which was narrated from &lsquo;Umar and his son (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them both), which is that if he goes back to his family, then he is not doing tamattu&rsquo;, and he does not have to offer a sacrifice. But for \r\n    the one who came to do Hajj and did &lsquo;Umrah and then stayed in Jeddah or al-Ta&rsquo;if, and he is not one of their people, then he entered ihraam, this \r\n    person is doing tamattu&rsquo;, and the fact that he went to al-Ta&rsquo;if or Jeddah or Madeenah does not mean that he is no longer doing tamattu&rsquo;, because \r\n    he came to perform them (&lsquo;Umrah and Hajj) together, and he only went to Jeddah or al-Ta&rsquo;if for a reason. The same applies to one who goes to visit \r\n    Madeenah &ndash; this does not mean that he is no longer doing tamattu&rsquo; according to the most obvious and most correct view. So he has to offer the \r\n    sacrifice of tamattu&rsquo; and do saa&rsquo;i for Hajj just as he did saa&rsquo;i for &lsquo;Umrah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, 17\/96&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> (17\/98) it also says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he comes back in ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah &ndash; i.e., on his second trip &ndash; and exits ihraam then stays \r\n    until he does Hajj, this is tamattu&rsquo;. His first &lsquo;Umrah does not mean that he was doing tamattu&rsquo;, according to the majority, but the second &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    which he did and then stayed in Makkah until he does Hajj means that he is now doing tamattu&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the pilgrim who is doing tamattu&rsquo; goes back to his city then sets out again from his city \r\n    to do Hajj, then he is doing ifraad, because of the interval between &lsquo;Umrah and Hajj that occurred when he went back to his family. His setting \r\n    out means that he is embarking on a new journey to do Hajj, so in this case his Hajj is ifraad. So he does not have to offer a sacrifice in this \r\n    case, but if he does this as a trick to try to avoid having to offer a sacrifice, then he is not relieved of that obligation, because trying to \r\n    use tricks to avoid doing an obligatory duty does not mean that one is relieved thereof, just as trying to use tricks to do something haraam does \r\n    not make it permissible. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i>, p. 524.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7104","question_id":"7104","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person does &lsquo;umrah in Shawaal and stays in Makkah, then \r\n    does Hajj in the same year, he is doing tamattu&rsquo; and has to offer a \r\n    sacrifice,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That is because tamattu&rsquo; means &ldquo;entering ihraam for &lsquo;umrah \r\n    during the months of Hajj and finishing it, then entering ihraam for Hajj in \r\n    the same year.&rdquo; The months of Hajj are: Shawwaal, Dhu&rsquo;l-Qa&rsquo;dah and the first \r\n    ten days of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he travels between &lsquo;umrah and Hajj, then there is a \r\n    difference of opinion among the scholars; the correct view is that if he \r\n    goes back to his own city or country then he has cancelled out tamattu&rsquo;, but \r\n    if he travels to somewhere other than his own city or country, his tamattu&rsquo; \r\n    remains in effect, and if he does Hajj in the same year, he must offer the \r\n    sacrifice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was \r\n    asked: I did the rituals of &lsquo;umrah in Shawwaal 1395 AH, and after doing that \r\n    I went back to my own town, and I have decided, in sha Allaah, to do the \r\n    obligatory Hajj this year, 1395 AH.

He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the intention was changed before entering ihram, then \r\n    there is nothing wrong with that. But if it was after entering ihram, then \r\n    their Hajj became qiraan and not ifraad. What is meant by it being qiraan is \r\n    that they joined Hajj with &lsquo;umrah, because qiraan takes two forms:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When the pilgrim enters ihram \r\n    for Hajj and &lsquo;umrah together when he first enters ihram<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When he enters ihram for &lsquo;umrah \r\n    first, then joins Hajj to it before starting tawaaf.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, so long as you entered ihram for &lsquo;umrah first, then you decided to make it Hajj, you were doing qiraan. If you slaughtered a hadiy on Eid al-Adha during your Hajj in that year, then you have done what was required of you and have completed your Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah. If you did not slaughter a hadiy, then you have to do so now, and eat some of it and give the rest in charity. If any of you cannot find a hadiy &ndash; i.e., cannot afford to buy one &ndash; then he must fast for ten days now.

When entering \r\n    ihraam for Hajj he should do what he did when entering ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah: \r\n    ghusl (full ablution), putting on perfume and praying. He should form the \r\n    intention of entering ihraam for Hajj and recite the Talbiyah. The Talbiyah \r\n    for Hajj is the same as the Talbiyah for &lsquo;Umrah, except that one should say \r\n    here &ldquo;<i>Labbayka hajjan<\/i> (Here I am for Hajj)&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;<i>Labbayka \r\n    &lsquo;umratan<\/i> (Here I am for &lsquo;Umrah).&rdquo; If he fears that some obstacle may \r\n    prevent him from completing Hajj, he should stipulate a condition and say: \r\n    &ldquo;If something prevents me (from completing Hajj) I will exit ihraam at the \r\n    point where I am prevented (from continuing).&rdquo; If he is not afraid of any \r\n    obstacle then he does not need to stipulate any condition.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Then he should go to Mina and stay there overnight, and \r\n    offer five prayers there: Zuhr, &lsquo;Asr, Maghrib, &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; and Fajr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; When the sun rises on the ninth day he should proceed to \r\n    &lsquo;Arafah and pray Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr together there, shortened, at the time of \r\n    Zuhr. Then he should strive in du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, dhikr and prayers for forgiveness \r\n    until the sun sets.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; When the sun sets, he should proceed to Muzdalifah and \r\n    pray Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; there when he arrives.

It is better \r\n    to delay and stay longer, but it is not obligatory unless the sun sets on \r\n    the twelfth and one is still in Mina, in which case it becomes obligatory to \r\n    stay until one stones the three jamaraat after the sun passes its zenith. \r\n    But if the sun sets on the twelfth day and a person is still in Mina but not \r\n    by choice, such as if he had packed his bags and got into the bus or truck, \r\n    but was delayed because of overcrowding and traffic jams, then he does not \r\n    have to stay, because his staying until after sunset was involuntary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    11 &ndash; Once those days are over and the pilgrim wants to leave, \r\n    he must not leave until he has performed the farewell tawaaf, going around \r\n    the Ka&rsquo;bah seven times. Women who are menstruating or bleeding following \r\n    childbirth d o not have to do this farewell tawaaf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    12 &ndash; If the pilgrim is performing a voluntary Hajj on behalf \r\n    of another person, whether a relative or otherwise, then he has to have done \r\n    Hajj for himself before that. There is no difference in the way he performs \r\n    Hajj apart from the intention, i.e., he should form the intention of \r\n    performing this Hajj on behalf of that person, mentioning him by name in the \r\n    Talbiyah and saying, &ldquo;Labbayk &lsquo;an [fulaan] (Here I am on behalf of [So and \r\n    so]).&rdquo; Then when he says du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; during the rituals he should pray for \r\n    himself and for the person on whose behalf he is performing Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the types of Hajj, there are three: tamattu&rsquo;, \r\n    qiraan and ifraad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Tamattu&rsquo; is when the pilgrim enters ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah during \r\n    the months of Hajj (which are Shawwaal, Dhu&rsquo;l-Qa&rsquo;dah and the first ten days \r\n    of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah) and performs &lsquo;Umrah and exits ihraam, then he enters ihraam \r\n    again for Hajj from Makkah or its environs on the day of al-Tarwiyah (the \r\n    eighth day of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah) in the same year as his &lsquo;Umrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Qiraan is when the pilgrim enters ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah and Hajj \r\n    together, and does not exit ihraam until the day of Sacrifice, or he enters \r\n    ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah then includes Hajj with it before he starts his tawaaf.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ifraad is when the pilgrim enters ihraam for Hajj from the \r\n    meeqaat or from Makkah if he resides there or in a place that is closer than \r\n    the meeqaat, and remains in ihraam until the Day of Sacrifice if he has a \r\n    hadiy with him. If he does not have a hadiy with him, it is prescribed for \r\n    him to cancel his Hajj and make it &lsquo;Umrah, so he should perform tawaaf and \r\n    saa&rsquo;i, then cut his hair and exit ihraam, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told those who entered ihraam for Hajj but \r\n    did not have a hadiy with them to do.

And Mujaahid said: Everyone who \r\n    disobeys his Lord is ignorant until he gives up his sin. (<i>Tafseer \r\n    al-Tabari<\/i>, 8\/89).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In addition to \r\n    ignorance of what is required of a person, namely honouring the Symbols of \r\n    Allaah and adhering to His limits and not transgressing them, knowledge \r\n    should be sought in order to act upon it, not to try to find ways to avoid \r\n    doing that which Allaah has enjoined and transgress the sacred limits of \r\n    Allaah. Where do these people stand in the light of the words of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Whoever does Hajj for the \r\n    sake of Allaah, and does not utter any obscenity or commit any immoral \r\n    action, will go back (sinless) as on the day his mother bore him&rdquo;? \r\n    (al-Bukhaari, 1521; Muslim, 1350). Ibn Hajar said: &ldquo;or commit any immoral \r\n    action&rdquo; means that he does not do any evil deed or sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;From one &lsquo;umrah to the next is an expiation for whatever (sins) \r\n    come in between, and an accepted Hajj (Hajj mabroor) brings no less a reward \r\n    than Paradise.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 1773; Muslim, 1349.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Hajar said: Mabroor means accepted. Others said that it \r\n    means that with which no sin is mixed; al-Nawawi regarded this as being more \r\n    correct. Al-Qurtubi said: the interpretations that have been suggested are \r\n    close in meaning, which is that it is the Hajj that is in accordance with \r\n    the rulings and fulfills all the requirements in the most complete manner. \r\n    And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But here there is some confusion. Perhaps this is the reason \r\n    why some people do this, i.e., they think that a person has the choice \r\n    between either doing what is obligatory and avoiding what is forbidden, or \r\n    offering the required fidyah which is either fasting, giving charity or \r\n    offering a sacrifice. Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said, after mentioning some of \r\n    the things that are forbidden and the fidyah required for them:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we have said here applies to what is required of the one \r\n    who does this. But this does not mean that the matter is easy or lenient in \r\n    the sense that if he wishes he may do this thing then offer the expiation \r\n    and make it up, and if he wishes he may not do it. Rather the matter is more \r\n    difficult than that, indeed it is a very serious matter, when one dares to \r\n    transgress the limits of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming \r\n    Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor \r\n    commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:197]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to a \r\n    matter in which some people think that they have the option of not doing \r\n    what is obligatory and offering the fidyah instead.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people think that when the scholars said that for not \r\n    doing an obligatory duty (of Hajj) a sacrifice must be offered, that this \r\n    gives them the choice between doing that obligatory action or of offering \r\n    this sacrifice and distributing its meat to the poor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>For example, some people \r\n    think: &ldquo;When the day of Eid comes, I will do tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i, then go home. \r\n    But I should still stay overnight in Mina and stone the Jamaraat &ndash; which are \r\n    two of the obligatory actions of Hajj &ndash; so I will offer fidyah for both of \r\n    them by sacrificing a sheep&hellip;&rdquo; but this is not the way it is. If it so \r\n    happens that a person does that, then the fidyah is an expiation for him, \r\n    but he must repent and seek forgiveness too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Fataawa<\/i> 22\/168-169.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7113","question_id":"7113","answers":"<\/p>\r\n    <p><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      <span>\r\n      Praise\r\n      be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is better for a person not to pin his rida&rsquo; (upper garment); rather he should wear it over his shoulders.

What this means is that the muhrim may wear \r\n    anything other than these five things.

Whatever we \r\n    are uncertain about, the basic principle is that it is permissible. One of \r\n    the things we are uncertain about is the sewn lower garment (izaar).

(<i>al-Faqeeh \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Mutafaqqih<\/i> by al-Baghdaadi, 45). Hence Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) included a chapter in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> entitled: <i>Baab \r\n    al-&lsquo;ilm qabla al-&lsquo;qawl wa&rsquo;l-&lsquo;aml<\/i> (Learning before speaking and acting).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;This does not mean that everyone has to memorize by heart a \r\n    book that discusses the rituals of Hajj, rather what every Muslim must do is \r\n    to learn whatever he needs to know, according to his situation, either by \r\n    himself, if he is qualified to do so, or by asking scholars, or by \r\n    accompanying someone who can show him what to do and teach him whatever he \r\n    should do whenever he needs to know.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the things that are forbidden during ihraam, \r\n    these have been explained in the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]11356[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if a person does one of these things out of ignorance \r\n    that Allaah had forbidden that when one is in a state of ihraam, then he \r\n    does not have to do anything (i.e., offer fidyah etc), because Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And there is no sin on \r\n    you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what \r\n    your hearts deliberately intend.

As for the \r\n    one who was unaware of the consequences of doing this action, that is not an \r\n    excuse. Hence if a married man knew that zina is haraam, and he is an adult \r\n    of sound mind and he was married or previously-married, but he went ahead \r\n    and committed zina, then he must be stoned. If he says, &lsquo;I did not know that \r\n    the hadd punishment (for zina) is stoning, and if I had known that the hadd \r\n    punishment is stoning I would not have done it,&rsquo; then we say to him that \r\n    this is not an excuse, and you must be stoned, even if you did not know what \r\n    the consequences of zina are.

This indicates that if a person \r\n    commits a sin and transgresses the sacred limits of Allaah, then he must \r\n    face the consequences of that sin, even if he did not know of its effects \r\n    when he did it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Fataawa<\/i> 22\/173-174.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7134","question_id":"7134","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Tawaaf is one of the essential pillars of &lsquo;Umrah, which is \r\n    not valid without it.

And because the basic principle is that wudoo&rsquo; remains valid and one remains pure. Hence it is know that if a person&rsquo;s \r\n    body touches a woman&rsquo;s body in tawaaf, his tawaaf is still valid. The same applies to wudoo&rsquo;; if he touches his wife or kisses her, his wudoo&rsquo; is \r\n    still valid so long as nothing comes out of him.

The obligatory etiquette means that \r\n    the traveller should fulfil all the obligations and pillars (essential \r\n    parts) of Hajj, and avoid the things that are forbidden in ihraam in \r\n    particular, and the things that are forbidden in general, whether they are \r\n    forbidden in ihraam or when not in ihraam, because Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) \r\n    months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the \r\n    12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days).

There are also other points of etiquette that has \r\n    to do with the act of worship, such as doing Hajj in the most perfect manner \r\n    and striving to do it with the proper etiquette in both word and deed.

How could it be otherwise when Allaah commanded \r\n    Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) to build it and venerate it?<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When he drinks the water of \r\n    Zamzam, this reminds him of the blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon \r\n    people in this blessed water, from which millions of people have drunk for \r\n    many centuries, and it still has not dried up. He is encouraged to say \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; (supplication) when drinking it, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The water of Zamzam is for whatever \r\n    it is drunk for.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Maajah (3062) and Ahmad (14435). It is a \r\n    hasan hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) in <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> (4\/320).<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10-<span>The saa&rsquo;i (running) \r\n    between al-Safa and al-Marwa reminds him of the great hardship undergone by \r\n    our mother Haajar (Hagar), and how she ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa \r\n    looking for someone to save her from the trouble in which she found herself, \r\n    and especially for water to give to her young son Ismaa&rsquo;eel (Ishmael). This \r\n    woman bore this test with patience, and turned to her Lord. In her we have a \r\n    good example, because when a man remembers the striving and patience of this \r\n    woman, his problems seem less significant, and when a woman remembers one of \r\n    her own gender, her hardship becomes easier to bear.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    11-<span>Standing in &lsquo;Arafah \r\n    reminds the pilgrim of the great gathering of mankind on the Day of \r\n    Gathering.

It also teaches him to respond to the \r\n    command of Allaah, as Ismaa&rsquo;eel said: <i>&ldquo; &lsquo;O my father!

This joy can only be felt by the one \r\n    who tastes the sweetness of obedience, like the joy that the fasting person \r\n    feels when he breaks his fast, or that the one who spends the night in \r\n    prayer feels after he has prayed.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    15-<span>When he has finished \r\n    the rituals of Hajj and done them as Allaah has prescribed and as He likes, \r\n    and has completed his rituals, he has the hope that his Lord will forgive \r\n    him all his sins, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) promised when he said: &ldquo;Whoever comes to this House and does not utter \r\n    any obscene speech or do any evil deed, will go back as his mother bore \r\n    him.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1449) and Muslim (1350).

Some of them \r\n    said that others may perform Hajj on his behalf and that will benefit him, \r\n    and it will be as if he did Hajj for himself. Others said that no one can \r\n    perform Hajj on his behalf, and even if people performed Hajj on his behalf \r\n    a thousand times, it would not be accepted and would not discharge his duty. \r\n    This view is correct, because this man failed to do an act of worship that \r\n    was obligatory for him and should have been done straight away, with no \r\n    excuse. So how can we make it up for him after his death after he neglected \r\n    it? Now the estate has to do with the rights of the heirs &ndash; how can we \r\n    deprive them of the costs of this Hajj, when it is not going to be accepted? \r\n    This is what Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned in <i>\r\n    Tahdheeb al-Sunan<\/i> and this is also my view. If a person fails to do Hajj \r\n    out of negligence when he is able to do it, no Hajj will ever count for him, \r\n    even if the people do Hajj on his behalf a thousand times. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for zakaah, there are some scholars who say that if a \r\n    person dies and zakaah is paid on his behalf, that is sufficient, but the \r\n    basic principle that I have mentioned implies that it does not discharge his \r\n    duty of paying zakaah. But I think that the zakaah may be paid from the \r\n    estate, because it has to do with the rights of the poor and those who are \r\n    entitled to zakaah, unlike Hajj, the cost of which cannot be taken from the \r\n    estate, because it does not have to do with anybody&rsquo;s rights, whereas zakaah \r\n    has to do with people&rsquo;s rights. So zakaah should be given to those who are \r\n    entitled to it, but that does not discharge the person&rsquo;s duty, and he will \r\n    be given the punishment of those who do not pay zakaah. We ask Allaah to \r\n    keep us safe and sound. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to fasting. If it is known that this person \r\n    did not fast and was negligent in making it up, then it cannot be made up on \r\n    his behalf, because he was negligent and failed to do this act of worship, \r\n    which is one of the pillars of Islam, with no excuse. If it is made up on \r\n    his behalf it will not benefit him. The hadeeth of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Whoever dies owing fasts, his heir \r\n    should fast on his behalf,&rdquo; applies to one who has not been negligent, and \r\n    with regard to the one who failed to make up missed fasts out of negligence \r\n    with no legitimate shar&rsquo;i excuse, what is the point of making it up on his \r\n    behalf?

For we see usually each person travelling on his own, whereas in Hajj we see people coming in groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>10 &ndash; Getting to know the situation of the \r\n    Muslims from trustworthy sources, since the Muslim can hear directly from his brother about the situation of his Muslim brothers in the land from \r\n    which he has come.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>11 &ndash;Exchanging benefits and experience among \r\n    the Muslims in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>12 &ndash; Meeting scholars and decision makers \r\n    from all countries and studying the situation and needs of the Muslims, and the importance of cooperating with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>13 &ndash; Achieving true submission to Allaah by \r\n    standing in the holy places when the pilgrim leaves al-Masjid al-Haraam which is the best of spots, and standing in &lsquo;Arafah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>14 &ndash; Forgiveness of sins, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does Hajj and does not speak any obscene words or commit any sin will go back \r\n    cleansed of sin as on the day his mother bore him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>15 &ndash; Opening the doors of hope to those who \r\n    commit sin, and teaching them to give up their sin in these holy places, so that they will give up a lot of their bad habits during the period of \r\n    Hajj and its rituals.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>16 &ndash; Proclaiming that Islam is the religion \r\n    of organization, because during Hajj the rituals and time are organized, with every action done in the place and at the time defined for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>17 &ndash; Training oneself to spend in charitable \r\n    ways and to avoid miserliness. The pilgrim spends a great deal of money for the sake of Hajj, on travel expenses, on the road and in the sacred \r\n    places.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>18 &ndash; Increasing piety and making the heart \r\n    fit to honour the Symbols of Allaah.

This is a kind of intensive \r\n    training in worship and remembrance of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>21 &ndash; Training oneself to be kind to people &ndash; \r\n    so the pilgrim guides those who are lost, teaches those who are ignorant, helps the poor, and supports the disabled and weak.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>22 &ndash; Developing good characteristics such as \r\n    forbearance and putting up with annoyance from people, because the pilgrim will inevitably be exposed to crowding and arguments, etc. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the \r\n    well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two \r\n    months and ten days).

When Haajar the mother of Ismaa&rsquo;eel (peace be upon them both) said to Ibraaheem, &ldquo;Has Allaah \r\n    commanded you to do this?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Then He will not let us down.&rdquo; So Allaah raised high the esteem in which she was held and \r\n    the people, including the Prophets, started to run between the two hills as she had done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>26 &ndash; Teaching oneself not to despair of the \r\n    mercy of Allaah, no matter how great one's worries and distress. For the way out is in Allaah&rsquo;s hand. The mother of Ismaa&rsquo;eel thought her son was \r\n    about to die, and she started to run from one mountain to the other, looking for a solution, and it came to her from a source she could never \r\n    imagine when the angel came down and struck the ground, and out came the water of Zamzam with its healing for diseases of the heart and body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>27 &ndash; The pilgrim remembers that in doing \r\n    these rituals he is the guest of the most Merciful. The gathering of Hajj is not at the invitation of any government or organization or king or \r\n    president, rather it is the invitation of the Lord of the Worlds Who has made it an occasion on which the Muslims meet on a footing of equality in \r\n    which no one is superior to anyone else. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage).

Hence we love Him in a way that demands that we obey His \r\n    commands even if that is somewhat difficult for us. We feel proud, happy and \r\n    content when we do that which He commands us to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For if a human loves another person, he loves to serve him \r\n    and that may make him happy. So what do you think about the Almighty Lord \r\n    Who created us and grants us provision, and everything that we have is a \r\n    blessing from Him? And His is the highest description. We owe everything to \r\n    our Lord, so we must hasten to do all that He commands us to do, so that we \r\n    might give back some small thanks for His great blessings. We can never \r\n    thank Him enough, but by His grace Allaah the Most Generous accepts our \r\n    small efforts and rewards us for them greatly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example, Hajj or pilgrimage. If a Muslim does Hajj in the \r\n    manner required by his Lord, then Allaah has promised to forgive him his \r\n    sins and admit him to Paradise, on condition that he does not spoil this \r\n    action by committing any major action that would invalidate it and earn the \r\n    anger of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the great mercies that Allaah has bestowed upon this \r\n    ummah (nation, i.e., the Muslims), is that Allaah has made obedience to His \r\n    commands and the commands of His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) subject to the condition that one be able to do them. So \r\n    long as a person is able to do them, then it is obligatory for him to do \r\n    what is required of him, otherwise he is not obliged to do so and he is \r\n    excused. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:286]<\/i> &ndash; i.e., He \r\n    does not ask him to do more than he can bear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Concerning Hajj in particular, Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka&lsquo;bah) is \r\n    a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for \r\n    one&rsquo;s conveyance, provision and residence)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:97]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    By His mercy He has enjoined this upon His slaves once in a \r\n    lifetime, so that it will not be too difficult for them, but He urges those \r\n    who are able to do Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah more than once to do so. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Keep on doing Hajj and \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah, for they take away poverty and sins as the bellows takes away the \r\n    impurity from iron.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 2\/4; this is a saheeh hadeeth \r\n    as was stated by al-Albaani in <i>al-Silsilat al-Saheehah<\/i>, 1200).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This great act of worship \r\n    was prescribed by Allaah so that we might praise Him and glorify Him, and \r\n    thank Him for His great blessings and bounty. The purpose of Tawaaf around \r\n    the Ka&rsquo;bah is not simply to go around these stones! No, rather the reason is \r\n    that Allaah has commanded us to go around it seven times and we obey Allaah \r\n    by going around it seven times, no more and no less; rather we do what He \r\n    has commanded us and we feel that we are His slaves, humbling ourselves \r\n    before Him and praising Him and thanking Him for choosing us to be His \r\n    slaves out of all of mankind who worship various gods, and may even worship \r\n    themselves or their own desires.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to all the rituals of Hajj, and indeed to \r\n    all the acts of worship that Allaah has prescribed for us. Praise be to \r\n    Allaah, Who has honoured us with this great religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, your interest in asking about the Hajj at your \r\n    young age indicates that you are keen to learn and find out. We advise you \r\n    to learn more about Islam and to read about it, and to find out for yourself \r\n    that it is the religion that suits the natural inclinations of man. This \r\n    will set you on the path towards pleasing your Almighty Lord, Who created \r\n    you and Who provides for you, and Who deserves that you should worship Him \r\n    alone and none other.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps you know that our prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that his fellow-Prophet &lsquo;Eesa \r\n    (Jesus &ndash; peace be upon him) will come down at the end of time and will \r\n    perform pilgrimage to this House, and he will declare his belief in Allah \r\n    alone (Tawheed). We believe that this will happen as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us, just as we believe that the \r\n    sun rises in the morning. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the son of Maryam (the \r\n    son of Mary, i.e. Jesus) will certainly pronounce the Talbiyah for Hajj or \r\n    for &lsquo;Umrah, or for both&nbsp; in the valley of Rawha.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, \r\n    1252).

In his time, only A&#8217;ishah did this and it was due to a specific \r\n\tsituation; that is, she had the intention of performing &#8216;Umrah, but her \r\n\tmenses occurred. The Messenger of Allah ordered her to do the Hajj with \r\n\t&#8216;Umrah, and thus she performed Hajj Qiran (a type of Hajj where Hajj and \r\n\t&#8216;Umrah are done with one ihram).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>He informed her that the \r\n\ttawaf (circumambulation) around the House and walking between Safa and \r\n\tMarwah counted for both the Hajj and &#8216;Umrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>However, she felt somewhat \r\n\tupset that her friends (other women) would return having performed Hajj and \r\n\t&#8216;Umrah separately, as they performed Hajj Tamattu&#8217; and did not menstruate \r\n\tduring that time; whereas A&#8217;ishah performed Hajj Qiran and her &#8216;Umrah was \r\n\tincluded within her Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>The Messenger of Allah then \r\n\tordered A&#8217;ishah&#8217;s brother to take her out to Tan&#8217;eem, and return to Makkah \r\n\tin order to perform her &#8216;Umrah and to make her feel better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>However, he did not perform \r\n\t&#8216;Umrah from at-Tan&#8217;eem during that Hajj not did anyone else who was with \r\n\thim.&#8221; End quote&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Second:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>The majority of scholars \r\n\thave allowed one who performs &#8216;Umrah to perform another one during the same \r\n\tjourney, especially if he is from outside Makkah and it is a long journey \r\n\tand difficult to return once more.

The \r\n\tscholars said: It is incumbent to leave the sanctuary so as to combine \r\n\tbetween the area outside the sanctuary and the sanctuary as the pilgrim \r\n\tdoes, for he stands in &#8216;Arafah (which is outside the sanctuary), then enters \r\n\tMakkah for the tawaf (circumambulation) and other acts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>These are the details of \r\n\tthe Shafi&#8217;ee school of thought, and similar to this has been said by the \r\n\tmajority of scholars: That it is necessary to leave to the closest area \r\n\toutside the sanctuary to don the ihram for &#8216;Umrah, and if he were to do so \r\n\tfrom within the sanctuary and not leave, a penalty (sacrifice) would be \r\n\tbinding. &#8216;Ata said: There is nothing on him (i.e. no penalty).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Malik said: It will not \r\n\tcount until he leaves the sanctuary.

If he wants to do &#8216;Umrah, it must be \r\n\tfrom outside the sanctuary and we know of no difference of opinion in that. \r\n\tThat is why the Prophet (may Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him)ordered \r\n\t&#8216;Abdur-Rahman to make &#8216;Aishah do the &#8216;Umrah from at-Tan&#8217;eem.&#8221; End quote&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz ibn Baz \r\n\twas asked: If someone comes to Makkah for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah, then is it \r\n\tpermissible for him after that to perform another &#8216;Umrah for himself or on \r\n\tbehalf of another during the very same season he came in such that he leaves \r\n\tMakkah to at-Tan&#8217;eem for ihram and then performs the &#8216;Umrah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>He (may Allah have on him) \r\n\tresponded: &#8220;There is no harm in that, all praise is for Allah, if he came \r\n\tfor Hajj or &#8216;Umrah and performed them on his own behalf or on behalf of \r\n\tsomeone else and then wanted to perform another &#8216;Umrah for himself or on \r\n\tbehalf of someone else.There is no problem in that, but one must go outside \r\n\tthe sanctuary for it; he must go outside the sanctuary of Makkah, at-Tan&#8217;eem \r\n\tor Ji&#8217;irranah or somewhere else and don the ihram from there, then enter (Makkah) \r\n\tand do the tawaf, walk between as-Safa and al-Marwah and shorten the \r\n\thair.This is allowed whether it be for himself, a deceased relative or \r\n\tfriend or one who is incapable, such as the elderly&#8230; there is no harm in \r\n\tthat.&#8217;Aishah did this upon the instruction of the Prophet (may the peace and \r\n\tblessings of Allah be upon him), as she did &#8216;Umrah with the Prophet, then on \r\n\tthe night of the 13th she took permission to do &#8216;Umrah and he permitted her, \r\n\tordering &#8216;Abdur0Rahman ibn Abu Bakr (her brother) to take her to at-Tan&#8217;eem \r\n\tand then perform &#8216;Umrah.

Rather the Sunnah is for the pilgrim to enter ihraam from \r\n    the place where he is staying, because the Sahaabah who had exited ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah by the command of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) then entered ihraam for Hajj on the day of al-Tarwiyah, did not go to al-Masjid al-Haraam to enter ihraam from there, rather \r\n    each one of them entered ihraam from the place where he was staying. This was at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him), so this is the Sunnah. So the Sunnah for the one who wants to enter ihraam for Hajj is to enter ihraam from the place where \r\n    he is staying, whether he is in Makkah or in Mina, as some people do nowadays, when they go to Mina so that they can keep their places there.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some of the pilgrims think that it is not \r\n    proper to enter ihraam in the garments that they wore when they entered ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah, unless they wash them first. This is also a mistaken \r\n    notion, because the ihraam garments do not have to be new or clean. It is true that the cleaner they are, the better, but to say that they are not valid for ihraam because one has worn them for ihraam when performing &lsquo;Umrah is not correct. This is what springs to mind now about the mistakes made by some pilgrims with regard to entering ihraam for Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: From Daleel al-Akhta&rsquo; allati yaqa&rsquo; fiha al-Haaj wa&rsquo;l-Mu&rsquo;tamir (Guide to mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah)"},{"id":"7199","question_id":"7199","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Visiting graves is Sunnah in all places, \r\n    especially visiting al-Baqee&rsquo; where many of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) are buried, including Ameer al-Mu&rsquo;mineen &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him).

Then he \r\n    rode on until he came to the place of standing, and stood there. He said, &ldquo;I am standing here but all of &lsquo;Arafah is the place of standing.&rdquo; Then \r\n    he remained standing, facing the qiblah, raising his hands, remembering Allaah and calling upon Him, until the sun had set completely, then he \r\n    went on to Muzdalifah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some of the mistakes that some pilgrims make \r\n    in &lsquo;Arafah are as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;-1-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some pilgrims pass you and you do not hear \r\n    them reciting the Talbiyah. They do not recite the Talbiyah out loud on their way from Mina to &lsquo;Arafah. It was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) continued to recite the Talbiyah until he had stoned Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah on the day of Eid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-2-<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;One of the most serious mistakes that some \r\n    pilgrims make is to stop outside &lsquo;Arafah, and they stay there until the sun goes down, then they leave for Muzdalifah. Those who stand in these \r\n    places have not performed Hajj, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Hajj is &lsquo;Arafah.&rdquo; (Narrated by \r\n    al-Tirmidhi (889) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Irwa&rsquo; al-Ghaleel<\/i>, 1064). Whoever does not stand in &lsquo;Arafah in a place that is part \r\n    of it, and at the time specified for the standing, his Hajj is not valid, because of the hadeeth referred to. This is a serious matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are markers that clearly indicate the \r\n    boundaries of &lsquo;Arafah, and they are not hidden except for one who is careless and negligent. Every pilgrim must look for the boundaries so that he \r\n    will be sure that he is standing in &lsquo;Arafah and not outside it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I wish that those who organize the Hajj would \r\n    announce to the people via a means that would reach all of them, in numerous languages, and tell the mutawwifeen (Hajj guides) to warn the \r\n    pilgrims about that, so that the people would be aware of this issue and perform their Hajj in the proper manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-3-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people busy themselves with du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; at \r\n    the end of the day, so you see them facing towards the mountain by which the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    stood, even though the qiblah may be behind them or to their right or their left. This is also ignorance and a mistake. What is prescribed for \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; on the day of &lsquo;Arafah is for the person to face the qiblah, whether the mountain is in front of him or behind him, or to his right or his \r\n    left. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only faced this mountain because the place where he stood was behind the \r\n    mountain. He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) faced towards the qiblah, and because the mountain was between him and the qiblah, \r\n    he had not choice but to face it too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-4- &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people think that they have to go to the \r\n    place where the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, beside the mountain, and stand there. So you see them \r\n    putting themselves through a great deal of trouble to reach that place. They may be walking and may be unfamiliar with the routes and getting \r\n    hungry and thirsty if they cannot find food and water, and getting lost, and suffering a great deal of harm because of this mistaken notion. It \r\n    was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;I am standing here but all of &lsquo;Arafah is the place of \r\n    standing.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is as if the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was pointing out that no one should go to the trouble of standing in the place where the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, rather people should do what is easy for them, because all of &lsquo;Arafah is the place of standing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-5-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people think that the trees in &lsquo;Arafaah \r\n    are like the trees in Mina and Muzdalifah, i.e., it is not permissible to cut a leaf or branch from them, and so on, because they think that \r\n    cutting the trees has to do with ihraam, like hunting. This is a mistaken notion, because cutting trees has nothing to do with ihraam, rather it \r\n    has to do with the place. Whatever trees are within the boundaries of the Haram are sacrosanct, and should not be cut and no leaves or branches \r\n    may be cut from them. Whatever is outside the boundaries of the Haram may be cut, even if a person is in ihraam. Based on this there is nothing \r\n    wrong with cutting the trees in &lsquo;Arafaah&hellip; (With regard to trees that have been planted by people, they are not covered by the prohibition on \r\n    cutting the trees in the Haram, but it may be haraam to cut them for another reason, namely transgressing the rights of the people who planted \r\n    them, and transgressing the rights of the pilgrims too, if these trees were planted to reduce the heat and to shade people from the sun.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on this, it is not permissible to cut \r\n    the trees that are planted in &lsquo;Arafah, not because of the Haram, but because cutting them is a transgression of the rights of all the Muslims).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-6-<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Some pilgrims think that the mountain by \r\n    which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood is holy and special, so they go to it and climb up it, and seek blessings \r\n    from its stones and soil. They hang pieces of cloth from its trees, and do other things that are well known. These are innovations (bid&rsquo;ah). It is \r\n    not prescribed to climb the mountain or to pray there, or to hang pieces of cloth on its trees, because none of that was narrated from the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Indeed, such things smack of idolatry, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) passed by a tree of the mushrikeen on which they used to hang their weapons, and those who were with him said, &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, make for us a Dhaat Anwaat [the name of the tree] like their Dhaat Anwaat.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said, &ldquo;Allaahu akbar! These are traditions and you are following the traditions of those who came before you. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, \r\n    you have spoken as the Children of Israel spoke to Moosa: &lsquo;Make us a god as they have gods.&rsquo;&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2180; classed as hasan by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Sunnah li Ibn Abi &lsquo;Aasim<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This mountain is not holy, rather it is like any other hills in \r\n    &lsquo;Arafah, and the valley in it. But the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood there, so it is prescribed to \r\n    stand where the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, if possible, but it is not obligatory, so no one has \r\n    to make things difficult for himself by going there, for the reasons explained above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-7-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people think that it is essential to \r\n    pray Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr with the imam in the mosque, hence you see them going to that place from far away so that they can be with the imam in the \r\n    mosque. This causes them a great deal of difficulty and many of them lose their way, which makes Hajj too hard for them, and they crowd one \r\n    another and upset one another. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the standing, &ldquo;I am \r\n    standing here, but all of &lsquo;Arafah is the place of standing.&rdquo; And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: &ldquo;The earth has \r\n    been made a mosque (place of prayer) and a means of purification for me.&rdquo; So if a person prays in his tent in a calm and dignified manner, without \r\n    being disturbed or disturbing others, and without trouble that makes Hajj too hard, that is better.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-8-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some of them leave &lsquo;Arafah before the sun \r\n    sets, and go to Muzdalifah. This is a serious mistake, and is acting like the mushrikeen who used to leave &lsquo;Arafah before sunset. It is also going \r\n    against the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who did not leave &lsquo;Arafah until after the sun had set and the yellow \r\n    afterglow had diminished somewhat, as it says in the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on this, pilgrims have to stay in \r\n    &lsquo;Arafah, within its boundaries, until the sun sets, because this standing lasts until the sun sets; just as it is not permissible for a person who \r\n    is fasting to break his fast before sunset, so it is not permissible for the one who is standing in &lsquo;Arafah to leave before the sun sets.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-9-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Wasting time in matters that are of no \r\n    benefit. So you see people from the beginning of the day until the end engaged in conversations that may be innocent and free of gossip, or it may \r\n    not be such, because they are slandering people&rsquo;s honour and eating their flesh. If it is the latter then they are combining two haraam actions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Eating people&rsquo;s flesh and backbiting about them. This is a violation of the conditions of ihraam, \r\n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So whosoever intends to perform Hajj \r\n    therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:197]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Wasting time<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Even if the talk is innocent and does not \r\n    include anything haraam, it is still a waste of time, but there is nothing wrong with a person passing the time in innocent conversation before \r\n    the sun reaches its zenith. But after the sun has passed its zenith and the people have prayed Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, it is better to occupy oneself with \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, dhikr and reading Qur&rsquo;aan, and speaking beneficial words to one&rsquo;s brothers for a break from reading and dhikr. So he can say some useful \r\n    words to them about some Islamic knowledge etc., that will make them feel happy, and give them hope of the mercy of Allaah. But he should make the \r\n    most of the opportunity at the end of the day and occupy himself with du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, beseeching Allaah and seeking His bounty and mercy, and persist in making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and make of lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in the words narrated in the Qur&rsquo;aan and saheeh Sunnah, for these are the best of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s, and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s offered at this time are more likely to be answered. &nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: From Daleel al-Akhta&rsquo; allati yuqa&rsquo; fiha al-Haaj wa&rsquo;l-Mu&rsquo;tamir (Guide to mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah)."},{"id":"7201","question_id":"7201","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not narrated that the Sahaabah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with them) recited the Talbiyah in unison.

If you do not manage to stone the Jamaraat during the day, then you can do it at night, because night is \r\n    also the time for stoning, although the day is preferable. But it is better for a person to come and do the stoning at night in a calm, dignified \r\n    and humble manner than to come during the day fearing that he may die because of the overcrowding, and he may throw his pebbles and they may not \r\n    land in the pit. The point is if someone uses the overcrowding as an excuse, we say to him: Allaah has given plenty of room for manoeuvre, so you \r\n    can stone the Jamaraat at night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly if a woman is afraid of something \r\n    if she stones the Jamaraat with the people, she can delay it until the night. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    did not allow the weak ones among his family &ndash; such as Sawdah bint Zam&rsquo;ah and those like her &ndash; to forego stoning the Jamaraat and to delegate \r\n    someone else to do it on their behalf; rather he gave them permission to leave Muzdalifah at the end of the night, to stone the Jamaraat before \r\n    the place became crowded. This is the greatest evidence that a woman should not delegate this task just because she is a woman.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Yes, if a person is disabled and unable to \r\n    stone the Jamaraat by himself, either during the day or at night, then in this case it is permissible for him to delegate it to someone else, \r\n    because he is incapable of doing it. It was narrated from the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) that they sued to stone the Jamaraat on \r\n    behalf of their children, because the children were unable to do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whatever the case, being careless with regard \r\n    to this matter &ndash; i.e., delegating the stoning of the Jamaraat, except for those who have excuses which mean that they are unable to do it &ndash; is a \r\n    serious mistake, because it is carelessness with regard to an act of worship, and negligence with regard to a duty.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7210","question_id":"7210","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) and he said: &ldquo;The ruling on this, as is well known from the shar&rsquo;i ruling, is that everyone who worships \r\n    Allaah in a manner that has not been prescribed by Allaah is an innovator.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) defined the meeqaats and said: &ldquo;They are for them (their residents) and whoever comes to them who is not of their people.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1524; Muslim, \r\n    1181.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it was narrated in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> \r\n    that when the people of Iraq complained to &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), saying that the meeqaat that the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had defined for the people of Najd was out of their way, or was too far for them, he (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Look for a place that is in line with it on your route.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1531. This indicates that \r\n    coming in line with the meeqaat is like passing through it. So one who comes in line with the meeqaat from above, in a plane, is like one who \r\n    passes through it, so he has to enter ihraam when he comes in line with the meeqaat, and it is not permissible for him to pass the meeqaat and \r\n    enter ihraam when he lands in Jeddah.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;The way to correct this mistake is to do \r\n    ghusl in one&rsquo;s house or in the airport, and to change in the plane and put on the ihraam garments and take off one&rsquo;s regular clothes. Then when he \r\n    comes in line with the meeqaat he should enter ihraam from there, and recite the talbiyah for whatever he intends to do, &lsquo;Umrah or Hajj. It is not \r\n    permissible for him to delay that until he reaches Jeddah. If he does that then he has done wrong and according to the majority of scholars he has \r\n    to offer a sacrifice which he should slaughter in Makkah and distribute the meat to the poor, because he has omitted one of the obligatory \r\n    duties.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-2-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people think that it is essential to \r\n    enter ihraam wearing shoes, and that if a person is not wearing shoes when he enters ihraam, then it is not permissible for him to put them on. \r\n    This is a mistake because it is not essential to wear shoes when entering ihraam. Ihraam may be done without wearing shoes, and if a person enters \r\n    ihraam without wearing shoes, that does not mean that he cannot put them on afterwards. He can put shoes on afterwards if he wasn&rsquo;t wearing them \r\n    when he entered ihraam &ndash; there is nothing wrong with that.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;-3-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people think that it is essential to \r\n    enter ihraam in the ihraam garments and to keep them on until they exit ihraam, and that it is not permitted to change these clothes. This is a \r\n    mistake, because the muhrim (person in ihraam) is permitted to change his ihraam garments with or without a reason, if he changes them for \r\n    something that he is permitted to wear during ihraam.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;In this regard there is no difference \r\n    between men and women. Anyone who enters ihraam in ihraam garments and wants to change it may do so, but sometimes he may have to change it, such \r\n    as if it becomes contaminated with some impurity (najaasah) that he cannot wash without taking it off. And sometimes changing it may be \r\n    preferable, such as if it becomes very dirty, without there being any najaasah, so he should change it for a clean ihraam garment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Sometimes the matter may be one in which he \r\n    has the choice: if he wants he can change it and if he does not want he does not have to change it. The point is that this notion is incorrect, \r\n    namely the pilgrim&rsquo;s belief that if he enters ihraam in a certain garment it is not permissible for him to take if off until he has exited his \r\n    ihraam.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;-4-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people uncover their right shoulders and \r\n    throw the end of the rida&rsquo; (upper garment) over their left shoulders from the time they enter ihraam, i.e., from the moment they form the \r\n    intention, so we see many pilgrims &ndash; if not most of them &ndash; wearing their ihraam garments in this manner from the moment they enter ihraam until \r\n    they exit ihraam. This is a mistake, because this manner of wearing the ihraam is only to be done during Tawaaf al-Qudoom (the tawaaf performed \r\n    upon arrival in Makkah), not during al-saa&rsquo;ee and not before the tawaaf.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-5-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some of them believe that it is obligatory to \r\n    pray two rak&rsquo;ahs when entering ihraam.

Rather the correct \r\n    view on this matter was that suggested by Abu&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Abbaas Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said that there is no \r\n    specific prayer to be offered when entering ihraam, because that was not narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him).<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;If a person does ghusl and puts on the \r\n    ihraam garments, then he should enter ihraam without praying, unless it is the time of prayer, such as if the time for an obligatory prayer has \r\n    come or is approaching, and he wants to stay at the meeqaat until he has prayed. In that case it is better for him to enter ihraam after praying. \r\n    With regard to intending to pray a specific prayer in ihraam, the most correct opinion is that there is no specific prayer for entering ihraam.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: From Dalaa&rsquo;il al-Akhta&rsquo; allati yaqa&rsquo; fiha al-Haaj wa&rsquo;l-Mu&rsquo;tamir (mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah)"},{"id":"7214","question_id":"7214","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;With regard to what some people do, doing a \r\n    lot of &lsquo;Umrahs after Hajj from al-Tan&rsquo;eem of from al-Ji&rsquo;raanah etc., we have stated above that there is no evidence that it is prescribed to do \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah after Hajj, rather the evidence indicates that it is better not to do that, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) and his companions did not do &lsquo;Umrah after they had finished Hajj.

(What is meant by it becoming very light is when the daylight has spread before the sun actually rises). The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) granted a concession to the weak among his family, allowing them to leave Muzdalifah at night. Asma&rsquo; bint Abi \r\n    Bakr used to watch for the setting of the moon, and when the moon disappeared she left Muzdalifah and went to Mina.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This &ndash; leaving after the moon has set &ndash; \r\n    should be the criterion, because it was the action of one of the Sahaaabah, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave \r\n    permission to the weak among his family to leave at night; in this hadeeth he did not give a definition of night, but the actions of the Sahaabi \r\n    explain that. So the factor that should determine when the weak and others for whom the crowding is difficult should leave Muzdalifah is when the \r\n    moon sets on the night of the tenth of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, which is definitely after midnight, when approximately two-thirds of the night have passed. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-7-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people stay up on the night of \r\n    Muzdalifah praying qiyaam, reading Qur&rsquo;aan and reciting dhikr.

If you left before performing the farewell tawaaf, then you have to \r\n    offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in the Haram; and you should not eat any \r\n    of it, rather it should be given to the poor, because the farewell tawaaf is \r\n    obligatory after Hajj, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah have mercy on him): &ldquo;The people were commanded that the \r\n    last thing they do should do is to circumambulate the House, but an \r\n    exception was made for menstruating women.&rdquo; (Saheeh &ndash; agreed upon).

The evidence for that is the fact \r\n    that Asma&rsquo; bint &lsquo;Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) gave birth, when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) was camped at Dhu&rsquo;l-Hulayfah (which is the meeqaat for the people \r\n    of Madeenah), on his way to do Hajj.

The blood of menstruation is like the blood of nifaas, so when \r\n    the menstruating woman reaches the meeqaat, she should do ghusl and tie a \r\n    piece of cloth around herself, and enter ihraam, in accordance with this \r\n    hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and al-Marwah done by a \r\n    menstruating woman is valid, but her tawaaf is not valid.

But she has to do this tawaaf and she has not gone through \r\n    the second stage of exiting ihraam until she does it, as stated above.

The one who enters ihraam when she is menstruating may do all \r\n    the actions of Hajj, but she should not circumambulate the House until her \r\n    period ends and she does ghusl. The same applies to a woman who is bleeding \r\n    following childbirth (nifaas).

As \r\n    for her tawaaf when she was menstruating, it is not valid, but her saa&rsquo;i is \r\n    valid, because the correct view is that it is permissible to do saa&rsquo;i before \r\n    tawaaf during Hajj. Based on this, she has to repeat the tawaaf, because \r\n    tawaaf al-ifaadah is one of the essential parts of Hajj, and the second \r\n    stage of exiting ihraam cannot be completed without it.

They may be explained as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people think that it is essential for the pilgrim doing \r\n    Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah to enter through a specific gate of al-Masjid al-Haraam. So \r\n    some people think that if they are doing &lsquo;Umrah they must enter through the \r\n    gate called Baab al-&lsquo;Umrah, and that this is essential and is prescribed in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. Others think that they must enter through Baab al-Salaam, and \r\n    that entering through any other gate is a sin or is makrooh. There is no \r\n    basis for this. The pilgrim doing Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah may enter through any gate, \r\n    but when he enters the mosque he should enter with his right foot first and \r\n    say what is narrated for entering all mosques, and send blessings upon the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and say, &ldquo;<i>Allaahumma \r\n    aghfir li dhunoobi waftah li abwaab rahmatika<\/i> (O Allaah forgive me and \r\n    open to me the doors of Your Mercy).&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 713.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people have invented specific du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s for when one \r\n    enters the Mosque and sees the Ka&rsquo;bah, and have introduced du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s that were \r\n    not narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him). This is a kind of bid&rsquo;ah (innovation). Worshipping Allaah with words, \r\n    actions or beliefs that were not known to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions is innovation and \r\n    misguidance which the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) warned us against.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people - even those who are not doing Hajj &ndash; mistakenly \r\n    believe that the greeting for al-Masjid al-Haraam is tawaaf, in the sense \r\n    that it is Sunnah for everyone who enters al-Masjid al-Haraam to do tawaaf, \r\n    basing that on the view of some of the fuqaha&rsquo; that the Sunnah when entering \r\n    al-Masjid al-Haraam is to do tawaaf. In fact this is not the case. Al-Masjid \r\n    al-Haraam is like all other mosques, concerning which the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When any one \r\n    of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down until he has prayed two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 444; Muslim, 714.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you enter al-Masjid al-Haraam to do tawaaf other than \r\n    the tawaaf of Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah, or for a voluntary tawaaf, then it is \r\n    permissible for you to do tawaaf without praying two rak&rsquo;ahs first. This is \r\n    what is meant by saying that the greeting for al-Masjid al-Haraam is tawaaf. \r\n    Based on this, if you enter with no intention to do tawaaf, rather you are \r\n    waiting for the prayer or you are coming to attend a lesson etc, then \r\n    al-Masjid al-Haraam is like any other mosque and it is Sunnah to pray two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs before you sit down, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7230","question_id":"7230","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said: This is a very serious mistake, when some people enter through the \r\n    gate of the Hijr when doing tawaaf and exit through the other gate when it \r\n    is crowded, thinking that this is easier. It is a serious mistake because \r\n    the one who does that is not considered to be doing tawaaf around the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and circumambulate the Ancient House (the Ka&lsquo;bah at \r\n    Makkah)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hajj 22:29]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    circumambulated the House from outside the Hijr.

This is a serious \r\n    matter, especially since tawaaf is a pillar (essential part) of both Hajj \r\n    and &lsquo;Umrah. The answer to that is that we should explain to the pilgrims \r\n    that tawaaf is not valid unless it encompasses the entire Ka&rsquo;bah, including \r\n    the Hijr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h2>\r\n    Calling the Hijr &ldquo;Hijr Ismaa&rsquo;eel&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I would like to take this opportunity to point out that many \r\n    people call the Hijr &ldquo;Hijr Ismaa&rsquo;eel&rdquo;, but in fact Ismaa&rsquo;eel had nothing to \r\n    do with it and it is not his Hijr. Rather this Hijr came into being when \r\n    Quraysh ran short of cash, when they wanted to rebuild the Ka&rsquo;bah, and they \r\n    did not have enough resources to build the Ka&rsquo;bah on the foundations of \r\n    Ibraaheem, so they left this side out of it, and it was called <i>hateem<\/i> \r\n    and <i>hijr<\/i>; so Ismaa&rsquo;eel knew nothing of it and had nothing to do with \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are some people who do not make sure they keep the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah on their left, so you see them doing tawaaf with their women folk, \r\n    and they hold hands with their brothers or friends to protect the women, so \r\n    you see them doing tawaaf with their back towards the Ka&rsquo;bah, and his \r\n    brother or friend doing tawaaf facing towards the Ka&rsquo;bah. This is also a \r\n    serious mistake, because the scholars say: One of the conditions of tawaaf \r\n    being valid is that the Ka&rsquo;bah should be to one's left, and if you have you \r\n    back towards it, or face it, or walk with it to your right, then this tawaaf \r\n    is not valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What people should do is to pay attention to this matter, and \r\n    strive to make sure the Ka&rsquo;bah is to their left throughout tawaaf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are some people who put their backs to the Ka'bah or \r\n    face it for a few steps because of the crowding. This is also a mistake. \r\n    People should be on the safe side with regard to religious matters, and \r\n    acknowledge the boundaries set by Allaah with regard to worship and avoid \r\n    mistakes, so that they will worship Allaah with knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Does it not astonish you \r\n    that if a man wants to travel to a land that he does not know, he does not \r\n    travel until he has asked about it and tried to find out the easiest way to \r\n    get there, so that he can reach it comfortably and with ease, without \r\n    getting lost, but when it comes to matters of religion, many people &ndash; \r\n    unfortunately &ndash; start their worship and do not know the limits set by \r\n    Allaah.

So uttering \r\n    the intention out loud when doing tawaaf is a mistake and an innovation. \r\n    Just as it is a mistake from the point of view of sharee&rsquo;ah, it is also a \r\n    mistake from a rational point of view. What is the point of uttering the \r\n    intention out loud when the intention is a matter between you and your Lord, \r\n    and Allaah knows what is in people&rsquo;s hearts and He knows that you are going \r\n    to circumambulate this House.

The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did tawaaf before \r\n    you and did not speak the intention out loud when they did tawaaf, or when \r\n    doing any other act of worship, so this is a mistake.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of those who do tawaaf push and shove too much when they \r\n    touch the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner, and they are disturbed by the \r\n    overcrowding and disturb others. They may be pushing and shoving a woman, \r\n    and the Shaytaan may tempt him and fill his heart with desire when he is \r\n    crowding this woman in this narrow place. People are only human and may be \r\n    overwhelmed by their souls that prompt them to do evil, so an evil action \r\n    may take place in the shadow of the House of Allaah. This is a matter that \r\n    becomes even worse in light of where it takes place, although it is a fitnah \r\n    in any place it happens.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not prescribed to push and shove when touching the \r\n    Black Stone or the Yemeni Corner, rather if it is easy for you to do so in a \r\n    calm and dignified manner, then you must do it, and if it is not easy for \r\n    you to do it, then you should just point to the Black Stone.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the Yemeni Corner, there is no report from the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he pointed to \r\n    it, and we cannot compare it to the Black Stone, because the Black Stone is \r\n    greater than it, and it was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) pointed to the Black Stone. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Just as crowding is not prescribed in this situation and \r\n    there is the fear that it may cause fitnah when one is crowded together with \r\n    women, so too it may also cause annoyance, because in crowded situations a \r\n    person will inevitably hear words that he dislikes and he will feel annoyed \r\n    and angry when he leaves this place. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the person who is doing tawaaf should do is always \r\n    remain calm and dignified, so that he will have the proper presence of mind \r\n    for worshipping Allaah.

This is a \r\n    mistaken notion. Kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah, and it is not an \r\n    independent Sunnah either, rather it is Sunnah for the one who is doing \r\n    tawaaf. I do not know that kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah except in \r\n    tawaaf. Based on this, since kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah and is not \r\n    obligatory and is not a condition of Tawaaf, then if a person does not kiss \r\n    it, we do not say that his tawaaf is invalid or that his tawaaf is lacking \r\n    and he is sinning. Rather his tawaaf is valid and if there is a lot of \r\n    crowding then pointing is better than touching, because this is what the \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did when the \r\n    place was crowded, and because by doing this a person avoids harm that he \r\n    may do to others or that others may do to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If someone were to ask us: If the Mataaf (place of tawaaf) is \r\n    very crowded, what do you think &ndash; is it better to push in and touch and kiss \r\n    the Black Stone, or to point to it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We say that it is better to point to it, because that is the \r\n    Sunnah.

Based on this, it is \r\n    not prescribed to kiss the Yemeni Corner, because that was not proven from \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \r\n    Rather that was narrated in a da&rsquo;eef (weak) hadeeth that cannot be taken as \r\n    evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -5-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people, when they touch the Black Stone or Yemeni \r\n    Corner, touch it with their left hands in a careless manner. This is a \r\n    mistake, because the right hand is better than the left hand, and the left \r\n    hand is only used for unclean things such as cleaning oneself after \r\n    relieving oneself, or rinsing one's nose, and so on.

This is undoubtedly contrary \r\n    to the purpose, for the purpose of touching the Black Stone or wiping it or \r\n    kissing it is to glorify Allaah.

Hence when the caliph \r\n    &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) touched the Black Stone he said: &ldquo;By \r\n    Allaah, I know that you are just a stone and can neither cause harm nor \r\n    bring benefit.

But if the one who does that is ignorant and does not \r\n    realize that this is bid&rsquo;ah, then there is the hope that he may be forgiven. \r\n    But if he knows that this is bid&rsquo;ah or is negligent and does not ask about \r\n    his religion, then he is sinning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -7-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people recite a specific du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in each circuit. This is \r\n    a kind of bid&rsquo;ah that was not narrated from the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions. The Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not recite a specific \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in each circuit, and neither did his companions. The most that can be \r\n    said concerning that is that between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say:\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good \r\n    and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the \r\n    Fire!&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:201 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Tawaaf around the House and (Saa&rsquo;i) between al-Safa and al-Marwah and the \r\n    stoning of the Jamaar have only been prescribed so that remembrance of \r\n    Allaah (dhikr) will be established.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This bid&rsquo;ah is even more wrong when the person carries a \r\n    small booklet in which there is a du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for each circuit, and he reads this \r\n    booklet, not knowing what he is saying, either because he does not know \r\n    Arabic and does not understand the meanings, or because although he is an \r\n    Arab and speaks Arabic he does not know what he is saying. We even hear some \r\n    of them say du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s that clearly deviate from Islamic teaching; for example, \r\n    we have heard someone saying, &ldquo;O Allaah, make me independent of means by \r\n    Your Majesty (<i>jalaalika<\/i>) so I have no need of that which You have \r\n    forbidden&rdquo; when he should have said, &ldquo;by that which You have permitted (<i>halaalika<\/i>).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We also see some people reading this booklet, and when they \r\n    finish the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for the circuit they are doing, they stop and do not \r\n    recite any other du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s for the rest of that circuit. If there are not many \r\n    people in the Mataaf, they finish the circuit before they finish the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, \r\n    so they cut the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; short.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The remedy for that is to explain to the pilgrims that during \r\n    tawaaf a person can say whatever du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; he wants, and he can remember Allaah \r\n    (dhikr) however he wants. If this is explained to the people this problem \r\n    will go away.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h2>\r\n    Ruling on one who falls into these innovations&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to these actions, people are either:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>completely ignorant and do not \r\n    realize that what they are doing is haraam.

Crowds of pilgrims pass by and you \r\n    can hardly hear anyone reciting the Talbiyah. This is contrary to the Sunnah \r\n    and it is contrary to what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) enjoined his Companions to do. The Sunnah is for a person \r\n    to recite the Talbiyah out loud and to raise his voice if it is not \r\n    difficult for him to do so. He should remember that nothing hears him, rock \r\n    or soil, but it will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection before \r\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some pilgrims go directly to &lsquo;Arafah and do not stay \r\n    overnight in Mina. Although this is permissible, because staying overnight \r\n    in Mina before the day of &lsquo;Arafat is not obligatory, it is better for a \r\n    person to follow the Sunnah, as it is narrated that the Messenger of Allah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stopped in Mina from the forenoon \r\n    on the eighth (of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah) until the sun rose on the ninth. The \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that and \r\n    he said: &ldquo;Learn from me your rituals (of Hajj). Narrated by Muslim (1218).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he comes to &lsquo;Arafah and did not stay overnight in Mina \r\n    on the night before the ninth, there is nothing wrong with that, because of \r\n    the hadeeth of &lsquo;Urwah ibn al-Mudarras, who came to the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) at the time of Fajr prayer on the day of Eid \r\n    in Muzdalifah and said: O Messenger of Allah, I have exhausted my mount and \r\n    tired myself. By Allaah, I have not left a single mountain but I have stood \r\n    on it. Is my Hajj valid? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever prays this prayer with us and stands with us until we move \r\n    on, and stood before that in &lsquo;Arafah by night or by day has completed his \r\n    Hajj and fulfilled his duties.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood (1950).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) did not mention staying overnight in Mina on the night before the \r\n    ninth. This indicates that it is not obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another mistake that people make with regard to staying in Mina on the eighth is that some people shorten their prayers and join them in Mina, so they join Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, and Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;. This is contrary to the Sunnah. What is prescribed for the people in Mina is to shorten their prayers without joining them. This is the Sunnah that is narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Although joining prayers is permissible, because one is travelling and it is permissible for the traveller to join prayers whether he has halted or is on the move, it is preferable for the traveller who has halted not to join prayers unless that is for a reason, and there is no reason that would dictate joining prayers in Mina. Hence the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not join his prayers in Mina but he did shorten the four-rak&rsquo;ah prayers to two rak&rsquo;ahs, so he prayed Zuhr with two rak&rsquo;ahs at its proper time, &lsquo;Asr with two rak&rsquo;ahs at its proper time, Maghrib with three rak&rsquo;ahs at its proper time, &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; with two rak&rsquo;ahs at its proper time and Fajr at its proper time.

I have seen that with my own eyes. I saw a man doing saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and he had shaved half \r\n    of his head completely and left the rest of his hair. I grabbed him and said to him, &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I did it because I want to \r\n    do &lsquo;Umrah twice, so I shaved half for the first &lsquo;Umrah and left half for this &lsquo;Umrah.&rdquo; This is ignorance and misguidance that none of the scholars \r\n    ever suggested.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-2-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some people, when they want to exit ihraam of \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah, cut a few hairs on their head, on one side only. This is contrary to the apparent meaning of the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;(some) having your heads shaved, and \r\n    (some) having your head hair cut short&hellip;&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Fath 48:27]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The shortening of the hair should have an \r\n    obvious effect on the head. It is known that cutting one or two or three hairs does not have any effect and it is not apparent that the pilgrim \r\n    who has done &lsquo;Umrah has in fact shortened his hair. So he is going against the apparent meaning of the verse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The remedy for these two mistakes is for the \r\n    one who wants to shave his head to shave all of it, and to shorten the hair all over the head if he wants to cut it, and not to cut just one or \r\n    two hairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>-3-&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are some people who, when they have \r\n    finished saa&rsquo;i, if they cannot find anyone to shave their heads or cut their hair, they go back to their houses and exit ihraam, and put on \r\n    regular clothes, then they shave their heads or cut their hair after that. This is a serious mistake, because a person cannot exit ihraam without \r\n    shaving his head or cutting his hair, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when during the Farewell Pilgrimage he \r\n    commanded those of his companions who had not brought a hadiy (sacrificial animal) to make it &lsquo;Umrah, and he said, &ldquo;Let him cut his hair then exit \r\n    ihraam.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1691; Muslim, 1229.&nbsp; This indicates that one cannot exit ihraam until after cutting the hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on this, if a pilgrim finishes saa&rsquo;i and cannot find someone to cut his hair, he should remain in ihraam until he shaves his head or cuts his hair; it is not permissible for him to exit ihraam before that. If we assume that a person did that out of ignorance and exited ihraam before shaving or cutting his hair, thinking that it was permissible to do so, there is no blame on him because of his ignorance, but when he finds out about that he should take off his regular clothes and put on his ihraam garments, because it is not permissible to continue exiting ihraam when he knows that it is not permissible. Then when he has shaved his head or cut his hair, he may exit ihraam.&rdquo;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: &nbsp;From Daleel al-Akhta&rsquo; allati yaqa&rsquo; fiha al-Haaj wa&rsquo;l-Mu&rsquo;tamir (Mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah)"},{"id":"7245","question_id":"7245","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      It is not proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n      Allah be upon him) encouraged climbing the mountain of &lsquo;Arafaat which is \r\n      known to the people as Jabal al-Rahmah. It was not his way to climb this \r\n      mountain during Hajj or to take it as a ritual. He (blessings and peace of \r\n      Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Learn from me your rituals (of Hajj).&rdquo; The way \r\n      of the Rightly Guided Caliphs and all the Sahaabah was like that of the \r\n      Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the same was true \r\n      of those who followed in their footsteps.

What is proven is that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n      him) stood at the foot of this mountain at the large rocks and he said: &ldquo;I \r\n      have stood here and all of &lsquo;Arafah is the place of standing, and avoid the \r\n      valley of &lsquo;Aranah. Hence many of the scholars, such as Imam al-Nawawi, \r\n      Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh Siddeeq Khan, said: Climbing this \r\n      mountain during Hajj as if it were a ritual is an innovation. The Prophet \r\n      (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action \r\n      that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo; It was not \r\n      his practice to offer any naafil prayer in the standing at &lsquo;Arafah; rather \r\n      he limited it to praying Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr in Masjid Namirah, joining and \r\n      shortening the prayer. He did not take any place for prayer in what is \r\n      called Jabal al-Rahmah in which those who climb this mountain should offer \r\n      naafil or obligatory prayers on the day of &lsquo;Arafah. Rather, after praying \r\n      Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, he busied himself with remembering Allah (dhikr), reciting \r\n      tasbeeh (&ldquo;Subhaan Allah&rdquo;), tahleel (Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah), tahmeed \r\n      (al-hamdu Lillah), takbeer (Allahu akbar) and Talbiyah, calling upon his \r\n      Lord and beseeching Him, until the sun set.

Otherwise she should gather her hair and cut something from the \r\n    ends of all of it.

It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n    that he said: The length of a fingertip. Ibn Habeeb narrated from Maalik \r\n    that it should be the length of a fingertip or a little more or a little \r\n    less. Maalik said: In our view there is no specific amount, and whatever she \r\n    cuts off is acceptable, but it is essential to cut something from all of the \r\n    hair, whether it is long or short. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i> (3\/196): It is obligatory to cut or shave all of the hair; \r\n    this (with regard to cutting the hair) also applies to women.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said (3\/226): A woman should cut a fingertip&rsquo;s length \r\n    from her hair. What is meant by the fingertip is the end of the finger, from \r\n    the highest knuckle. What is prescribed for women is to cut the hair, not to \r\n    shave the head, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that. Ibn \r\n    al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed on this. It was \r\n    narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Women \r\n    do not have to shave their heads; rather women have to cut their hair.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood. It was narrated that &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    told women not to shave their heads. Narrated by at-Tirmidhi. Ahmad used to \r\n    say: She should cut a fingertip&rsquo;s length from each lock of hair. This is the \r\n    view of Ibn &lsquo;Umar, ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i, Ishaaq and Abu Thawr. Abu Dawood said: I \r\n    heard Ahmad being asked whether a woman should cut something from all of her \r\n    hair. He said: Yes; she should gather her hair at the front of her head then \r\n    remove a fingertip&rsquo;s length from the ends of her hair. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>ash-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i> (7\/329): &ldquo;A woman should cut a fingertip&rsquo;s length \r\n    from her hair&rdquo; refers to the top of the finger. In other words, a woman \r\n    should take hold of her braids, if she has braids, or the ends of her hair, \r\n    if she does not have braids, and trim the length of a fingertip from it. \r\n    That is approximately two centimeters. With regard to what is common among \r\n    women, which is wrapping the end of the hair around the finger then cutting \r\n    it , that is not correct. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, a woman who cut only one lock of her hair has \r\n    not cut it in the manner required. What she must do now is cut her hair in \r\n    the manner we have described, but there is no penalty on her for what she \r\n    may have done previously of things that are forbidden in ihram.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said \r\n    concerning a woman who had not completed her &lsquo;Umrah: With regard to what she \r\n    may have done of things that are forbidden in ihram, if we assume that her \r\n    husband had intercourse with her &ndash; and intercourse when in ihram is the most \r\n    serious of the things that are forbidden &ndash; there is no penalty on her, \r\n    because she was unaware (of the rulings), and anyone who does any action \r\n    that is forbidden when in ihram out of ignorance or forgetfulness, or \r\n    because he was compelled to do it, does not have to pay any penalty.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> \r\n    (21\/351).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: A man cut \r\n    his hair on one side after &lsquo;Umrah, then he went back to his family and he \r\n    found out that what he had done was not correct.

He \r\n    replied: If he did this thing out of ignorance, than what he must do is take \r\n    off his ordinary clothes now (and put on his ihram garments), and shave his \r\n    head completely or cut his hair. What he did is pardoned, because he did not \r\n    know. Shaving or cutting the hair does not have to be done in Makkah; rather \r\n    it may be done there or elsewhere. But if what he did was based on a fatwa \r\n    from one of the scholars, he does not have to do anything, because Allah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;<span>Ask \r\n    the people of knowledge, if you do not know<\/span>&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:7].

But the \r\n    reason behind the laws may or may not be apparent to everyone. The believer \r\n    is enjoined to submit and accept the laws of Allaah because that is a \r\n    requirement of his faith in Allaah as his Lord and God. So when discussing \r\n    with a kaafir, the aim should first of all be to explain to him the meaning \r\n    of this faith and the importance of submitting to the will of Allaah, then \r\n    after that one may speak about the reasons behind the laws.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to this \r\n    particular question we say:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah, may He be \r\n    glorified, has created mankind and made them of two genders, male and \r\n    female, and He has given each of them its own characteristics which are \r\n    suited to the role that each of them has to play in this life. Men have \r\n    roles and tasks that women cannot do, and women have roles and tasks that \r\n    men cannot do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If that is the case, then \r\n    it is perfectly wise to prepare each gender in a way that helps them to play \r\n    the role that is required of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is well known that gold \r\n    is something with which people adorn and beautify themselves, but a man is \r\n    not meant to do this, i.e., he is not a person who may be perfected by means \r\n    of adding something, rather a man is perfect in and of himself, because of \r\n    his manhood, so he has no need to adorn himself for some one else that he \r\n    may like, unlike women. A woman needs to adorn herself so as to make herself \r\n    attractive to her husband, thus creating a bond between her and her husband. \r\n    Hence it permissible for a woman to adorn herself with gold and other \r\n    things, so that the man will be attracted to her and seek her, and the \r\n    purpose of marriage will be achieved, which is the propagation of the human \r\n    species. Being brought up with adornments and softness is only appropriate \r\n    for women; as for men, it is something blameworthy in their case. Hence \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;(Like they then for \r\n    Allaah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing silk and gold \r\n    ornaments, i.e. women), and who in dispute cannot make herself clear?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Zukhruf 43:18]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is summary of what the \r\n    scholars have said in response to this question, as was mentioned by Shaykh \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> \r\n    (11\/60).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Because gold and adorning \r\n    oneself with it are things that are suited to the nature of women and the \r\n    role for which they have been created, it is obviously wise for it to be \r\n    forbidden for men to imitate women in that. The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>I&rsquo;laam<\/i> <i>al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een<\/i> \r\n    (2\/109):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Similarly the prohibition \r\n    on gold and silk for men is decreed so as to block the means that may lead \r\n    to men imitating women.

This applies only to the one who is doing \r\n    Hajj. As for the one who is doing &lsquo;umrah, he has to go out to the closest \r\n    point that is outside the Haram.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did \r\n    &lsquo;umrah from al-Ji&rsquo;raanah and he did not do &lsquo;umrah from al-Tan&rsquo;eem, rather he \r\n    told &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr to go with his sister &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah to enter \r\n    ihraam for &lsquo;umrah from al-Tan&rsquo;eem, because it was the closest place outside \r\n    the Haram. If it were permissible to enter ihraam for &lsquo;umrah from inside the \r\n    boundaries of the Haram, he would have given &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah permission to enter \r\n    ihraam from where she was in al-Abtah, and he would not have told her and \r\n    her brother to go to al-Tan&rsquo;eem to enter ihraam for &lsquo;umrah from there, \r\n    because that would cause unnecessary hardship when they were traveling. When \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was given the \r\n    choice between two things, he would always chose the one that was easier so \r\n    long as it was not a sin. Comparing Kada to al-Tan&rsquo;eem and al-Ji&rsquo;raanah is \r\n    not correct, because entering ihraam from the meeqaats is part of the \r\n    rituals. But their &lsquo;umrahs are still valid. So each of them has to offer a \r\n    sacrifice for entering ihraam for &lsquo;umrah from inside the Haram.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in <i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i> \r\n    (p. 515):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever wants to do Hajj or &lsquo;umrah has to enter ihraam from \r\n    the meeqaat when he passes it, and he should not go any further without \r\n    doing so. If he does that and passes the meeqaat, then he has to go back and \r\n    enter ihraam from there. If he goes back and enters ihraam then there is no \r\n    penalty, but if he enters ihraam from where he is and does not go back, then \r\n    according to the scholars he has to offer a sacrifice and distribute its \r\n    meat to the poor of Makkah.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7272","question_id":"7272","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The meeqaat for the people of Ethiopia and Somalia: if they \r\n    come from the south, when they are parallel with Yalamlam, which the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) decreed as the meeqaat for \r\n    the people of Yemen, they should enter ihraam when they are parallel with \r\n    it.

So if he does not do that and \r\n    they enter ihram from where they are, i.e., one hundred kilometres after \r\n    passing the miqaat, then each one of them has to offer a fidyah (ransom), a \r\n    sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed to the poor, \r\n    because they omitted one of the obligatory actions of the rituals, whether \r\n    for Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In this case, if they took the matter to court, perhaps the \r\n    court would rule that he is liable for the cost of this fidyah, because he \r\n    is the one who caused them to have to pay that penalty. This matter should \r\n    be referred to the court; if the judge thinks that it is appropriate, he may \r\n    say to the driver: You have to pay the value of the fidyahs that these \r\n    people slaughtered, because you are the one who transgressed against them; \r\n    you were the one who forgot and you were careless first of all, that you \r\n    transgressed against them a second time by depriving them of the right to go \r\n    back (to the miqaat).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh<\/i>, \r\n    21\/368&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7289","question_id":"7289","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      If your family are in Jeddah and you are living in Makkah \r\n      only for the purpose of study and you do not have a family there, then if \r\n      you are in Jeddah and want to go to Makkah for Hajj, not for study, you \r\n      have to enter ihraam from Jeddah.

The reason for this is because it is the time of Hajj, and \r\n    if a person passes by the miqaat at the time of Hajj and with the intention \r\n    of performing Hajj, then he has to enter ihram from that point, and this is \r\n    in compliance with the hadeeth &ldquo;And these miqaats are for the people at \r\n    those very places, and besides them for those who come through those places \r\n    with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umrah&rdquo;.

So she has to avoid all the \r\n    things that are prohibited during ihram, the most important of which is \r\n    intercourse with her husband, because she is still in a state of ihram until \r\n    she goes back to Makkah, does tawaaf and saa&lsquo;i, and cuts her hair, then \r\n    exits her ihram.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If she did any of the actions that are prohibited during \r\n    ihram before that, she is excused for them because she thought that her \r\n    &lsquo;umrah had ended.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    With regard to what she has done of the things that are prohibited (during \r\n    ihram), let us assume that her husband had intercourse with her, and \r\n    intercourse during ihram is the most serious of the prohibited actions; \r\n    however there is no blame on her because she was unaware of the ruling.

The Hanbalis do not regard it as \r\n    permissible to take the leaves, unlike the majority of scholars who say that \r\n    it is permissible to take them, because it does not harm the tree. This is \r\n    the view of the three other madhhabs.

And if it is haraam \r\n    to take something, every part of it is haraam, like the feathers of a bird.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Their saying that it does \r\n    not harm the tree is not correct because it weakens it, and it may lead to \r\n    its destruction.

If there was no public need for taking them, then if \r\n    she took them although she could have used some other leaves instead from \r\n    outside the Haram, then she should pray for forgiveness and repent to \r\n    Allaah.

The Prophet SAWS (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed it, and his ummah followed him \r\n    in doing so. If a person is unable to kiss it he should touch it with his \r\n    hand or with something, and then kiss that thing. If he is unable to do that \r\n    he should point to it with his hand and say Allaahu akbar.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Have We not established for them a secure \r\n    sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Qasas 28:57]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Have they not seen that We have made \r\n    (Makkah) a secure sanctuary, while men are being snatched away from all around them?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-&lsquo;Ankaboot 29:67]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;whosoever enters it, he attains security&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:97]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Muslim (1362) narrated that Jaabir said: The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Ibraaheem made Makkah a sanctuary, and I have made Madeenah a sanctuary&hellip; its \r\n    branches are not to be cut and its animals are not to be hunted.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The word that is translated as &ldquo;branches&rdquo; \r\n    here refers to every kind of tree that has thorns. If it is haraam to cut down the trees that have thorns then it is more appropriate that those \r\n    that do not have thorns should not be cut down.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Muslim (1374) narrated that Abu Sa&rsquo;eed \r\n    al-Khudri said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O Allaah, Ibraaheem made Makkah sacred and made it a \r\n    sanctuary, and I have made Madeenah a sanctuary&hellip; no blood is to be shed therein, no weapon for fighting is to be carried, and no tree is to be \r\n    struck to make its leaves fall, except to provide food for animals&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This shows that it is permissible to take the \r\n    leaves of plants to provide food for animals. What is meant here is that taking the leaves is haraam except for this purpose.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Quds (Jerusalem) is not a sanctuary in \r\n    this sense, according to the consensus of the Muslims. People use this word (Haram or sanctuary) in a very broad sense, to such an extent that \r\n    they call al-Quds a sanctuary, and the Mosque of Ibraaheem al-Khaleel in Palestine a sanctuary, and even universities are called sanctuaries. \r\n    There are no sanctuaries on earth apart from those in Makkah and Madeenah, and a valley in al-Taa&rsquo;if called Wujj concerning which the scholars \r\n    differed as to whether it was a sanctuary or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>\r\n    Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 27\/14-15:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Bayt al-Maqdis is not a place that can be \r\n    called a sanctuary (haram), nor is the Tomb of al-Khaleel or any other place on earth, except for three:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The first is a sanctuary according to the \r\n    consensus of the Muslims. This is the sanctuary of Makkah, which Allaah has honoured.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The second is a sanctuary according to the \r\n    majority of scholars. This is the sanctuary of the Prophet (i.e., in Madeenah). This is a sanctuary according to the majority of scholars such as \r\n    Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad. There are many saheeh hadeeth concerning this narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The third is Wujj, which is a valley in \r\n    al-Taa&rsquo;if. There is a hadeeth concerning this that was narrated by Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad<\/i>, not in the books of <i>Saheeh<\/i>. This is a \r\n    sanctuary according to al-Shaafa&rsquo;i because he believed the hadeeth to be saheeh, but it is not a sanctuary according to the majority of scholars. \r\n    Ahmad classed as da&rsquo;eef (weak) the hadeeth that was narrated concerning this and did not accept it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Places other than these are not sanctuaries \r\n    according to any of the Muslim scholars. The sanctuary is that in which Allaah has forbidden hunting and cutting its plants, and Allaah has not \r\n    forbidden hunting and cutting plants in any places except these three.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<\/font<\/div>\n\t\t<div>Islam Q&A<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"},{"id":"7297","question_id":"7297","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>O you who come to the City of the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), you have come to a good place and you are going to earn great reward. May Allaah \r\n    accept your righteous deeds and fulfil your greatest hopes. Welcome to the land of Hijrah and victory, the land of the Chosen Prophet, the land to \r\n    which the righteous Sahaabah migrated and the home of the Ansaar.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There follow a few words of advice to those \r\n    who want to visit the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; O you who come to Madeenah, you are in a place which, after Makkah, is the best and \r\n    noblest of all places, so respect it as it should be respected; honour its sanctity and holiness and observe the best etiquette therein. Know that \r\n    Allaah has warned of the severest punishment for those who commit evil therein. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Madeenah is a Haram (sanctuary), so whoever commits evil therein or gives \r\n    protection to an evildoer, the curse of Allaah, the angels and all of mankind may be upon him. Allaah will not accept any obligatory or naafil \r\n    deed from him on the Day of Resurrection.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1867; Muslim, 1370.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So whoever commits any evil action or offers \r\n    protection to any evildoer who seeks his help is exposing himself to a humiliating punishment and the wrath of the Lord of the Worlds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>One of the most serious of evil deeds that \r\n    violate its purity is openly doing acts of bid&rsquo;ah and spoiling its atmosphere with myths and false ideas, and contaminating its pure land with the \r\n    spread of articles which promote bid&rsquo;ah, books which contain shirk, and all kinds of reprehensible and haraam actions which go against Islamic \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. The evildoer and the one who gives him protection are equally guilty of sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Visiting the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque is an act \r\n    that is Sunnah; it is not an obligatory action and has nothing to do with Hajj, nor is it an action that is required in order for Hajj to be \r\n    complete.&nbsp; All the ahaadeeth which say that it is connected to Hajj or that say that visiting the grave of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) is&nbsp; connected to Hajj are fabricated and false. Whoever travels to Madeenah for the purpose of visiting the Mosque and \r\n    praying therein, his intention is acceptable and his efforts will be rewarded.&nbsp; Whoever travels there only for the purpose of visiting the graves \r\n    and seeking the help of their occupants, his intention is haraam and his actions are reprehensible. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not travel to visit any mosques except three: al-Masjid al-Haraam \r\n    [in Makkah], this Mosque of mine [in Madeenah] and al-Masjid al-Aqsa [in Jerusalem].&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1189; Muslim, 1397.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best places to which a person may \r\n    travel are this Mosque of mine, and the Ancient House (i.e., the Ka&rsquo;bah).&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, 3\/350; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>\r\n    al-Silsilah al-Saheehah<\/i>, 1648.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Prayers offered in the Mosque of Madeenah \r\n    bring a multiple reward, both obligatory and naafil prayers according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than one thousand prayers offered anywhere else, except \r\n    al-Masjid al-Haraam.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1190; Muslim, 1394.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But offering naafil prayers at home is better \r\n    than offering them in the mosque, even if the reward for offering them in the Mosque is multiplied, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;The best prayers are those that a man offers in his home, apart from the prescribed [obligatory] prayers.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by al-Bukhaari, 731; Muslim, 781.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The visitor to this great Mosque should \r\n    note that it is not permissible to seek blessing (barakah) from any part of the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque, such as the pillars, walls, doors, mihraab or \r\n    minbar, by touching or kissing them. It is also not permitted to seek blessing from the Prophet&rsquo;s hujrah (chamber) by touching it, kissing it, or \r\n    wiping one's clothes against it or to circumambulate it. Whoever does any of these things has to repent and not repeat it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; It is prescribed for the one who visits \r\n    the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs in the Rawdah or whatever he wants of naafil prayers, because it is proven that there is virtue in doing \r\n    so. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The area between my house and my \r\n    minbar is one of the gardens (<i>riyaad<\/i>, sing. <i>rawdah<\/i>) of Paradise, and my minbar is on my cistern (<i>hawd<\/i>)&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari, 1196; Muslim, 1391.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it was narrated that Yazeed ibn Abi \r\n    &lsquo;Ubayd said: &ldquo;I used to come with Salamah ibn al-Akwa&rsquo; and he would pray by the pillar which was by the mus-haf, i.e. in the Rawdah. I said, &lsquo;O \r\n    Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar!&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I saw that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \r\n    keen to pray here.&rsquo;&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 502; Muslim, 509.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Being keen to pray in al-Rawdah does not \r\n    justify being aggressive towards people or pushing the weak aside, or stepping over their necks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; It is prescribed for the visitor to \r\n    Madeenah and for the one who lives there to go to the Mosque of Quba&rsquo; and pray there, following the example of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking the reward of &lsquo;Umrah. It was narrated that Sahl ibn Haneef said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque &ndash; meaning the Mosque of Quba&rsquo; &ndash; and prays there, that \r\n    will be equivalent to &lsquo;Umrah.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, 3\/437; al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 699; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb<\/i>, 1180, \r\n    1181.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>According to Ibn Maajah: &ldquo;Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the Mosque of \r\n    Quba&rsquo; and prays there, he will have the reward of &lsquo;Umrah.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1412.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> it is narrated that \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go to the mosque of Quba&rsquo; every Saturday, walking or riding, and \r\n    he would pray two rak&rsquo;ahs there. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1191; Muslim, 1399&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; For the visitor to Madeenah, it is not \r\n    prescribed to visit any other mosques in the city apart from these two, the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) and the Mosque of Quba&rsquo;. It is not prescribed for the visitor or anyone else to head for a particular spot, hoping for blessing or to \r\n    worship Allaah in that place, when there is no evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah concerning visiting that place and no evidence that the \r\n    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not prescribed to go to the places and \r\n    mosques in which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the Sahaabah prayed in order to pray there or to worship Allaah \r\n    by offering du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s there etc., because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not enjoin that or encourage people to \r\n    visit these places. It was narrated that al-Ma&rsquo;roor ibn Suwayd (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: We went out with &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab, and we \r\n    passed by a mosque on the way. The people hastened to pray there, and &lsquo;Umar said, &ldquo;What is the matter with them?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;This is a mosque in \r\n    which the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed.&rdquo; &lsquo;Umar said, &ldquo;O people, those who came before you were \r\n    doomed because they followed such practices, until they established places of worship in such locations. If a time for prayer comes when you are \r\n    there, then pray, and if it is not the time for prayer, then move on.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>, 7550.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab heard that there \r\n    were people who came to the tree under which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had received the bay&rsquo;ah (oath of \r\n    allegiance), he ordered that it be cut down. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>, 7545.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>8 &ndash; It is prescribed for men who are visiting \r\n    the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque to visit the grave of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the graves of his two companions Abu \r\n    Bakr and &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them), and to send salaams upon them and make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for them. But for women it is not permissible for \r\n    them to visit graves according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (3236), \r\n    al-Tirmidhi (3236) and Ibn Maajah (1575) from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who visit graves. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Islaah al-Masaajid<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And al-Tirmidhi (1056) narrated from Abu \r\n    Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan \r\n    saheeh.

It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: When \r\n    death was approaching the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he put a cloak over his face, and when he felt hot \r\n    he removed it and said, &ldquo;May Allaah&rsquo;s curse be upon the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship&rdquo; &ndash; \r\n    warning against doing what they did.

In order for Hajj to be obligatory \r\n    for a woman, it is essential for her to have a mahram with her, and it is \r\n    not permissible for her to travel for Hajj, whether that is obligatory or \r\n    naafil Hajj, without a mahram, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No woman should travel except with a mahram.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1862; Muslim 1341.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The mahram is her husband or one whom it is permanently \r\n    forbidden for her to marry because of blood ties, breastfeeding or ties \r\n    through marriage. The husband of a sister, maternal aunt or paternal aunt is \r\n    not a mahram. Some women take this matter lightly and travel with their \r\n    sister and sister&rsquo;s husband, or with a maternal aunt and the aunt&rsquo;s husband, \r\n    but this is haraam, because the sister&rsquo;s husband or the maternal aunt&rsquo;s \r\n    husband is not a mahram, so it is not permissible for her to travel with \r\n    him. So there is the fear that her Hajj is not proper, for the proper Hajj \r\n    (Hajj mabroor) is that which is not mixed with any sin, but this woman is \r\n    sinning throughout her journey until she returns home.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also essential that the mahram be an adult of sound \r\n    mind, because the aim of the mahram is to protect the woman, and a child or \r\n    one who is insane cannot do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a woman does not have a mahram, or she has one but he is \r\n    unable to travel with her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The husband&rsquo;s permission is not an essential condition of it \r\n    being obligatory for a woman to do Hajj, rather she is obliged to do Hajj \r\n    when the conditions of it being obligatory are met, even if her husband does \r\n    not give permission.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee said (11\/20):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The obligatory Hajj is obligatory when the conditions of \r\n    being able to do it are met, and the husband&rsquo;s permission is not one of \r\n    them.

The one who enters ihraam has to do all the actions of \r\n    Hajj, but she should not circumambulate the House until her period ends and \r\n    she does ghusl. The same applies to women who are bleeding following \r\n    childbirth. If they do all the essential parts of Hajj then their Hajj is \r\n    valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah li&rsquo;l-Buhooth al-&lsquo;Ilmiyyah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Ifta&rsquo;<\/i>, 11\/172-173.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a woman intends to do &lsquo;umrah, it is not permissible for \r\n    her to pass the meeqaat without entering ihraam, even if she is \r\n    menstruating. So she should enter ihraam even if she is menstruating and her \r\n    ihraam is valid. The evidence for that is the fact that Asma&rsquo; bint &lsquo;Umays, \r\n    the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) gave birth, when \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was camped at \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Hulayfah on his way to perform the Farewell Pilgrimage. She sent word \r\n    to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asking him \r\n    what she should do. He said: &ldquo;Do ghusl and tie a piece of cloth around \r\n    yourself and enter ihraam.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The blood of menstruation is like the blood of nifaas. So we \r\n    say to the menstruating woman: if she passes the meeqaat and she intends to \r\n    do &lsquo;Umrah or Hajj, we say to her: Do ghusl, tie a piece of cloth around \r\n    yourself and enter ihraam. What is meant by tying a piece of cloth is \r\n    placing a piece of cloth over the vagina and tying it in place, then \r\n    entering ihraam whether for Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah. But when she enters ihraam and \r\n    reaches Makkah, she should not go to the Ka&rsquo;bah or circumambulate it until \r\n    she becomes pure. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, when she menstruated during &lsquo;umrah: &ldquo;Do \r\n    everything that the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until \r\n    you become pure.&rdquo; This report was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. \r\n    According to <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah stated that when she became \r\n    pure she circumambulated the House and did saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and \r\n    al-Marwah. This indicates that if a woman enters ihraam for Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    when she is menstruating, or her period comes before she does tawaaf, then \r\n    she should not do tawaaf or saa&rsquo;i until she becomes pure and does ghusl. But \r\n    if she did tawaaf when she was pure and after she finished tawaaf her period \r\n    came, then she should continue and do saa&rsquo;i even if she is menstruating, and \r\n    she should cut her hair and end her &lsquo;umrah, because tahaarah (purity) is not \r\n    essential for saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and al-Marwah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sittoon Su&rsquo;aalan fi&rsquo;l-Hayd<\/i>, \r\n    question no. 54.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows \r\n    best<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7336","question_id":"7336","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a menstruating woman passes the meeqaat with the intention \r\n    of doing Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah, she is obliged to enter ihraam from the meeqaat.

There is scholarly consensus on this \r\n    point.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When menstruating women and \r\n    women who are bleeding following childbirth come to the meeqaat, they should \r\n    do ghusl and enter ihraam and do all the rituals apart from Tawaaf around \r\n    the Ka&rsquo;bah.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1744; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n    in <i>Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, \r\n    1\/447:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded menstruating women and women \r\n    who were bleeding following childbirth to enter ihraam and recite the \r\n    Talbiyah etc, and to attend &lsquo;Arafah and recite dhikr and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and to \r\n    stone the Jamaraat remembering Allaah, and so on. He did not regard it as \r\n    makrooh for them to do that, rather that is obligatory for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (16\/126):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When a menstruating woman or a woman who is bleeding \r\n    following childbirth reaches the meeqaat, it is obligatory for her to enter \r\n    ihraam, if that is for an obligatory Hajj or &lsquo;umrah. If it is a voluntary \r\n    pilgrimage and she has already performed the Hajj and &lsquo;umrah that are \r\n    required in Islam, then it is prescribed for her to enter ihraam from the \r\n    meeqaat just like other women who are pure (i.e., not menstruating or \r\n    bleeding following childbirth).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A woman whose period \r\n    begins before she enters ihraam can enter ihraam while menstruating, because \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Asma&rsquo; \r\n    bint &lsquo;Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both), \r\n    who gave birth at Dhu&rsquo;l-Hulayfah, to do ghusl and tie a cloth around \r\n    herself, and enter ihraam. The same applies to menstruating women, and they \r\n    should remain in ihraam until they become pure (i.e., until their period or \r\n    nifaas ends and they do ghusl), then they should do tawaaf around the Ka&rsquo;bah \r\n    and saa&rsquo;i.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sittoon Su&rsquo;aalan fi Ahkaam al-Hayd<\/i>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7337","question_id":"7337","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>There is nothing wrong with a menstruating \r\n    woman or a woman who is bleeding following childbirth reciting the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s that are prescribed during the rituals of Hajj.

Some women are ignorant of \r\n    the fact that Hajj is obligatory for them; some know that but they procrastinate until death takes them unawares and they have failed to go for \r\n    Hajj; and some of them do not understand any of the rituals so they do things that are haraam and may even invalidate their Hajj without \r\n    realizing. Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hajj is a duty that Allaah has enjoined upon \r\n    His slaves, it is the fifth pillar of Islam and it is the jihad of women, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her): &ldquo;Your jihad is Hajj.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There follows some advice and the rulings \r\n    that apply specifically to women who want to do Hajj. These are things that will help to make your Hajj acceptable, and an accepted Hajj, as the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;brings no less a reward than Paradise.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Sincerity towards Allaah is a condition \r\n    of any act of worship, including Hajj, being valid and acceptable. So be sincere towards Allaah in your Hajj and beware of showing off, for \r\n    showing off invalidates good deeds and brings punishment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Following the Sunnah and doing actions in \r\n    accordance with the teachings of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the second condition of actions being valid and \r\n    acceptable, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with \r\n    this matter of ours, will have it rejected.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This means that you should learn the rulings \r\n    of Hajj according to the Sunnah of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), with the help of useful books which are based on \r\n    saheeh evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Beware of major and minor shirk \r\n    (association of others with Allaah), and of sin in all its forms. Major shirk means that a person goes beyond the pale of Islam, his good deeds \r\n    are rendered invalid and that he is exposed to punishment. Minor shirk means that a person&rsquo;s good deeds are rendered invalid and he is exposed to \r\n    punishment. Sin means that he is exposed to punishment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; It is not permissible for a woman to \r\n    travel for Hajj or for any other purpose without a mahram, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No woman \r\n    should travel without a mahram.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The mahram is the husband or any man whom a \r\n    woman is forever forbidden to marry because of blood ties or radaa&rsquo;ah (ties that result from breastfeeding) or ties through marriage. This is one \r\n    of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory for women. If a woman does not have a mahram to travel with her, then she does not have to do Hajj.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; A woman may enter ihraam in whatever \r\n    clothes she likes, black or any other colour, so long as she avoids wanton display (tabarruj) or clothes of fame and vanity such as tight, \r\n    see-through, short, thin or decorated clothes. Women must also be careful to avoid clothes that resemble the clothes of men or the kuffaar.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence we know that there is no evidence for \r\n    the practice of some of the common folk of choosing a specific colour for women to wear in ihraam, such as green or white; rather this is a kind \r\n    of bid&rsquo;ah (innovation).<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; After forming the intention for ihraam, \r\n    it is haraam for the muhrimah (woman in ihraam) to put on any kind of perfume, whether on the body or clothes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; It is haraam for the muhrimah to remove \r\n    any hair from her head or body by any means, and to clip the nails.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>8 &ndash; It is haraam for the muhrimah to wear the \r\n    burqa&rsquo; or niqaab (kinds of face-veils), and to wear gloves, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Women \r\n    (during Hajj) should not wear niqaab or gloves.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>9 &ndash; The muhrimah should not uncover her face \r\n    or hands in front of non-mahram men using the excuse that the niqaab and gloves are among the things that are forbidden in ihraam, because they \r\n    can cover their faces and hands with anything such as their clothes, scarves, etc. Umm al-Mu&rsquo;mineen &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ihraam. When \r\n    they came alongside us we would lower our jilbaabs from our heads over our faces, and when they had passed by we would uncover them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Narrated by \r\n    Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Hijaab al-Mar&rsquo;ah al-Muslimah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>10 &ndash; Some women, when they enter ihraam, put \r\n    something like a turban or clips on their heads, so that no part of the khimaar or jilbaab will cover their faces. This is going to trouble for \r\n    which there is no need, because there is nothing wrong with the cover touching the face of the muhrimah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>11 &ndash; It is permissible for the muhrimah to \r\n    wear a shirt, pants, socks on the feet, gold bangles and rings, watches, etc, but she should cover her adornments in front of non-mahram men \r\n    during Hajj and at other times.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>12 &ndash; Some women, if they pass the meeqaat \r\n    with the intention of doing Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah and happen to be menstruating, do not enter ihraam, thinking that it is a condition of ihraam to be \r\n    free of menstruation. So they pass the meeqaat without entering ihraam. This is an obvious mistake, because menstruation does not mean that a \r\n    woman cannot enter ihraam. So a menstruating woman should enter ihraam and do everything that other pilgrims do, apart from tawaaf around the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah. She should delay tawaaf until she becomes pure (i.e., until her period ends). If she delays ihraam and passes the meeqaat without entering \r\n    ihraam, then she has to go back and enter ihraam from the meeqaat; if she does not go back then she has to offer a sacrifice because she failed to \r\n    do something that was obligatory upon her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>13 &ndash; If a woman fears that she may not be \r\n    able to complete the rituals of Hajj, she may stipulate a condition when entering ihraam by saying, &ldquo;If I am prevented (from completing Hajj), \r\n    then I will exit ihraam at the point at which I am prevented.&rdquo; Then if something happens to prevent her from completing Hajj, she will exit ihraam \r\n    and there will be no blame on her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>14 &ndash; Remember the actions of Hajj:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span>\r\n    <span>When the day of al-Tarwiyah comes, which is the eighth day of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, do ghusl and enter ihraam, and recite \r\n    the Talbiyah, saying, &ldquo;<i>Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk.

The time for reciting the Talbiyah starts from after entering \r\n    ihraam for Hajj and lasts until one stones the Jamrat al-&lsquo;Aqabah on the Day of Sacrifice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>16 &ndash; If a woman&rsquo;s period \r\n    begins after she has done tawaaf and before she does saa&rsquo;i, she should complete the rest of the rituals and do saa&rsquo;i even if she is menstruating, \r\n    because tahaarah (purity) is not essential for saa&rsquo;i.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>17 &ndash; It is permissible \r\n    for a woman to use pills to delay menstruation to enable her to perform the rituals of Hajj, subject to the condition that this will not cause her \r\n    harm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>18 &ndash; Beware of crowding \r\n    with men in all the rituals of Hajj, especially during tawaaf and at the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner, during saa&rsquo;i and when stoning the \r\n    Jamaraat. Choose times when there is less crowding. Umm al-Mu&rsquo;mineen &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to do tawaaf in an area away \r\n    from the men, and she did not touch the Black Stone or the Yemeni Corner if there was crowding.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>19 &ndash; Women do not have \r\n    to walk quickly (raml) during tawaaf or jog (rakd) during saa&rsquo;i. Raml means walking quickly in the first three circuits of tawaaf, and rakd means \r\n    jogging between the two green markers in every circuit of saa&rsquo;i. These actions are Sunnah for men only.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>20 &ndash; Beware of this \r\n    small book which contains innovated du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s, such as a specific du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for each circuit of tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i for which there is no evidence from \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. It is prescribed to recite du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; during tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i however one wishes, for the best in this world and in the \r\n    Hereafter. If the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is one that is narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that is even better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>21 &ndash;A woman who is \r\n    menstruating can read books of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and dhikr that are prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah, even if they contain verses of Qur&rsquo;aan. It is also permissible \r\n    for her to recite Qur&rsquo;aan without touching the Mus-haf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>22 &ndash; Beware of \r\n    uncovering any part of your body, especially in places where men could see you, such as public wudoo&rsquo; areas. Some women do not care about men \r\n    being close to such areas and they uncover during wudoo&rsquo; things that it is not permissible to uncover, such as the face, forearms and calves. They \r\n    may even take off their headcovers, thus uncovering their heads and necks. All of that is haraam and is not permissible, because it causes a great \r\n    deal of fitnah (temptation) to them and to men.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>23 &ndash; It is permissible \r\n    for women to leave Muzdalifah before dawn, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed some women, especially \r\n    those who were weak, to leave Muzdalifah after the moon had set at the end of the night. That was so that they could stone Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah \r\n    before it became crowded. In <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> it is narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that Sawdah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with her) asked the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the night of Muzdalifah for permission to leave before it became \r\n    too crowded, because she was a heavy woman, and he gave her permission.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;24 &ndash; It is permissible \r\n    to delay stoning the Jamrah until the night, if the woman&rsquo;s guardian thinks that the crowding is too great around Jamrat al-&lsquo;Aqabah and that this \r\n    may pose a danger to the women who are with him. So it is permissible to delay their stoning of the Jamrah until the crowding is less or has \r\n    stopped, and there is nothing wrong with them doing that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The same applies with \r\n    regard to stoning of the Jamaraat during the three days of Tashreeq, when women can stone them after &lsquo;Asr, which is the time when the crowding is \r\n    a lot less, as is well known. If that is not possible then there is nothing wrong with them delaying it until the night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>25 &ndash; Beware of the \r\n    following point: it is not permissible for a woman to allow her husband to have intercourse with her or to be intimate with her so long as she has \r\n    not yet exited ihraam completely. This exiting ihraam is achieved when three things take place:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span>\r\n    <span>Stoning Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah with seven pebbles.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Cutting the length of a fingertip from all ends of the hair, which is approximately 2 centimeters.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Doing the tawaaf of Hajj (tawaaf al-ifaadah).<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Once a woman has done these three things it is permissible to do all the things that were forbidden \r\n    to her during ihraam, including intercourse.

The evidence for that is the fact that Asma&rsquo; bint &lsquo;Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them both) had given birth, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had stopped in Dhu&rsquo;l-Hulayfah on his way to the \r\n    Farewell Pilgrimage.

Is what she did correct? What is the ruling on what she did \r\n    of the things that are forbidden during ihraam?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: What she did is not correct, because if a person \r\n    starts to do &lsquo;umrah or Hajj, it is haraam for him to cancel it unless he has \r\n    a valid shar&rsquo;i reason. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And perform properly [or complete], the Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:196]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So this woman has to repent to Allaah for what she did, but \r\n    her &lsquo;umrah is valid because even though she cancelled it, it cannot be \r\n    cancelled. This is one of the unique characteristics of Hajj. Hajj has \r\n    unique characteristics that are not present in any other act of worship. If \r\n    a person intends to cancel Hajj it does not become cancelled, but if a \r\n    person intends to cancel any other act of worship it does become cancelled. \r\n    If a person is fasting then he decides to cancel his fast, his fast is \r\n    cancelled, and if a person decides to cancel his wudoo&rsquo; whilst doing it, his \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; is cancelled. But if a person is doing &lsquo;umrah and decides to cancel \r\n    it, it does not become cancelled, and if he decides to cancel Hajj whilst \r\n    putting on the Hajj garments, it does not become cancelled. Hence the \r\n    scholars said that the rituals of Hajj and &lsquo;umrah do not be cancelled even \r\n    of a person decides to cancel them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this we say: this woman is still in a state of \r\n    ihraam from the moment she formed the intention until she completes &lsquo;umrah. \r\n    Her intention to cancel it does not have any effect, rather she remains in \r\n    that state.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: with regard to this woman we say that her &lsquo;umrah \r\n    is valid, but she should not cancel ihraam again, because if she cancels \r\n    ihraam that does not count.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the things \r\n    she did that are haraam when in ihraam, let us assume that her husband had \r\n    intercourse with her at this time, and intercourse when in ihraam is the \r\n    most serious of the forbidden things.

The tawaaf of arrival (tawaaf al-qudoom) is Sunnah, and if he wants he may do saa&rsquo;i after the tawaaf of \r\n    arrival as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, or if he wants he may delay it until the day of Eid, after tawaaf \r\n    al-ifaadah. But it is better to do it sooner because that is what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. When the day \r\n    of Eid comes, he should do tawaaf al-ifaadah only, and not saa&rsquo;i, because he has already done saa&rsquo;i. The evidence that one tawaaf and one saa&rsquo;i is \r\n    sufficient for both Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah is the words of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with her) when she was doing qiraan Hajj: &ldquo;Your tawaaf around the House and (your saa&rsquo;i) between al-Safa and al-Marwah is enough \r\n    for your Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1897&rsquo; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>al-Silsilah al-Saheehah<\/i>, 1984. Thus the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that one tawaaf and one saa&rsquo;i in the case of qiraan is sufficient for both Hajj and \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah. <i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i>, p. 563.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7390","question_id":"7390","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      1 &ndash; Hajj is of three types: <i>Ifraad<\/i>, <i>Tamattu&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n      and <i>Qiraan<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    Ifraad<\/i> is when one does Hajj on its \r\n    own (without &lsquo;Umrah). <i>Tamattu&rsquo;<\/i> means doing &lsquo;Umrah, then exiting the \r\n    state of <i>ihraam<\/i>, then doing Hajj. <i>Qiraan<\/i> means doing Hajj and \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah together with one <i>ihraam<\/i> (only entering ihraam once for both), \r\n    in which one Tawaaf and one Sa&rsquo;ee is sufficient for both Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from &lsquo;Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with her) said: &ldquo;We set out with the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) shortly before the \r\n    appearance of the new moon of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah and he said, &lsquo;Whoever wants to \r\n    assume <i>ihraam<\/i> for &lsquo;Umrah may do so, and whoever wants to assume <i>\r\n    ihraam<\/i> for Hajj may do so.

He drove a <i>\r\n    Hadiy<\/i> (sacrificial animal) along with him from Dhu&rsquo;l-Hulayfah. The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) started \r\n    by assuming <i>Ihram<\/i> for 'Umrah, then for Hajj.

Some of them brought the <i>Hadiy<\/i> (sacrificial animals) and \r\n    drove it along with them, whilst the others did not. So, when the Prophet \r\n    SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached Makkah, he said to \r\n    the people, &lsquo;Whoever among you has driven the <i>Hadiy<\/i>, should not \r\n    finish his <i>ihraam<\/i> till he completes his Hajj.

When the \r\n    pilgrim reaches Makkah he performs tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i for &lsquo;Umrah, and shaves his head or cuts his hair, and exits ihraam. Then when the day of \r\n    al-Tarwiyah, which is the 8<sup>th<\/sup> of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, comes, he enters ihraam for Hajj only, and does all the actions of Hajj. So Tamattu&rsquo; \r\n    involves a complete &lsquo;Umrah and a complete Hajj.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ifraad means entering ihraam for Hajj only. \r\n    When the pilgrim reaches Makkah he performs tawaaf al-qudoom (tawaaf of arrival) and saa&rsquo;i for Hajj, but he does not shave or cut his hair and \r\n    does not exit ihraam, rather he remains in ihraam until he exits ihraam after stoning Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah on the day of Eid.&nbsp; If he delays the \r\n    saa&rsquo;i of Hajj until after the tawaaf of Hajj, there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Qiraan means entering ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah and \r\n    Hajj both together. Or entering ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah first then including Hajj in that before starting the tawaaf of Hajj. That is done by intending \r\n    that his tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i will be for both Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The actions done in Qiraan are the same as \r\n    those done in Ifraad, except that the pilgrim doing Qiraan has to offer a hadiy (sacrifice) whereas the pilgrim doing Ifraad does not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The best of these three types of Hajj is \r\n    Tamattu&rsquo;. This is what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined upon his companions and urged them to do. Even if a \r\n    person enters ihraam for Qiraan or Ifraad, then it is strongly recommended for him to change his intention to &lsquo;Umrah, then complete &lsquo;Umrah and \r\n    exit ihraam, so that he will then be doing Tamattu&rsquo;. He may do that after doing tawaaf al-qudoom and saa&rsquo;i&nbsp; &ndash; because when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i during his Farewell Pilgrimage, and his companions were with him, he told everyone who \r\n    did not have a sacrificial animal (hadiy) to change his intention and make his ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah and to cut his hair and exit ihraam, and he said, \r\n    &ldquo;Were it not that I have brought the hadiy with me, I would do what I have commanded you to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ihraam&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The pilgrim should observe the Sunnahs of ihraam which are \r\n    mentioned in the question referred to above, namely doing ghusl, applying perfume and praying. Then he should enter ihraam after he finishes the \r\n    prayer or after boarding his means of transportation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then if he is doing Tamattu&rsquo;, he should say, \r\n    &ldquo;<i>Labbayk Allaahumma bi &lsquo;Umrah<\/i> (Here I am, O Allaah, for &lsquo;Umrah).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he is doing Qiraam, he should say, &ldquo;<i>Labbayk \r\n    Allaahumma bi Hijjah wa &lsquo;Umrah<\/i> (Here I am, O Allaah, for Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he is doing Ifraad, he should say, &ldquo;<i>Labbayk \r\n    Allaahumma Hajjan<\/i> (Here I am, O Allaah, for Hajj).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should say, &ldquo;<i>Allaahumma haadhihi \r\n    hijjah laa riyaa&rsquo;a fiha wa la sum&rsquo;ah<\/i> (O Allaah, this is a pilgrimage in which there is no showing off or seeking reputation).&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should recite the Talbiyah as the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did: &ldquo;<i>Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Dubaa&rsquo;ah bint al-Zubayr, when she wanted to enter ihraam but she was sick, to stipulate such a \r\n    condition, and he said, &ldquo;Your condition is valid with your Lord.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5089) and Muslim (1207).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he stipulates this condition and something \r\n    happens to prevent him from completing his pilgrimage, then he exits his ihraam and does not have to do anything (i.e., offer a sacrifice in \r\n    compensation).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But the one who does not fear that some \r\n    obstacle may prevent him from completing his pilgrimage does not have to stipulate any conditions, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) did not stipulate conditions nor did he command everyone to do so. Rather he told Dubaa&rsquo;ah bint al-Zubayr to do that \r\n    because she was sick.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The muhrim (person who has entered ihraam) \r\n    should recite the Talbiyah a great deal, especially when circumstances and times change, such as when going up to a high place or going down to a \r\n    low place, or when night or day begin. After that he should ask Allaah for His good pleasure and for Paradise, and seek refuge in His Mercy from \r\n    the Fire.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Talbiyah is prescribed in &lsquo;Umrah from the \r\n    moment one enters ihraam until one starts Tawaaf. In Hajj it is prescribed from the moment one enters ihraam until one stones Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah \r\n    on the day of Eid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ghusl when entering Makkah&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the pilgrim approaches Makkah, he should \r\n    do ghusl before entering, if possible, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl before entering Makkah. \r\n    Narrated by Muslim, 1259.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then when he enters al-Masjid al-Haraam he \r\n    should do so with his right foot first, and say, &ldquo;<i>Bismillaah wa&rsquo;l-salaatu wa&rsquo;l-salaam &lsquo;ala Rasool-Allaah.

If he shaves his head he must shave his entire head, \r\n    and if he cuts his hair he must cut from all over his head. Shaving is better than cutting because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) made du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair. Narrated by Muslim, 1303.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But if the time of Hajj is so close that \r\n    there will be no time for the hair to grow back, then it is better to cut one&rsquo;s hair at this point, so that there will be some hair left to shave \r\n    during Hajj. The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded his companions, during \r\n    the Farewell Pilgrimage, to cut their hair during &lsquo;Umrah, because they arrived on the morning of the 4<sup>th<\/sup> of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Women should cut the length of a fingertip \r\n    from their hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With these actions, the &lsquo;Umrah of the one who \r\n    is doing Tamattu&rsquo; is concluded, after which he should exit ihraam completely and do everything that those who are not in ihraam do, such as \r\n    wearing regular clothes, wearing perfume, having intercourse with their wives, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Those who are doing Ifraad or Qiraan should \r\n    not shave their heads or cut their hair, or exit ihraam, rather they should remain in ihraam until they exit ihraam on the day of Eid, after \r\n    stoning Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah and shaving their heads or cutting their hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then when the day of al-Tarwiyah comes, which \r\n    is the 8<sup>th<\/sup> day of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, the one who is doing Tamattu&rsquo; should enter ihraam for Hajj in the morning from the place where he is in \r\n    Makkah. It is mustahabb for him to do the same when entering ihraam for Hajj as he did when entering ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah, namely doing ghusl, \r\n    putting on perfume and praying. He should form the intention of entering ihraam for Hajj and recite the Talbiyah, and say, &ldquo;<i>Labbayk Allaahumma \r\n    Hajjan<\/i> (Here I am, O Allaah, for Hajj).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he fears some obstacle that may prevent \r\n    him from completing his Hajj, he should stipulate a condition by saying, &ldquo;If I am prevented then my exiting ihraam is where I am prevented.&rdquo; If he \r\n    does not fear any such obstacle then he should not make any such condition. It is mustahabb to recite the Talbiyah out loud until he starts to \r\n    stone Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah on the day of Eid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Going to Mina&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then the pilgrim should go out to Mina and \r\n    pray Zuhr, &lsquo;Asr, Maghrib, &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; and Fajr there, shortening the prayers but not joining them, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to shorten his prayers in Mina but he did not join them. Shortening the prayers means making the four-rak&rsquo;ah prayers two \r\n    raka&rsquo;ahs. The people of Makkah and others should shorten their prayers in Mina, &lsquo;Arafah and Muzdalifah because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lead the people in prayer during the Farewell Pilgrimage and there were people from Makkah with him, but \r\n    he did not tell them to offer their prayers in full. If it had been obligatory for them to do so, he would have told them to do so as he did on \r\n    the day of the Conquest of Makkah. But since the city has spread and incorporated Mina so that it is like one of the quarters of Makkah, then the \r\n    people of Makkah should not shorten their prayers there. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Going to &lsquo;Arafah&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the sun rises on the day of &lsquo;Arafah, the \r\n    pilgrim travels from Mina to &lsquo;Arafah and stops in Namirah until the time of Zuhr (Namirah is a place just before &lsquo;Arafah), if he can do so. If he \r\n    cannot do it, it does not matter because staying in Namirah is Sunnah but it is not obligatory. When the sun passes its zenith (i.e., when the \r\n    time for Zuhr prayer begins), he should pray Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, two rak&rsquo;ahs each, and join them together at the time of Zuhr, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, so as to leave a lot of time for standing and making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after the prayer he should devote his \r\n    time to making dhikr and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and beseeching Allaah, and praying as he likes, raising his hands and facing the qiblah even if the mountain of \r\n    &lsquo;Arafah is behind him, because the Sunnah is to face the qiblah, not the mountain. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    stood by the mountain and said, &ldquo;I am standing here, but all of &lsquo;Arafah is the place of standing.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Most of the Prophet&rsquo;s du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in that great \r\n    place of standing was: &ldquo;<i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu&rsquo;l-mulk, wa lahu&rsquo;l-hamd, wa huwa &lsquo;ala kulli shay&rsquo;in qadeer<\/i> \r\n    (There is no god but Allaah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, all praise is due to Him, and He is able to do all \r\n    things).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the pilgrim gets tired and wants to have a \r\n    break by talking to his companions about useful things or by reading from some useful books, especially things that have to do with the generosity \r\n    and great bounty of Allaah, in order to increase his hopes on that day, this is good.&nbsp; Then he can go back to beseeching Allaah and praying to \r\n    Him. He should strive to make the most of the end of the day by making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. The best of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; made on the day of &lsquo;Arafah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Going to Muzdalifah&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the sun sets, the pilgrim should go to \r\n    Muzdalifah. When he reaches there, he should pray Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; with one adhaan and two iqaamahs. If he fears that he will not reach \r\n    Muzdalifah before midnight, he should pray on the way, because it is not permissible to delay &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer until after midnight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He should stay overnight in Muzdalifah, then \r\n    when dawn comes he should pray Fajr early, with the adhaan and iqaamah, and then head for al-Mash&rsquo;ar al-Haraam (which is the site of the mosque in \r\n    Muzdalifah) and proclaim the oneness and greatness of Allaah (by saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and Allaahu akbar), and making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; as he likes, \r\n    until it has become very light (i.e., when the light of day appears before the sun has actually risen). If it is not easy for him to go to \r\n    al-Mash&rsquo;ar al-Haraam, he should make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; where he is, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood there and all \r\n    of Muzdalifah is the place of standing. When he is reciting dhikr and making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; he should face the qiblah and raise his hands.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Going to Mina&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When it has become very light, before the sun \r\n    rises, he should go to Mina and hasten through Wadi Mahsar (which is a valley between Muzdalifah and Mina). When he reaches Mina he should stone \r\n    Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah, which is the last one that is closest to Makkah, throwing seven pebbles one after another, each of which should be \r\n    approximately the size of a fava bean, saying &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo; with each throw. (The Sunnah when stoning Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah is to face the Jamarah \r\n    with Makkah to one's left and Mina to one one&rsquo;s right). When he has finished this stoning, he should slaughter his sacrificial animal, then shave \r\n    his head or cut his hair if he is male; women should cut the length of a fingertip from their hair. This is the first stage of exiting ihraam, in \r\n    which it becomes permissible to do everything except have intercourse with one's wife. Then the pilgrim should go back to Makkah and do tawaaf and \r\n    saa&rsquo;i for Hajj. Then comes the second stage of exiting ihraam, after which everything becomes permissible which was forbidden whilst in ihraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Sunnah is to put on perfume when one \r\n    wants to go to Makkah to do tawaaf after stoning the jamarat and shaving one&rsquo;s head, because &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: &ldquo;I \r\n    used to apply perfume to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) before he entered ihraam and when he exited ihraam, before \r\n    he circumambulated the House.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1539; Muslim, 1189.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then after tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i, he should go \r\n    back to Mina and stay there for two night, the 11<sup>th<\/sup> and 12<sup>th<\/sup> of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, and stone the three jamarats during those two \r\n    days, when the sun has passed its zenith. It is better for him to go to the jamarats walking, but if he rides that is acceptable. He should stone \r\n    the first jamarah, which is the one that is furthest away from Makkah and next to Masjid al-Kheef, with seven pebbles, one after another, and say \r\n    &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo; after each throw. Then he should go forward a little and say a lengthy du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, saying whatever he likes. If it is too difficult \r\n    for him to stand for a long time and make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, he should say whatever is easy for him, even if it is only a little, so that he will have done \r\n    the Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should stone the middle jamarah with \r\n    seven pebbles, one after another, saying &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo; with every throw. Then he should move to his left and stand facing the qiblah, raising \r\n    his hands, and offer a lengthy du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; if he can. Otherwise he should stand for as long as he can. He should not omit to stand and make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n    because it is Sunnah. Many people neglect that because of ignorance or because they take the matter lightly. The more the Sunnah is neglected the \r\n    more important it becomes to do it and spread it among the people, lest it be abandoned and die out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should stone Jamarat al-&lsquo;Aqabah with \r\n    seven pebbles, one after another, saying &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo; with each throw, then he should go away and not offer a du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; after that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When he has completed the stoning of the \r\n    Jamaraat on the 12<sup>th<\/sup> day of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah, if he wants he may hasten and leave Mina, and if he wants he may delay his departure and stay \r\n    there for another night, the night of the 13<sup>th<\/sup>, and stone the three Jamaraat after noon as he did before. It is better to delay, but it \r\n    is not obligatory unless the sun has set on the 12<sup>th<\/sup> and he is still in Mina, in which case it is obligatory to stay until one has \r\n    stoned the three Jamaraat after noon on the following day. But if the sun sets on the 12<sup>th<\/sup> and he is still in Mina but not by choice, \r\n    such as if he had already started out and boarded his means of transportation, but got delayed because of crowded conditions and traffic jams \r\n    etc., then he is not obliged to stay there, because the delay until sunset was not by his choice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the pilgrim wants to leave Makkah and go \r\n    back to his country, he should not leave until he has performed the farewell tawaaf (tawaaf al-wadaa&rsquo;), because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No one should leave until the last thing that he does is (tawaaf) around the House.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, \r\n    1327). According to another version, he told the people that the last thing they should do was (tawaaf) around the house, but he made an exception \r\n    for women who were menstruating. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1755; Muslim, 1328.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Women who are menstruating or bleeding \r\n    following childbirth do not have to do the farewell tawaaf; neither should they stand by the door of al-Masjid al-Haraam to bid farewell, because \r\n    that was not narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The last thing the pilgrim should do when he \r\n    wants to leave is to circumambulate the House. If after the farewell tawaaf he stays and waits for his companions or to load his luggage or to buy \r\n    something he needs on the way, there is nothing wrong with that, and he does not have to repeat the tawaaf, unless he intends to delay his \r\n    journey, such as if he intended to travel at the beginning of the day and he did the farewell tawaaf, then he delays his travelling until the end \r\n    of the day, for example; in this case he has to repeat the tawaaf so that it will be the last thing he does in Makkah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Note:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The pilgrim who enters ihraam for Hajj or \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah has to do the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He has to adhere to that which Allaah has enjoined of religious laws, such as praying on time in \r\n    congregation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He has to avoid all that Allaah has forbidden of obscene and immoral speech and sin, because Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So whosoever intends \r\n    to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly \r\n    during the Hajj&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:197]<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He should avoid annoying the Muslims with his words or actions, at the holy sites and elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He should avoid all things that are forbidden when in ihraam:<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>So he should not cut anything from his hair or nails, but removing thorns and the like is fine, even \r\n    if that results in some bleeding.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He should not apply perfume after entering ihraam, either to his body, his clothes, his food or his \r\n    drink.

What is the ruling on the things she did that were \r\n    forbidden in ihraam?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: This action is \r\n    not correct because when a person starts to do Hajj or &lsquo;umrah, it is haraam \r\n    for him to cancel it except for a valid shar&rsquo;i reason. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And perform properly \r\n    (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad\r\n    <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>), the Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah.

But her &lsquo;umrah is valid, because even \r\n    though she cancelled her &lsquo;umrah, it cannot be cancelled.&nbsp; This is something \r\n    that applies only to Hajj and &lsquo;umrah. If the person who is doing &lsquo;umrah \r\n    decides during his &lsquo;umrah to cancel his &lsquo;umrah, it is not cancelled, and if \r\n    he decided to cancel his Hajj during his Hajj, it is not cancelled. Hence \r\n    the scholars said: The pilgrimage cannot be cancelled by intending to cancel \r\n    it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on that, we say: This \r\n    woman is still in a state of ihraam, from the time when she formed the \r\n    intention, until she completes &lsquo;umrah. Her intention to cancel it does not \r\n    have any effect, rather it is still required of her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up: with regard to \r\n    this woman we say: her &lsquo;umrah is valid, but she should not try to cancel \r\n    ihraam again, because if she tries to cancel ihraam she will not free \r\n    herself from it. As for what she has done of things that are forbidden when \r\n    in ihraam, let us assume that her husband has had intercourse with her, and \r\n    intercourse during Hajj or &lsquo;umrah is one of the gravest of these forbidden \r\n    things.

If there is \r\n    too much crowding and a person is far away from the Jamrah and wants to \r\n    delay it until night time, there is nothing wrong with that, but he should \r\n    not delay it until dawn on the eleventh of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to stoning the Jamaraat on the days of \r\n    al-Tashreeq &ndash; the 11<sup>th<\/sup>, 12<sup>th<\/sup> and 13<sup>th<\/sup> of \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah &ndash; that starts after the sun has passed its zenith &ndash; i.e., \r\n    midday when the time for Zuhr begins &ndash; and lasts until nighttime.

That was stated by Imam Ahmad. It was also narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Umar, \r\n    and it was the view of Maalik, al-Thawri, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ishaaq and ashaab \r\n    al-ra&rsquo;i. it was also narrated from al-Hasan and &lsquo;Ata&rsquo;. But Ishaaq and ashaab \r\n    al-ra&rsquo;i granted a concession allowing stoning before the meridian on the day \r\n    of departure and he should not depart until after the meridian. Something \r\n    similar was narrated from Ahmad too. And &lsquo;Ikrimah also granted a concession \r\n    concerning that. Tawoos said: He may stone the Jamaraat before the meridian \r\n    and depart before it too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he quoted the evidence that it is not permissible to \r\n    stone the Jamaraat before the meridian by noting that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only stoned them after the \r\n    meridian, because &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The \r\n    Jamarah is to be stoned after the sun passes the meridian. And when \r\n    describing the Hajj of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him), Jaabir said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoning the Jamarah at the forenoon on the \r\n    day of Sacrifice, and after that he stoned it after the sun had passed the \r\n    meridian. And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Learn from me your rituals (of Hajj).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: We used to wait until the sun passed its \r\n    meridian, then we stoned (the Jamaraat). Any time a person stones the \r\n    Jamaraat after the meridian is acceptable, but it is mustahabb to hasten to \r\n    do it when the sun passes the meridian, as Ibn &lsquo;Umar said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, stoning the Jamaraat after the meridian is \r\n    what is supported by the strongest evidence and by most opinions, and it is \r\n    more on the safe side with regard to worship, because the one who does that, \r\n    his stoning is valid according to scholarly consensus. But if a person \r\n    stones them before the meridian, there is a difference of scholarly opinion \r\n    concerning his stoning, rather it is not valid according to the majority of \r\n    scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what you mentioned about the overcrowding, \r\n    there is overcrowding before the meridian too, especially since many people \r\n    take the matter lightly and follow this weak opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you do the stoning just before &lsquo;Asr or after, there may be \r\n    less crowding.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should noted that it is permissible to stone the Jamaraat \r\n    at night, especially with your elderly mother being there. That is better \r\n    than doing it before the meridian, because there is no evidence that \r\n    suggests that the end of the time for stoning comes at sunset.

He said: \r\n    &ldquo;It does not matter.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no evidence that states the end of the time for \r\n    stoning, which indicates that it may be done at night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is \r\n    no evidence that it is not allowed to stone the Jamaraat at night, and the \r\n    basic principle is that it is permissible. But it is better to stone it \r\n    during the day on the day of Eid and after the meridian on the three days \r\n    (of al-Tashreeq) if possible. Stoning at night is only valid for the day of \r\n    which the sun has set, it is not valid for the day after.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who missed out on stoning the Jamarah on the day of \r\n    Eid may stone it on the night before the eleventh (of Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah) until \r\n    the end of the night; and the one who missed the stoning before sunset on \r\n    the day of the eleventh may stone the Jamaraat after sunset during the night \r\n    before the twelfth; and the one who missed the stoning before sunset on the \r\n    day of the twelfth may stone the Jamaraat after sunset during the night \r\n    before the thirteenth; but the one who missed the stoning before sunset on \r\n    the day of the thirteenth has missed the stoning and must offer a sacrifice, \r\n    because the time for stoning ends altogether at sunset on the thirteenth. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> (16\/144).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: You know about the crowding that affects women at the time of Hajj, \r\n    and they are not able to perform the rituals in some places. The scholars \r\n    have issued fatwas stating that women may stone the Jamaraat at night. Can a \r\n    woman&rsquo;s wali (guardian) go and stone the Jamaraat for himself as well as for \r\n    her, or should he go during the day too, and only accompany her at night? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: The correct view is that stoning the Jamaraat at \r\n    night is permissible, except on the night before Eid, when it is not \r\n    permissible except at the end of the night. Similarly, on the twelfth he \r\n    should not delay it until the night (unless he wants to hasten on), because \r\n    if he delays it until night, he will have to stay until the thirteenth, and \r\n    similarly the stoning on the thirteenth should not be delayed until night, \r\n    because the days of al-Tashreeq end with sunset on the thirteenth. It is \r\n    permissible for people other than women to do the stoning at night, and we \r\n    think that stoning at night, when it is quiet, and doing the stoning with \r\n    the proper focus (khushoo&rsquo;), is better than going to do the stoning by day \r\n    when he does not know whether he will come back to his tent or die, and he \r\n    does the act of worship not as a proper act of worship, but he does it in a \r\n    distracted manner because he is afraid for his life. So we have established \r\n    a principle that is indicated by sharee&rsquo;ah: that preserving the act of \r\n    worship itself is better than preserving its time or place so long as the \r\n    time allows that, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no prayer when food is ready, or when one is \r\n    suppressing the urge to urinate or defecate.&rdquo; If a person is suppressing the \r\n    urge to urinate or defecate, we say to him: Delay the prayer until the end \r\n    of its time and relieve yourself, even though praying at the beginning of \r\n    the time is better; but if you pray when you are suppressing the urge to \r\n    urinate or defecate, you will not be able to attain the proper focus \r\n    (khushoo&rsquo;) that has to do with the act of worship itself. Hence we think \r\n    that at present, stoning the Jamaraat at night is better than doing it \r\n    during the day, because when stoning them during the day one cannot attain \r\n    the proper focus and do the act of worship in the required manner. So it is \r\n    permissible for a man to delay his stoning until night, so that he can go \r\n    with his wife to stone the Jamaraat.

This was stated by \r\n    Imam Ahmad, and it was the view of Maalik. It was narrated from Ahmad that \r\n    part (of the head) is sufficient. Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i said: It is sufficient to cut \r\n    three hairs. Ibn al-Mundhir favoured the view that if a man cuts the hair in \r\n    a manner that may be regarded as hair cutting, it is sufficient. But Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;having your heads shaved&rdquo; [al-Fath \r\n    48:27]<\/i>. This is general in meaning. And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) shaved his entire head, which explains the \r\n    command to shave the head.

So he has to remove his sewn garments now, and \r\n    shave his entire head or cut his hair all over. Thus he will exit ihraam, \r\n    and he does to have to offer any (expiation) for anything that he did during \r\n    this time of the things that are forbidden when in ihraam, because he was \r\n    unaware of the ruling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who cut his \r\n    hair on one side only after doing &lsquo;Umrah, then he went back to his family \r\n    and he found out that what he had done was not correct. What should he do? \r\n    He replied: If he did this out of ignorance, then he has to take off his \r\n    clothes now and put on his ihraam garments, and shave his head completely or \r\n    cut his hair, but what he did may be forgiven, because he was unaware. \r\n    Shaving or cutting the hair does not necessarily have to be done in Makkah, \r\n    rather they may be done in Makkah or elsewhere. But if he did that based on \r\n    a fatwa from a scholar, then he does not have to do anything, because Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;So ask of \r\n    those who know the Scripture , if you know not&rdquo; [al-Nahl 16:43]<\/i>. \r\n    Some scholars think that cutting hair from part of the head is like cutting \r\n    the hair all over the head.

Then we came to the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at his camp in the \r\n    middle of the night, and he said, &lsquo;Have you finished?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; He \r\n    gave his companions permission to move on, and he went out to the Ka&rsquo;bah and \r\n    circumambulated it before Fajr prayer, then he left for Madeenah.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by al-Bukhaari and Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to another report she said: On the night when the \r\n    pilgrims leave Mina and go to al-Mahsab (laylat al-hasbah), I said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, the people are going back having done Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah, \r\n    and am I to go back having done only Hajj?&rdquo; He told &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan to seat \r\n    me behind him on his camel, then he (the narrator) mentioned her &lsquo;Umrah from \r\n    al-Tan&rsquo;eem.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to another report from her: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her on the day of departure: \r\n    &ldquo;The tawaaf you did is sufficient for Hajj &lsquo;Umrah&rdquo; but she insisted, so he \r\n    sent her with &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan to al-Tan&rsquo;eem, and she did &lsquo;Umrah after Hajj. \r\n    According to another report: &ldquo;Your tawaaf around the Ka&rsquo;bah and your saa&rsquo;i \r\n    between al-Safa and al-Marwah will suffice for both your &lsquo;Umrah and your \r\n    Hajj.&rdquo; According to a report narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>: (The \r\n    Prophet) <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was an easy-going \r\n    man, and if she wanted something he would go along with it. So he sent her \r\n    with &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr and she entered ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah from \r\n    al-Tan&rsquo;eem.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this it may be said that the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    is general in application and means that the people of Makkah should enter \r\n    ihraam from Makkah for either Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah performed on its own or for \r\n    Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah together (qiraan); the hadeeth about &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah going out of \r\n    the sanctuary (the Haram) with her brother &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan to enter ihraam \r\n    was a specific command issued by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) to her alone. The well known principle according to the \r\n    scholars is that if there seems to be a contradiction between a general \r\n    ruling and a specific ruling, then the specific outweighs the general, which \r\n    in this case is entering ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah from al-Tan&rsquo;eem, or some other \r\n    place outside the Haram. So the phrase &ldquo;and the people of Makkah from \r\n    Makkah&rdquo; means that the people of Makkah should enter ihraam for Hajj offered \r\n    on its own or for Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah offered together (qiraan) from Makkah, and \r\n    they do not have to go outside the Haram or to one of the other meeqaats \r\n    mentioned in the hadeeth, in order to enter ihraam from there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of &lsquo;Umrah offered on its own, the one who wants \r\n    to enter ihraam and is already in Makkah or within the boundaries of the \r\n    Haram has to go outside the Haram &ndash; to al-Tan&rsquo;eem or elsewhere &ndash; and enter \r\n    ihraam from there. This was the view of the majority of scholars. Al-Muhibb \r\n    al-Tabari said: I do not know of anyone who described Makkah as a meeqaat \r\n    for &lsquo;Umrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the phrase in the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) &ldquo;the people of Makkah can start from Makkah&rdquo; is \r\n    interpreted as referring specifically to those who are performing Hajj \r\n    combined with &lsquo;Umrah (qiraan) or Hajj on its own, not those who are \r\n    performing &lsquo;Umrah on its own.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is supported by the fact that the Prophet (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was never given the choice between two \r\n    things but he always chose the easier option, so long as it was not a sin. \r\n    If entering ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah from inside the Haram was permissible then he \r\n    would have chosen that option for &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, because it would have been \r\n    easier and less burdensome for him and for &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and her brother, and he \r\n    would not have told her to go outside<span> \r\n    the Haram or to al-Tan&rsquo;eem and enter ihraam from there.&nbsp;Rather it would have \r\n    been sufficient for her to go with him <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) when he went to the Ka&rsquo;bah to do the farewell tawaaf, because \r\n    she had already entered ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah from al-Abtah, and she could have \r\n    done tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i of &lsquo;umrah at the same time as he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did the farewell tawaaf. That would have \r\n    been sufficient to fulfil &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah&rsquo;s wishes and put her mind at rest, \r\n    because she wanted to do &lsquo;Umrah on its own without going out of the Haram or \r\n    to some specific place outside the Haram. But the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her to go out to al-Tan&rsquo;eem, and she \r\n    needed a mahram so he sent her brother &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan with her. That \r\n    happened at night when the people need to rest, so the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) designated a place to meet up after \r\n    they had finished. The fact that he did not choose the option of entering \r\n    ihraam from inside the Haram, which would have been easier for everyone \r\n    concerned, and he chose the option of entering ihraam from outside the \r\n    Haram, which is more difficult, indicates that one should enter ihraam for \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah from outside the Haram, and that this is a shar&rsquo;i requirement for the \r\n    one who wants to perform &lsquo;Umrah on its own and is already in the Haram.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some scholars think that in the case of &lsquo;Umrah, even though \r\n    it is Sunnah or obligatory for every Muslim who is accountable and is able \r\n    for it, if a person wants to do &lsquo;Umrah and he is in the Haram, he should do \r\n    it along with Hajj, so he should enter ihraam for Qiraan to do &lsquo;Umrah and \r\n    Hajj together, and he should not go out of the boundaries of the Haram, \r\n    whether to al-Tan&rsquo;eem or elsewhere, to enter ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah on its own, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only \r\n    gave permission for that to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, so as to make her happy, and the \r\n    Sahaabah did not go out of the Haram in order to enter ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah \r\n    from outside its boundaries.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some think that one may enter ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah on its own \r\n    from Makkah and elsewhere in the Haram because of the general meaning of the \r\n    hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I say: he was classed as da&rsquo;eef by some of the huffaaz in \r\n    absolute terms, and by others with regard to what is narrated from him apart \r\n    from that which is narrated by those whose names started with &ldquo; &lsquo;Abd&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this the case with regard to the isnaad of the hadeeth, \r\n    and they did not narrate it except from those in whose narration there is \r\n    some problem, and the senior imams, such as al-Bukhaari and Muslim, rejected \r\n    him, even though this hadeeth speaks about an issue in which there is a \r\n    strong motive to narrate it, this indicates that it has no basis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; With regard to its text, its text is odd, because the \r\n    hadeeth in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> and elsewhere clearly indicate that the first \r\n    stage of exiting ihraam takes place before circumambulating the House, \r\n    without stipulating that it should take place before sunset, such as the \r\n    words of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her): &ldquo;I used to put perfume \r\n    on the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he \r\n    exited ihraam, before he circumambulated the House.&rdquo; It cannot be subject to \r\n    conditions such as those mentioned in this odd hadeeth. Hence al-Tahhaawi \r\n    said in <i>Sharh<\/i> <i>Ma&rsquo;aani al-Athaar<\/i> (2\/229), when he quoted the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with him): This is contrary to \r\n    the hadeeth of Ibn Luhay&rsquo;ah which we mentioned at the beginning of the \r\n    chapter. The hadeeth of Ibn Luhay&rsquo;ah is stronger, because it is mutawaatir.&nbsp; \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; With regard to acting upon it, no one among the ummah, \r\n    imams or common folk, acted upon it except for a small number after the time \r\n    of the Sahaabah, if the reports narrated concerning that can be accepted. \r\n    Al-Tabari said in his book <i>al-Qira li Qaasidi Umm al-Qura<\/i> (p. 472), \r\n    when he quoted the hadeeth: I do not know of anyone who held their view. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Sharh al-Muhadhdhab<\/i> (8\/165) al-Nawawi narrated that \r\n    al-Bayqahi said: I do not know of anyone among the fuqaha&rsquo; who held this \r\n    view. I (al-Nawawi) say it is abrogated and consensus indicates that it is \r\n    abrogated, for consensus neither abrogates nor is abrogated, rather it is \r\n    indicative of some abrogator. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi agreed with al-Bayhaqi that no one has any \r\n    knowledge of any contrary view, rather consensus may be taken as evidence \r\n    that this hadeeth is abrogated, i.e., because the ummah did not act upon it. \r\n    But the claim of al-Nawawi is subject to further discussion because the \r\n    claim that something is abrogated requires proof for the abrogated thing, \r\n    and the hadeeth is not proven in the first place so we cannot say that it is \r\n    abrogated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people narrated that &lsquo;Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, one of the \r\n    seven fuqaha&rsquo;, was of this view, and perhaps it may be understood from the \r\n    report narrated from him by al-Tabari in <i>al-Qira<\/i> (p. 470), that \r\n    perfume is not permissible for the one who has not circumambulated the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah after &lsquo;Arafah even if he has cut his hair. Narrated by Sa&rsquo;eed ibn \r\n    Mansoor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I say that it is very unlikely for &lsquo;Urwah ibn al-Zubayr to \r\n    have said the same as is suggested by the hadeeth of Umm Salamah, and for \r\n    that to have been unknown to the likes of al-Tabari and al-Bayhaqi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by &lsquo;Urwah&rsquo;s view is that it is not permissible \r\n    for a person to put on perfume until he has circumambulated the House. This \r\n    is a well known view, and the dispute concerning that is well known. The \r\n    difference between that and what is implied by the hadeeth of Umm Salamah is \r\n    quite clear: the hadeeth of Umm Salamah indicates that a person may exit \r\n    ihraam before doing tawaaf, but that if a person delays tawaaf until after \r\n    sunset on the day of Eid, then he must go back to a state of ihraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard what al-Tabari narrated from &lsquo;Urwah, this \r\n    indicates that perfume is only permissible after tawaaf, and there is a \r\n    clear difference between the two views.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; What it implies is contrary to what is implied by the \r\n    basic principles of sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What it implies is that when a person has completed an act of \r\n    worship, he can only go back to it with a new intention. This is what makes \r\n    the hadeeth appear weaker. If it were saheeh then it would be obligatory to \r\n    follow it, and there is an exception to every rule. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what Allaah has enabled us to write quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I ask Allaah to help us all to follow the right path, and to \r\n    act in accordance with the Sunnah and the Qur&rsquo;aan, for He is Able to do \r\n    that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from a letter written in the Shaykh&rsquo;s own \r\n    handwriting.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7419","question_id":"7419","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the person who delegated you to stone the Jamaraat on his \r\n    behalf is unable to do it because of the hardship and crowding, it is \r\n    permissible for you to stone them on his behalf.

To sum up, what some pilgrims do, as mentioned \r\n    in the question, is something for which there is no basis in the Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, if we assume that it would difficult for some pilgrims to come back to Makkah on another occasion, and they did ifraad, then in this case it is a matter of necessity so after Hajj they my do &lsquo;umrah in order to fulfil the obligation of &lsquo;umrah &ndash; because &lsquo;umrah is obligatory according to the most correct scholarly opinion. In that case he may go out to al-Tan&rsquo;eem or anywhere else that is outside the boundary of the sanctuary, and enter ihram for &lsquo;umrah from there, then do tawaaf and saa&rsquo;i, and shave his head or cut his hair.

If that is the case, then your tawaaf was \r\n    not valid according to the majority of fuqaha&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But according to the opinion of Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on him) and those who agree with him, your tawaaf is valid.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: if I break my wudoo&rsquo; during tawaaf, what is the ruling?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: If the one who is doing tawaaf breaks his wudoo&rsquo;, \r\n    then he has to go out of tawaaf and do wudoo&rsquo;, then come back and start his \r\n    tawaaf all over again. This is the view of the majority of scholars, because \r\n    one of the conditions of tawaaf is being in a state of purity. But Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said that if he breaks \r\n    his wudoo&rsquo; whilst he is doing tawaaf, he may carry on with his tawaaf and he \r\n    does not have to do wudoo&rsquo;, because wudoo&rsquo; is not one of the conditions of \r\n    tawaaf. What Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said is the \r\n    correct view, because there is no evidence from the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) to suggest that being in a state of purity is \r\n    essential for tawaaf. The most that can be said is that when the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to do tawaaf, he did wudoo&rsquo; \r\n    then did tawaaf. This is what he did, but his actions do not indicate that \r\n    it is obligatory. Similarly, according to the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with her), when she got her menses, the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her: &ldquo;Do what the pilgrims do, apart \r\n    from circumambulating the House.&rdquo; That is because she was menstruating, and \r\n    menses may contaminate the mosque in most cases. Moreover, the menstruating \r\n    woman should not stay in the mosque, as is also the case for one who is \r\n    junub. There is also the hadeeth of Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    her), who got her menses after Hajj and he (the Prophet (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him)) said: &ldquo;Is she detaining us?&rdquo; They said: She has \r\n    already done tawaaf al-ifaadah. He said: &ldquo;Then move on.&rdquo; This indicates that \r\n    if she had been menstruating she would not have done tawaaf. Then one may \r\n    argue that menses is different from minor impurity; the answer is that if \r\n    being in a state of purity (wudoo&rsquo;) was a must for tawaaf, the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have explained that to the \r\n    people, because many people may not be in a state of purity. This is the \r\n    view of Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) and it is the correct \r\n    view and we base our fatwas on this view. But undoubtedly being in a state \r\n    of purity when doing tawaaf is preferable and more on the safe side. But \r\n    sometimes things may happen that are beyond one&rsquo;s control and cause \r\n    hardship, such as on the days when there are huge crowds and he loses his \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;. If we tell him to go and do wudoo&rsquo;, and he goes and does wudoo&rsquo;, \r\n    then comes back and starts all over again, then during tawaaf he loses his \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; again, because he has gas for example, and we tell him to go and do \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;, then come back and start tawaaf all over again, doing wudoo&rsquo; on days \r\n    when there are a lot of crowds is very difficult and it will not be easy for \r\n    a man to leaves? Even if he leaves when will he find a wudoo&rsquo; place that is \r\n    free? Then if he does wudoo&rsquo; and goes back, when will he be able to enter \r\n    again? Enjoining upon the slaves of Allah something for which there is no \r\n    clear evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah, when it involves such great \r\n    hardship, is something for which there is no real justification. It is not \r\n    appropriate for anyone to impose something like this on the slaves of Allah \r\n    without clear evidence. Yes, if the matter is easy, such as at times other \r\n    than Hajj, he could go out and do wudoo&rsquo;, and come back and repeat tawaaf. \r\n    This is something easy and we say that to be on the safe side he should do \r\n    this. Whatever the case, what we think is the same as Shaykh al-Islam (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him), that wudoo&rsquo; is not essential for tawaaf.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> \r\n    (22\/361).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Tawaaf is not valid if done inside the Mas&lsquo;aa, because the \r\n    Mas&lsquo;aa is outside al-Masjid al-Haraam.

That is because \r\n    there are two reports from Imam Ahmad as to whether it is permissible to \r\n    appoint someone else to perform a naafil duty on one's behalf. One report \r\n    says that it is not permissible for a person to appoint someone else to do a \r\n    naafil duty such as Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah on his behalf, whether he is sick or \r\n    healthy. This report seems to be more correct, because acts of worship \r\n    should be done by a person himself, so that he may attain whatever worship \r\n    and humility before Allaah he can attain. You can see the difference between \r\n    a man who does Hajj for himself and a man who gives money to someone else to \r\n    perform Hajj on his behalf. The latter does not gain the benefits of worship \r\n    such as reforming his heart and humbling himself before Allaah. It is more \r\n    like a financial transaction whereby he appoints someone else to buy and \r\n    sell on his behalf. If he is sick and wants to delegate someone to do a \r\n    naafil deed on his behalf, we say that this is not something that is taught \r\n    in the Sunnah. Rather the Sunnah is to appoint someone to do things on one's \r\n    behalf with regard to fard (obligatory) actions only. The difference between \r\n    fard and naafil is that the fard deed is binding upon a person, and if he \r\n    cannot do it then he may appoint someone to do Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah on his \r\n    behalf. But naafil deeds are not obligatory, so it is said: So long as you \r\n    are sick and you have done the obligatory action, then give praise to Allaah \r\n    for that, and spend the money that you wanted to give to someone to do Hajj \r\n    or &lsquo;Umrah on your behalf in other ways; use it to help a poor man who has \r\n    not done the obligatory Hajj yet. That is better for you than saying, &ldquo;Take \r\n    this and do Hajj on my behalf,&rdquo; even if you are sick. As for the obligatory \r\n    Hajj, people are not negligent about it, praise be to Allaah. You can hardly \r\n    find anyone who appoints someone else to do the obligatory Hajj on his \r\n    behalf unless he is unable to do it. This is something that is mentioned in \r\n    the Sunnah, as in the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him), according to which a woman came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, the \r\n    command of Allaah to His slaves to perform Hajj has come when my father is \r\n    an old man who cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Can I perform Hajj on his \r\n    behalf?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Conclusion: There are two reports from Imam Ahmad about \r\n    appointing someone else to perform a naafil duty on one's behalf. One of \r\n    them says that it is not valid, and the other says that it is valid whether \r\n    one is able or not. But in my view it is undoubtedly more correct to say \r\n    that it is not valid to appoint someone to do a naafil deed on one's behalf, \r\n    whether one is able to do it or not. With regard to obligatory Hajj, the \r\n    Sunnah says that the one who is unable to do it and has no hope that the \r\n    situation will change may send someone on his behalf.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka&lsquo;bah) is \r\n    a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for \r\n    one&rsquo;s conveyance, provision and residence)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:97]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The point of acts of worship \r\n    is that each person should do them himself, so that he will submit and \r\n    humble himself before Allaah.

Some of them \r\n    said that it is permissible, and others disallowed it. The most correct view \r\n    in my opinion is that it is not allowed, because it is not permissible for \r\n    anyone to appoint someone else to perform Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah on his behalf if \r\n    that is naafil, because the basic principle concerning acts of worship is \r\n    that each person should do them for himself. Just as no one can appoint \r\n    someone else to fast on his behalf, although if he dies and owes some \r\n    obligatory fasts, his heirs may fast on his behalf, the same applies to \r\n    Hajj, which is an act of worship which a person should do himself, \r\n    physically. It is not a financial act of worship which is intended to \r\n    benefit others. Because it is a physical act of worship which a person must \r\n    do himself, it is not valid if it is done by someone else on his behalf, \r\n    except in the cases mentioned in the Sunnah, but there is no mention in the \r\n    Sunnah of anyone doing a naafil Hajj on behalf of someone else. This is one \r\n    of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him), \r\n    i.e., that it is not valid for a person to appoint someone to perform naafil \r\n    Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah on his behalf, whether he is able to do it or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, the rich who are able to do Hajj \r\n    themselves should do it themselves, because some people spend many years not \r\n    going to Makkah and sending someone else to do Hajj on their behalf every \r\n    year. Thus they miss out on the purpose for which Hajj was prescribed, based \r\n    on their appointing someone else to perform Hajj on their behalf.

Allaah gave them that, but they were stingy \r\n    with the money and turned away from righteousness. &ldquo;<i>So He punished them \r\n    by putting hypocrisy into their hearts<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; until when? &ldquo;<i>till the Day \r\n    whereon they shall meet Him<\/i>&rdquo; i.e., until death. &ldquo;<i>because they broke \r\n    that (covenant with Allaah) which they had promised to Him and because they \r\n    used to tell lies.<\/i>&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In conclusion: beware of making vows, and if you do not make \r\n    vows you will be fine. Do not oblige yourselves to do things that Allaah has \r\n    not obliged you to do except as the result of your own actions. If a person \r\n    has a sick loved one, let him say, &ldquo;O Allaah, heal him.&rdquo; If he wants to sit \r\n    an exam, let him say, &ldquo;O Allaah, grant me success,&rdquo; because some students, \r\n    when they find their studies hard and are afraid that they will fail, \r\n    promise Allaah that they will do various acts of worship if they pass the \r\n    exams. Then when they pass the exams, they start to ask questions and come \r\n    to the scholars asking for a way out from the vow, but there is no way out \r\n    and no other option than to fulfil the vow.

A person who fails to \r\n    do it out of negligence is in grave danger, because some of the scholars \r\n    said that such a person is a kaafir. This view is narrated in one report \r\n    from Ahmad, but the correct view is that neglecting deeds does not make a \r\n    person kaafir except in the case of prayer. &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Shaqeeq (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) &ndash; who was one of the Taabi&rsquo;een &ndash; said: &ldquo;The \r\n    companions of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) did not regard omitting any action as kufr except prayer.&rdquo; The one \r\n    who neglects to do Hajj until he dies is not a kaafir according to the \r\n    correct view, but he is in grave danger.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim has to fear Allaah and hasten to perform Hajj once \r\n    he meets the conditions of it being obligatory, because we must hasten to \r\n    perform all obligatory duties unless there is evidence to the contrary. How \r\n    can a Muslim accept to forsake going to Hajj to the sacred House of Allaah \r\n    when he is able to do it and it is easy for him to get there? How can he \r\n    delay it when he does not know whether he will be able to get there after \r\n    this year? He may become unable to go after he was able, or he may become \r\n    poor after being rich, or he may die when Hajj was obligatory for him, then \r\n    his heirs may neglect to make it up on his behalf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The conditions of Hajj being obligatory are five:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash;&nbsp; Being Muslim, the opposite of which is being a kaafir. \r\n    The kaafir is not obliged to do Hajj, rather if a kaafir were to do Hajj, it \r\n    would not be accepted from him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Being an adult. If a person has not yet reached the age \r\n    of puberty, Hajj is not obligatory for him. If he does Hajj it is valid and \r\n    counts as a voluntary Hajj, and when he reaches adulthood he must do the \r\n    obligatory Hajj, because Hajj before puberty does not fulfil the \r\n    obligation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Being of sound mind, the opposite of which is insanity. \r\n    The one who is insane is not obliged to do Hajj, and Hajj cannot be done on \r\n    his behalf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Being free. A slave is not obliged to perform Hajj, but \r\n    if he does Hajj it is valid and counts as a voluntary Hajj. If he is set \r\n    free, it is obligatory for him to perform the obligatory Hajj, because Hajj \r\n    done before being set free does not fulfil the obligation.

These rituals may be confusing for some who see them and do not \r\n    know the reasons for them, so they may say, &lsquo;This does not make sense.&rsquo; I \r\n    have explained the reasons for them as far as narrated reports go, now I \r\n    will explain to you the meanings behind them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Note that the basis for acts of worship is something rational and \r\n    comprehensible, which is the submission of the slave to his Lord and \r\n    obedience to Him. Prayer involves humility and submission, which is is what \r\n    is meant by the word &lsquo;ibaadah (worship).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Zakaah involves kindness and helping the poor, so its meaning is clear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting means suppressing the desires of the self so that it will be \r\n    obedient to the One Whom it serves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    By honouring the House and going there, and establishing a sanctuary (Haram) \r\n    around it are acts of veneration. Arriving there unkempt and disheveled is \r\n    like a slave turning to his Lord in humility and submission, and that is \r\n    clear. A person feels at ease performing rituals that he understands, and \r\n    that motivates him to do them, but to achieve full submission there are some \r\n    rituals that a person may not understand, so he will not be at ease and will \r\n    not comprehend them. In this case the only motive is to obey the commands of \r\n    Allaah. This is a greater form of humility and submission.&rdquo; See <i>Mutheer \r\n    al-&lsquo;Azm al-Saakin<\/i> (1.285-286).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If this is understood, \r\n    then much of the history of the actions of Hajj before the Messenger \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) is not known to us. In this case it does not matter if we do not know. \r\n    And there are some things concerning whose history a few indications are \r\n    narrated in some texts; we will mention some of these here:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; When was Hajj enjoined? When did Hajj begin?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    &ldquo;And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage).

It \r\n    was mentioned that he said, &ldquo;O Lord, how can I proclaim it to the people \r\n    when my voice does not reach them?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Call and We will convey it.&rdquo; \r\n    So he stood in his maqaam (station) &ndash; or it was said, on the rock, or on \r\n    al-Safa, or on Abu Qubays (a mountain) &ndash; and said: &ldquo;O people, your Lord has \r\n    taken a House, so come to it on pilgrimage.&rdquo; And it was said that the \r\n    mountains lowered themselves so that his voice could reach all parts of the \r\n    earth and those who were still in the wombs or in men&rsquo;s loins also heard, \r\n    and everything that heard him, cities, nomad encampments and trees, and \r\n    everyone whom Allaah has decreed should perform Hajj until the Day of \r\n    Resurrection responded, (saying) Labbayk Allaahumma labbayk (Here I am, O \r\n    Allaah, here I am. This is the summary of what was narrated from Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas, Mujaahid, &lsquo;Ikrimah, Sa&rsquo;eed ibn Jubayr and others among the salaf. \r\n    And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Jawzi, in his book <i>Mutheer al-&lsquo;Azm al-Saakin<\/i> (1\/354) narrated \r\n    something similar, but more briefly, and he attributed it to the narrators \r\n    of Seerah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    This has to do with the history of the enjoining of Hajj before the sending \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him). With regard to the enjoining of Hajj in Islam, there is \r\n    some scholarly difference of opinion concerning that. It was said that it \r\n    was enjoined in 6 AH, or in 7 AH, or in 9 AH, or in 10 AH. Imam Ibn \r\n    al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) was certain that it was enjoined in \r\n    9 or 10 AH. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;There is no dispute that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not perform Hajj after he \r\n    migrated to Madeenah apart from one Hajj, which was the Farewell Pilgrimage. \r\n    And there is no dispute that that occurred in 10 AH&hellip; When the command to \r\n    perform Hajj was revealed, the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hastened to perform Hajj with no \r\n    delay. Because the enjoining of Hajj came at a later stage, in 9 or 10 AH, \r\n    one might say, How can you prove that the command to perform Hajj was \r\n    delayed until 9 or 10 AH? We would say that the first part of Soorah Aal \r\n    &lsquo;Imraan was revealed in the year of delegations (&lsquo;<i>aam al-wufood<\/i>), \r\n    during which the delegation from Najraan came to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he made a treaty with them \r\n    regarding their paying the jizyah, and the (ruling on) jizyah was revealed \r\n    in the year of Tabook, 9 AH, when the first part of Soorat Aal &lsquo;Imraan was \r\n    revealed&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Qurtubi said in his <i>Tafseer<\/i> (2\/4\/92): Hajj was known to the Arabs. \r\n    When Islam came, they were told about something they already knew and what \r\n    was enjoined upon them was something they were familiar with&hellip;&rdquo; See also <i>\r\n    Ahkaam al-Qur&rsquo;aan<\/i> by Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi, 1\/286.

So the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded them to walk quickly (<i>raml<\/i>) \r\n    in the first three circuits&hellip; According to another report, he said, &ldquo;Walk \r\n    quickly so that the mushrikeen will see that you are strong.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; The water of Zamzam and saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and al-Marwah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari narrated in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> (6\/396-397, 3364) that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibraaheem brought Haajar and her son Ismaa&rsquo;eel when she was still \r\n    breastfeeding him, to a place near the Ka&rsquo;bah under a tree on the spot of \r\n    Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was \r\n    nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he left them there and left \r\n    with them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin \r\n    containing some water, and set out homeward. Ismaa&rsquo;eel&rsquo;s mother followed him \r\n    saying, &ldquo;O Ibraaheem! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where \r\n    there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to \r\n    enjoy)?&rdquo; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look at her. \r\n    Then she asked him, &ldquo;Has Allaah commanded you to do this?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; \r\n    She said, &ldquo;Then He will not forsake us,&rdquo; and went back while Abraham \r\n    proceeded onwards. When he reached al-Thaniyah where they could not see him, \r\n    he turned to face the Ka&rsquo;bah, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying \r\n    the following prayer: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    &ldquo;O our Lord!

When the \r\n    water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her \r\n    child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa&rsquo;eel) \r\n    tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and \r\n    found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that \r\n    land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she \r\n    might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from \r\n    al-Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in \r\n    the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the \r\n    valley and reached al-Marwa where she stood and started looking, expecting \r\n    to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running \r\n    between al-Safa and al-Marwa) seven times. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;This is the (origin of) the \r\n    people&rsquo;s saa&rsquo;i (walking) between them between them (i.e. al-Safa and \r\n    al-Marwa).&rdquo; When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice \r\n    and she said to herself &ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; and listened attentively. She heard the voice \r\n    again and said, &ldquo;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; \r\n    have you got something to help me?&rdquo; Then she saw an angel at the place of \r\n    Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), until water appeared. \r\n    She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this \r\n    way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the \r\n    water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;May Allah have mercy on the \r\n    mother of Ismaa&rsquo;eel!

Then he should \r\n    apply whatever perfume is available, musk or whatever, to his head and beard. It does not matter if traces of that perfume remain after he enters \r\n    ihraam, because of the hadeeth narrated in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to enter ihraam, he would perfume himself with the best perfume he could find, then I would see \r\n    shining traces of that musk on his head and beard after that.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 271; Muslim, 1190. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Doing ghusl when entering ihraam is Sunnah \r\n    for both men and women, even women who are bleeding following childbirth or menstruating, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) commanded Asma&rsquo; bint &lsquo;Umays when she was bleeding following childbirth to do ghusl when she entered ihraam, and to bandage her \r\n    private parts and enter ihraam. Narrated by Muslim, 1209. Then after doing ghusl and putting on perfume, the pilgrim should put on the ihraam \r\n    garments and &ndash; apart from women who are bleeding following childbirth or menstruating &ndash; pray the obligatory prayer if that is at the time of an \r\n    obligatory prayer, otherwise they should&nbsp; pray two rak&rsquo;ahs with the intention of the Sunnah prayer of wudoo&rsquo;. When the pilgrim has finished \r\n    praying he should face the qiblah and enter ihraam. He may delay ihraam until he has boarded his means of transportation, and is ready to move \r\n    off, but he should enter ihraam before he leaves the meeqaat for Makkah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should say, <i>Labbayk Allaahumma bi \r\n    &lsquo;Umrah<\/i> (Here I am, O Allaah, for &lsquo;Umrah).<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Then he should recite the Talbiyah as the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did: &ldquo;<i>Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Dubaa&rsquo;ah bint al-Zubayr, when she wanted to enter ihraam but she was sick, to stipulate such a \r\n    condition, and he said, &ldquo;Your condition is valid with your Lord.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5089) and Muslim (1207).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he stipulates this condition and something \r\n    happens to prevent him from completing his pilgrimage, then he can exit his ihraam and does not have to do anything (i.e., offer a sacrifice in \r\n    compensation).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But the one who does not fear that some \r\n    obstacle may prevent him from completing his pilgrimage does not have to stipulate any conditions, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) did not stipulate conditions nor did he command everyone to do so. Rather he told Dubaa&rsquo;ah bint al-Zubayr to do that \r\n    because she was sick.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The muhrim (person who has entered ihraam) \r\n    should recite the Talbiyah a great deal, especially when circumstances and times change, such as when going up to a high place or going down to a \r\n    low place, or when night or day begin. After that he should ask Allaah for His good pleasure and for Paradise, and seek refuge in His Mercy from \r\n    the Fire.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Talbiyah is prescribed in &lsquo;Umrah from the \r\n    moment one enters ihraam until one starts Tawaaf. When he starts Tawaaf he should stop reciting the Talbiyah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ghusl when entering Makkah&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the pilgrim approaches Makkah, he should \r\n    do ghusl before entering, if possible, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl when he entered Makkah. \r\n    Narrated by Muslim, 1259.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;2 &ndash; Tawaaf&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then when he enters al-Masjid al-Haraam he \r\n    should do so with his right foot first, and say, &ldquo;<i>Bismillaah wa&rsquo;l-salaatu wa&rsquo;l-salaam &lsquo;ala Rasool-Allaah.

He should touch the Stone with his right hand and kiss it; if he cannot kiss it then he should touch it with his hand \r\n    and kiss his hand. If he cannot touch it with his hand then he should face the Stone and point to it with his hand and say &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo;, but he \r\n    should not kiss his hand.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is a great deal of virtue in touching \r\n    the Black Stone, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah will raise up the Black Stone on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection and it will have two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak, and it will bear witness for those who \r\n    touched it in sincerity.&rdquo; Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb wa&rsquo;l-Tarheeb<\/i>, 1144.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;It is better not to crowd around and cause \r\n    annoyance to people or be annoyed by them, because of the hadeeth in which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \r\n    &lsquo;Umar: &ldquo;O &lsquo;Umar, you are a strong man, do not crowd around the Stone and disturb the weak.

If he cannot touch it then he should move on, and not crowd around it. \r\n    Between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone he should say, &ldquo;<i>Rabbanaa aatina fi&rsquo;l-dunya hasanah wa fi&rsquo;l-aakhirah hasanah wa qinna &lsquo;adhaab \r\n    al-Naar<\/i> (Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the \r\n    Fire).&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, 1666.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Every time he passes the Black Stone he \r\n    should face it and say &lsquo;Allaahu akbar&rsquo;, and in the rest of his tawaaf he should recite whatever he likes of dhikr, du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and Qur&rsquo;aan, because \r\n    tawaaf around the Ka&rsquo;bah has been established for the remembrance of Allaah.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;In Tawaaf men should do two things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Uncovering the right shoulder (idtibaa&rsquo;) \r\n    from the beginning of tawaaf until the end. This is done by placing the middle of the rida&rsquo; (upper garment) beneath the right armpit and the ends \r\n    of the rida&rsquo; over the left shoulder. When the pilgrim finishes tawaaf, he should put his rida&rsquo; back as it was before tawaaf, because the time for \r\n    wearing it with one shoulder uncovered is only in tawaaf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Raml in the first three circuits only. \r\n    Raml means walking quickly with short steps. In the last four circuits there is no raml, rather the pilgrim should walk normally.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the pilgrim has completed seven circuits \r\n    of tawaaf, he should cover his right shoulder and then go to the Station of Ibraaheem (Maqaam Ibraaheem) and recite the words (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And take you (people) the Maqaam (place) of \r\n    Ibraaheem (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibraaheem (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka&lsquo;bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your \r\n    prayers, e.g. two Rak&lsquo;at after the Tawaaf of the Ka&lsquo;bah at Makkah),&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:125]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should pray two rak&rsquo;ahs behind the \r\n    Station; in the first rak&rsquo;ah after reciting al-Faatihah he should recite <i>Yaa ayyaha&rsquo;l-kaafiroon<\/i> (Soorat al-Kaafiroon 109) and in the second\r\n    <i>Qul Huwa Allaahu ahad<\/i> (Soorat al-Ikhlaas 112). Then when he has finished this prayer he should go to the Black Stone and touch it if he \r\n    can. It is prescribed at this point to touch it only; if he cannot do that then he should go away and not point to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Saa&rsquo;i<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Then he should go out to the Mas&rsquo;aa (place \r\n    for saa&rsquo;i) and when he comes near to al-Safa&rsquo; he should recite (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two \r\n    mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allaah&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:158]<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And he should say: &ldquo;<i>Nabda&rsquo;u bima bada&rsquo;a \r\n    Allaah bihi<\/i> (We start with that with which Allaah started).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he should climb al-Safa until he can see \r\n    the Ka&rsquo;bah, then he should face it and raise his hands and praise Allaah, and make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; as he wishes. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to say: &ldquo;<i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu&rsquo;l-mulk, wa lahu&rsquo;l-hamd, wa huwa &lsquo;ala kulli shay&rsquo;in \r\n    qadeer.

He should recite this dhikr then make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, then recite it again and make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and recite it a third time, then come down \r\n    to al-Marwah, and not make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; after the third time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;When he reaches the green marker he should \r\n    run as quickly as he can without disturbing anyone, because it was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did \r\n    saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and he said, &ldquo;The river bed is not crossed except with vigour.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Maajah and classed as saheeh \r\n    by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Ibn Maajah<\/i>, 2419.&nbsp; The river bed [it was a dried river bed in the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him)] is the area between the two green markers that stand there now.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;When he reaches the second green marker, he \r\n    should walk normally until he reaches al-Marwah. He should climb up it and turn to face the qiblah, and raise his hands and say what he said at \r\n    al-Safa. Then he should come down from al-Marwah and head for al-Safa, walking in the place of walking and running in the place of running. When \r\n    he reaches al-Safa he should do what he did the first time, and the same when he goes back to al-Marwah, until he has completed seven circuits; \r\n    going from al-Safa&rsquo; to al-Marwah is one circuit, and coming back from al-Marwah to al-Safa is another circuit. During his saa&rsquo;i he can say \r\n    whatever he likes or dhikr and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and recite Qur&rsquo;aan.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Note:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;The verse (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Verily, As-Safa \r\n    and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allaah&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:158]<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;should be recited by the pilgrim who wants \r\n    to perform saa&rsquo;i when he approaches al-Safa at the beginning of saa&rsquo;i only.

If he shaves his head he must shave his entire head, and if he cuts his \r\n    hair he must cut from all over his head. Shaving is better than cutting because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair.

Hence the people should not push \r\n    and shove in order to kiss or touch the Black Stone, because that may cause harm that is greater than the reward for doing this action. Similarly \r\n    the Muslim should choose a suitable time for Tawaaf, when it is less crowded and he can do the act of worship in the required manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The scholars have issued fatwas indicating \r\n    that it is permissible to do tawaaf on the upper floors of al-Masjid al-Haraam (the Grand Mosque in Makkah), even though that is difficult, \r\n    because of the greater distance involved &ndash; but it is more conducive to performing the act of worship as it should be done, as the Muslim can avoid \r\n    the pushing and shoving and the bad consequences that may result from that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Sa&rsquo;ee between al-Safa and al-Marwah \r\n    (running between two hills in Makkah called al-Safa and al-Marwah). The same may be said concerning this as was said above concerning Tawaaf, \r\n    although the place is smaller than the place for Tawaaf. The Muslim can also do Sa&rsquo;ee on the upper floor to avoid the crowding on the lower \r\n    floor.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Standing in &lsquo;Arafaah, where all the \r\n    pilgrims gather together at one time in one place, then all they move on at the same time. This is where most people experience difficulties, \r\n    whether it is in the standing or when moving on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; Muzdalifah. The difficulties may stem \r\n    from the absence of services that are available in other places, the most important of which is toilet facilities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence pilgrims are advised to eat and drink \r\n    little in &lsquo;Arafaah and Muzdalifah and on all the days of the Hajj in general, so that they will not need to relieve themselves, then find it \r\n    difficult to find a suitable place, so they will have problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; Stoning the Jamaraat (stone pillars \r\n    representing the devil). This is the most difficult ritual in terms of crowding, and at this time the ignorance of many people becomes manifest \r\n    when they push and shove their brothers and when they stone the Jamaraat from afar with large rocks that cause harm and injury to their Muslim \r\n    brothers; some of them are so ignorant that they throw shoes and pieces of wood!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence we advise the pilgrim to avoid the time \r\n    of peak crowding, which is the forenoon of the first day of Eid, and the time of Zuhr prayer on the other days of al-Tashreeq (the three days \r\n    following Eid), and to stone the Jamaraat at night when the crowding becomes far less, and he can also remember Allaah in a calm manner. The \r\n    scholars have issued fatwas stating that the time for stoning the Jamaraat lasts from after the sun passes the meridian (which is when the time \r\n    for Zuhr prayer begins) until Fajr (dawn), so there is no need to go at the time when the people gather and cause harm to oneself and others and \r\n    not be able to focus properly when doing this act of worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; In Tawaaf al-Wadaa&rsquo; (Farewell Tawaaf), \r\n    when the pilgrims try to leave early to return to their families, so almost all of them gather at the same time, which causes difficulty and harm \r\n    to them, whether that is in going to the sanctuary, when doing Tawaaf itself or when leaving Makkah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence we advise pilgrims to delay this ritual \r\n    until the third of the days of al-Tashreeq and not to be in a hurry. They will earn a greater reward than those who hurry, and they will avoid the \r\n    intense crowding in Tawaaf al-Wadaa&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is a summary of the difficulties that \r\n    the pilgrims encounter. The wisdom of Allaah dictates that the rituals should be performed in that land where there is little vegetation, and \r\n    which is very hot, for great reasons, one of which may be so that Allaah may distinguish His slaves from one another, for no one responds to the \r\n    call of truth except one who is sincere in his intentions towards his Lord.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We should realize that these difficulties do \r\n    not prevent the Muslim from performing this act of worship which Allaah has enjoined in His Book and on the lips of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us that the reward will be commensurate \r\n    with the degree of difficulty; the more difficult it is, the greater the reward will be.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;It was narrated that the Mother of the \r\n    Believers &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;O Messenger of Allaah, the people are going back having done two pilgrimages \r\n    (Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah), and I am going back having done only one (Hajj &ndash; i.e., because her period had come).&rdquo; He said, &lsquo;Wait, and when you become pure \r\n    (i.e., when your period ends), go out to al-Tan&rsquo;eem and enter ihraam from there, then meet us at such and such a place. But it (i.e., the reward) \r\n    is commensurate with the expenses or hardship involved.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1695; Muslim 1211&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The phrase &ldquo;But it (i.e., the reward) is \r\n    commensurate with the expenses or hardship involved&rdquo; indicates that the reward and the virtue of an act of worship increases the more effort and \r\n    spending is required. What is meant by hardship is the type of hardship or spending that is not blameworthy or beyond the acceptable limits set by \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Sharh Muslim<\/i>, \r\n    8\/152, 153&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented on these words \r\n    by saying:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That is undoubtedly correct but this is not \r\n    always the case. Some acts of worship may be easier than others but they may be of a higher status and bring a greater reward because of the \r\n    timing, such as spending the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer in contrast to spending the other nights of Ramadaan in prayer; or because of the \r\n    place where they are done, such as praying two rak&rsquo;ahs in al-Masjid al-Haraam in contrast to praying many rak&rsquo;ahs elsewhere; or financial acts of \r\n    worship (i.e., spending for the sake of Allaah) where some acts are of a higher virtue than others; or physical acts of worship such as fard \r\n    (obligatory) prayers in contrast to naafil (supererogatory) prayers, although the naafil prayer s may be greater in number and more recitation of \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan may be done therein; or a dirhams of zakaah in contrast to spending large amounts in voluntary charity. This was pointed out by al-&lsquo;Izz \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Salaam in <i>al-Qawaa&rsquo;id<\/i>, where he said: Prayer was the delight of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    but it is difficult for others, but the prayer of others, even though it may be difficult, cannot equal his prayer at all.

For people \r\n      differ in their character and attitude.

Being able to do it is a condition of an action being \r\n    obligatory in this case and in others, but this condition of being able to \r\n    do it is emphasized more in the case of Hajj more than in other cases.

But if he commits himself to do something, \r\n    then he must fulfil it, if his vow is a vow to do an act of obedience. The \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever vows to \r\n    do an act of obedience to Allaah, let him obey Him.&rdquo; and Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;They (are those who) fulfil (their) vows, and they fear a \r\n    Day whose evil will be wide&#8209;spreading&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Insaan 76:7]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whatever you spend for spendings (e.g., in Sadaqah &mdash; \r\n    charity for Allaah&rsquo;s Cause) or whatever vow you make, be sure Allaah knows \r\n    it all&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:270]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if a person makes a vow to do an act of obedience, it is \r\n    obligatory for him to fulfil it. The questioner states that she vowed to \r\n    sacrifice a sheep in a specific year and distribute its meat to the poor, \r\n    and this is a vow to do an act of obedience, because sacrificing a sheep is \r\n    an action done to draw close to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and \r\n    giving its meat in charity is a similar act of worship. She specified a \r\n    particular time for that, so she should have fulfilled it at that time. As \r\n    she delayed it and didn't do it at the proper time, she has to make up for \r\n    it later on: she has to sacrifice what she vowed to sacrifice as an act of \r\n    worship to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and give its meat in \r\n    charity, and this will be making up that action. And because of delaying, \r\n    she has to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So she has to do two things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Fulfil the vow that she made, \r\n    making it up (qada&rsquo;)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Offer expiation for breaking a \r\n    vow due to the delay in fulfilling it.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The expiation for breaking the vow is as Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen \r\n    (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your \r\n    own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave.

He said: Allaah has enjoined \r\n    fulfilling vows, and He has forbidden us to fast on the Day of Sacrifice. \r\n    The man repeated (his question), and he gave a similar answer, and no more. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: \r\n    There is consensus that it is not permissible to fast on the day of (Eid) \r\n    al-Fitr or the day of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha), whether it is a voluntary \r\n    fast or in fulfilment of a vow.

If a resident or a traveller or a sick person intends to fast as an \r\n    expiation or in fulfillment of a vow or a voluntary fast or a general fast, \r\n    his intention is not valid and his fast is not valid, and does not count \r\n    either for what he intended or for Ramadaan. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>: The traveller may not fast in \r\n    Ramadaan for something other than Ramadaan, such as a vow or making up a \r\n    fast, because not fasting is permitted to him as a concession to make things \r\n    easier, and if he does not want to avail himself of that concession, then he \r\n    has to do what is originally prescribed. If he intends to observe a fast \r\n    other than Ramadaan, his fast is not valid, either for Ramadaan or for what \r\n    he intended. This is the correct view, and it is the view of most of the \r\n    scholars. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He also said (13\/645):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he vows to Allaah that \r\n    he will fast for one month, and he intends to fast the month of Ramadaan in \r\n    fulfilment of his vow, that is not acceptable. Similarly, if he vows to pray \r\n    two rak&rsquo;ahs, it is not acceptable for him to pray Fajr in fulfilment of his \r\n    vow and for Fajr prayer. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person makes a vow that is connected to \r\n    a condition, he must fulfil the vow when that condition is met and not delay \r\n    it. For example, if he says: &ldquo;If Allaah heals me of this disease I will fast \r\n    for three days for Allaah,&rdquo; and he recovers from that sickness, then he must \r\n    hasten to fast and not delay it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And of them are some \r\n    who made a covenant with Allaah (saying): &lsquo;If He bestowed on us of His \r\n    Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah (Zakaah and voluntary charity in \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous&rsquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>76.&nbsp;Then when He gave \r\n    them of His Bounty, they became niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah \r\n    (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and turned away, averse.<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>77.&nbsp;So He punished them \r\n    by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet \r\n    Him&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Tawbah 9:75-77]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for the vow that is not \r\n    connected to a condition, such as if a person wants to make himself fast for \r\n    three days, for no reason, then he must hasten to fulfil it, but it is not \r\n    like the first case. If Ramadaan comes and he has not fasted, then it is \r\n    well known that he should start with fasting Ramadaan, and when Ramadaan \r\n    ends he can fast in fulfilment of his vow.

As for it not fulfilling his vow, that is because the time of \r\n    Ramadaan is restricted to Ramadaan, and he cannot observe any other fast at \r\n    that time. As for it not counting for Ramadaan, that is because he did not \r\n    form the intention to fast for Ramadaan, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Actions are but by intentions, and \r\n    each man will have but that which he intended.&rdquo; End quote from <i>al-Liqa&rsquo; \r\n    al-Shahri<\/i> (52\/4).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up: The month of \r\n    Ramadaan is allocated specifically for the obligatory fast, and it is not \r\n    permissible to observe any other fast at that time, whether it is a \r\n    voluntary fast or a fast in fulfilment of a vow, whether one is travelling \r\n    or not.

But if a person brings hardship upon himself and \r\n    burdens himself with a heavy duty of fasting or an act of worship that is \r\n    not obligatory according to Islam, then after that he finds it too hard and \r\n    looks for a way out, this is something that he should have avoided in the \r\n    first place, and not made a vow.

So she has no choice but to fast during it. As for \r\n    fasting Rajab and Sha&rsquo;baan, it is obligatory for her to fast during them \r\n    because of her vow only, and she must fast so long as she vowed to fast \r\n    Rajab, Sha&rsquo;baan and Ramadaan, because it was a vow to do an act of worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If she stipulated a specific year, then she must fast Rajab, \r\n    Sha&rsquo;baan and Ramadaan in that specific year.

This comes under the heading of idle oaths. The scholars differed \r\n    as to the precise definition of idle oaths (laghw al-yameen). The most \r\n    correct view is that the idle oath includes the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That which the speaker utters \r\n    unintentionally, such as when a man says, &ldquo;No, by Allaah, I will never go&rdquo; \r\n    or &ldquo;Yes, by Allaah, I will go.&rdquo; This is the view of the Shaafa&rsquo;is and \r\n    Hanbalis.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When a person utters an oath \r\n    thinking that he is speaking the truth, then he realizes that it was not \r\n    true. This is the view of the Hanbalis.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Shaykh al-Islam added to the \r\n    definition of an idle oath cases where the one who swears the oath thinks \r\n    that the one concerning whom it is sworn will not go against him, then he \r\n    does go against him. By the same token a person does not break his oath if \r\n    he swore that another person would do something by way of honouring him, not \r\n    by way of compelling him. He said: Because it is like a command; a command \r\n    is not binding if it is understood to be by way of honouring, because the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Abu Bakr \r\n    to stand in the row but he did not stand. See <i>Majmoo&rsquo;at al-Rasaa&rsquo;il \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> by Shaykh Khaalid al-Mushayqih, p. 234.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, if all or some of your oaths were \r\n    binding, then you have to offer kafaarat yameen, but do you have to offer it \r\n    once or several times? That depends on the content of the oath. If all your \r\n    oaths had to do with the same thing, then you have to offer expiation only \r\n    once. But if you swore oaths concerning a number of things, such as saying, \r\n    &ldquo;By Allaah, I will not eat today&rdquo; and &ldquo;By Allaah, I will not drink today&rdquo; \r\n    and &ldquo;By Allaah, I will not travel today&rdquo;, then you have to offer expiation \r\n    for each of these things if you did it. If you ate and drank and travelled \r\n    then you have to offer three expiations. If you swore one oath concerning a \r\n    number of things, such as if you said, &ldquo;By Allaah, I will not eat or drink \r\n    or travel,&rdquo; then you have to offer expiation once for doing one or all of \r\n    these things. (op. cit., p. 266).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if all or some of your oaths were idle oaths, then the \r\n    majority of scholars have stated that no expiation is required for breaking \r\n    an idle oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Allaah will not call you \r\n    to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Baqarah 2:225]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also questions no.\r\n    [fatin]45676[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]34730[\\fatin].<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7566","question_id":"7566","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Oaths are of three types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; A binding oath.

Please note that \r\n    Allaah has blessed me by helping me to repent from this sin now.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: A Muslim should be determined, resolved and strong \r\n    in resisting haraam things without swearing oaths or making vows, and he \r\n    should do what he is obliged to do without swearing oaths or making vows. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;They swear by Allaah \r\n    their strongest oaths, that if only you would order them, they would leave \r\n    (their homes for fighting in Allaah&rsquo;s Cause).

The scholars (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on them) mentioned that the vow which is intended to help one to \r\n    refrain from something haraam or do something obligatory comes under the \r\n    ruling of a yameen (oath).

He has the choice of doing \r\n    one of these three things. If he cannot do any of them, then he has to fast \r\n    for three consecutive days, because Allaah says in Soorat al-Maa'idah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Allaah will not punish \r\n    you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your \r\n    deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen \r\n    (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your \r\n    own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave.

In this case she is not obliged to observe these fasts, because the \r\n    condition was not fulfilled, as the arguments happened again and divorce \r\n    occurred as a result.

The point of worship is that it should be purely \r\n    for the sake of Allaah. Al-Qaadi &lsquo;Iyaad said: It may be understood that the \r\n    prohibition is because some ignorant people may think that the vow changes \r\n    the divine decree and prevents the divine decree from being carried out, so \r\n    it was forbidden lest some ignorant people believe that.

Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&lsquo;[Maryam said:] I have vowed a fast unto the Most\r\n    Beneficent (Allaah)&hellip;&rsquo; [Maryam 19:26]<\/i>.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So a vow is the action, on the part of a person who is adult and of\r\n    sound mind (mukallaf), of obliging himself to do something that is not obligatory, whether\r\n    he intends to do it straight away or makes his doing it conditional upon something else.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Vows are mentioned in the Qur&rsquo;aan in approving terms. Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Verily, the abraar (pious, who fear Allaah and\r\n    avoid evil), shall drink a cup (of wine) mixed with water from a spring in Paradise called\r\n    Kaafoor, a spring wherefrom the slaves of Allaah will drink, causing it to gush forth\r\n    abundantly. They (are those who) fulfil their vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be\r\n    widespreading.&rdquo; [al-Dahr 76:5-7].<\/i> So Allaah makes their fear of the horrors of\r\n    the Day of Resurrection and their fulfilment of their vows some of the reasons for their\r\n    salvation and admittance to Paradise.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Ruling on vows<\/u>. Fulfilling legitimate (shar&rsquo;i) vows is\r\n    obligatory according to sharee&rsquo;ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Then\r\n    let them complete the prescribed duties (manaasik of Hajj) for them, and perform their\r\n    vows&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Hajj 22:29].<\/i> Imaam al-Shawkaani said: &ldquo;This means that they\r\n    have to do this.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Numerous ahaadeeth have been reported from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) discouraging vows and describing them as makrooh. Abu\r\n    Hurayrah said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said: &lsquo;Do not make vows, for vows do not change qadar (the divine decree) in the\r\n    slightest, but they make the stingy person give something up.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by\r\n    Muslim).<\/p>\r\n    <p>&lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both)\r\n    said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) began\r\n    to discourage us from making vows, and said, &lsquo;They do not change anything, although\r\n    they may make the miser give up something.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari and\r\n    Muslim).<\/p>\r\n    <p>One might ask, how is it that those who fulfil their vows are praised,\r\n    then making vows is discouraged? The answer is that the kind of vow that is praised is the\r\n    vow to do acts of worship that are not connected to anything &ndash; i.e., not conditional\r\n    upon anything &ndash; which makes a man force himself to do acts of worship and prevent\r\n    himself from being lazy, or in thanksgiving for some blessing. The kinds of vow which are\r\n    discouraged are of different types, including vows that are made in return for something,\r\n    whereby a person makes his doing an act of worship conditional upon attaining something or\r\n    warding off something, and if that does not happen, he does not do the act of worship.\r\n    This is what is discouraged, perhaps for the following reasons:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>because then the person who made the vow would be doing the act of\r\n        worship reluctantly, because it has become something he cannot avoid or get out of.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Because when the person making the vow makes the act of worship\r\n        conditional upon his getting what he wants, his vow becomes a kind of exchange or barter\r\n        which corrupts his intention; if the sick person is not cured, he will not give the\r\n        charity which he vowed to give if the sick person was healed. This is miserliness, because\r\n        the miser will not give anything except for something in return in this life (as opposed\r\n        to the Hereafter), and what he gains is more than what he gives.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Some people ignorantly believe that making a vow guarantees that they\r\n        will get whatever they made the vow for, or that Allaah will make it happen for them\r\n        because of the vow.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Another ignorant belief is the idea that making a vow can change\r\n        qadaa&rsquo; (the divine decree), or that it can bring them some immediate benefit or ward\r\n        off some harm. So vows were discouraged lest ignorant people believe such things, and as a\r\n        warning of the danger that such attitudes present to sound belief.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Types of vows and their fulfilment<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>1 - Vows which must be fulfilled (vows to do acts of worship and\r\n    obedience to Allaah)<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <p>This includes every vow which involves a promise to do some kind of act\r\n    of worship, such as praying, fasting, performing &lsquo;Umrah or Hajj, upholding family\r\n    ties, doing I&rsquo;tikaaf (retreat for worship in the mosque), jihaad, enjoining what is\r\n    good and forbidding what is evil. For example, a person may say, &ldquo;It is my duty\r\n    towards Allaah to fast such-and-such (days)&rdquo; or to give such-and-such in charity, or\r\n    to go for Hajj this year, or to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs in al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah]\r\n    in thanksgiving to Allaah for curing a sick person. Or he may make a vow of doing some act\r\n    of worship conditional upon something that will benefit him if it happens, so he says,\r\n    &ldquo;If my absent loved one returns or Allaah protects me from the evil of my enemy, I\r\n    will fast such-and-such (days) or give such-and-such in charity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &ldquo;Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allaah, then let him do it,\r\n    and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6202).<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a man vows to do some act of worship then circumstances change and\r\n    prevent him from fulfilling his vow, such as he vows to fast for a month or to go for Hajj\r\n    or &lsquo;Umrah, then he falls sick and is unable to fast or travel, or he vows to give\r\n    charity, then he becomes poor and is unable to give what he promised, then in such cases\r\n    he must offer expiation (<i>kafaarah<\/i>) for breaking his vow, which is the same as <i>kafaarat\r\n    yameen<\/i> (expiation for breaking an oath). Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with\r\n    them both) said, &ldquo;Whoever makes a vow and is then unable to fulfil it, his expiation\r\n    is <i>kafaarat yameen<\/i>.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in <i>Buloogh\r\n    al-Maraam<\/i>, Its isnaad is saheeh, and some huffaaz thought it was mawqoof.).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>al-Fataawa<\/i> (33\/49):\r\n    &ldquo;If a man intends to vow to do some act of worship and obedience to Allaah, then he\r\n    must fulfil it. If he does not fulfil his vow to Allaah, then he must offer kafaarat\r\n    yameen, according to the majority of the salaf (early generations of Islam).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>2 - Vows which it is forbidden to fulfil, and for which kafaarat\r\n    yameen must be offered<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <p>This includes different types of vows:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Vows to commit sin:<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>This is every vow which involves disobedience to Allaah, such as vows to\r\n      bring oil, candles or money to graves or shrines (mashhads), or to visit tombs and shrines\r\n      of shirk. This is in some ways like making vows to idols. It is also forbidden to fulfil\r\n      vows which promise to do some sin, like committing zinaa (adultery, fornication), drinking\r\n      alcohol, stealing, taking orphans&rsquo; property, denying someone&rsquo;s rights, or\r\n      cutting family ties by cutting a certain relative off or not entering his house for no\r\n      shar&rsquo;i reason. All of these are not permitted at all, and (the person who makes such\r\n      a vow) must offer kafaarat yameen in expiation for his vow. The evidence (daleel) that it\r\n      is not permissible to fulfil this kind of vow is the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may\r\n      Allaah be pleased with her) who reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n      Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to\r\n      Allaah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.&rdquo;\r\n      (Reported by al-Bukhaari). &lsquo;Imraan ibn Husayn reported that the Messenger of Allaah\r\n      <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There should be no fulfilment\r\n      of a vow to commit sin.&rdquo; (Reported by Muslim, 3099).<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>Vows that go against a shar&rsquo;i text (of the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah)<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>If a Muslim makes a vow then it becomes clear to him that this vow of\r\n    his goes against a clear, saheeh text that contains some command or prohibition, then he\r\n    must refrain from fulfilling his vow, and offer kafaarat yameen for it. The evidence for\r\n    this is the report of al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Ziyaad ibn Jubayr,\r\n    who said: &ldquo;I was with Ibn &lsquo;Umar and a man asked him, &lsquo;I made a vow to fast\r\n    every Tuesday or Wednesday as long as I live, and it so happens that this day is Yawm\r\n    al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice, i.e., the first day of Eid al-Adha).&rsquo; He said,\r\n    &lsquo;Allaah has commanded us to fulfil vows and we are forbidden to fast on Yawm\r\n    al-Nahr.&rsquo; He repeated this to him, and said no more and no less.&rdquo; (<i>Saheeh\r\n    al-Bukhaari<\/i>, 6212).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Imaam Ahmad reported that Ziyaad ibn Jubayr said: &ldquo;A man asked Ibn\r\n    &lsquo;Umar, whilst he was walking in Mina, &lsquo;I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or\r\n    Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr, so what do you think?&rsquo; He\r\n    said, &lsquo;Allaah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfil our vows, and the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us [or he\r\n    said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.&rsquo; The man thought that he had not\r\n    heard him properly, so he said, &lsquo;I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and\r\n    it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr.&rsquo; [Ibn &lsquo;Umar] said, &lsquo;Allaah,\r\n    may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfil our vows, and the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to\r\n    fast on Yawm al-Nahr.&rsquo; They kept repeating this exchange until they reached the\r\n    mountain.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: &ldquo;The scholars agree that it is not\r\n    permitted to fast on Yawm al-Fitr and Yawm al-Nahr, neither as an act of worship nor in\r\n    fulfilment of a vow.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Vows concerning which there is no ruling other than kafaarat\r\n    yameen<\/p>\r\n    <p>There are some vows concerning which there is no ruling other than that\r\n    the one who makes such a vow must offer kafaarat yameen in expiation for his vow. These\r\n    include:<\/p>\r\n    <p>- Non-specific vows <\/p>\r\n    <p>If a Muslim makes a vow but does not specify what the vow is about,\r\n    such as saying, &ldquo;I make a vow if Allaah heals this sick person&rdquo; &ndash; but does\r\n    not specify anything, then he must offer kafaarat yameen. &lsquo;Uqbah ibn &lsquo;Aamir\r\n    reported that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    said: &ldquo;The expiation for a vow is kafaarat yameen.&rdquo; (Reported by Muslim). Imaam\r\n    al-Nawawi said: &ldquo;Maalik and many others &ndash; indeed the majority &ndash; interpreted\r\n    this as meaning absolute vows, such as saying &lsquo;I vow&rsquo; [without being\r\n    specific].&rdquo; (<i>Sharh Muslim li&rsquo;l-Nawawi<\/i>, 11\/104).<\/p>\r\n    <p>- Vows concerning things that one does not possess.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person makes a vow concerning something that is not his, then he\r\n    has no option but to offer kafaarat yameen. For example, if he vows to give charity from\r\n    someone else&rsquo;s wealth, or to free someone else&rsquo;s slave, or to give a garden that\r\n    he does not own to someone. The evidence for this ruling is the hadeeth of &lsquo;Amr ibn\r\n    Shu&rsquo;ayb from his father from his grandfather, who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah\r\n    <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;The son of Adam cannot make\r\n    any vow concerning that which is not his, he cannot free (any slave) who is not his, and\r\n    he cannot divorce any wife who is not his.&rdquo; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1101. He said:\r\n    The hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr is a saheeh hasan hadeeth).<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Vows where one has the option of fulfilling the vow or of\r\n    offering kafaarat yameen<\/p>\r\n    <p>There are vows where a person has the option of fulfilling the vow or\r\n    of offering kafaarat yameen. This kind of vow includes:<\/p>\r\n    <p>- Vows made in desperation or in anger:<\/p>\r\n    <p>This means every vow that comes in the form of an oath made to urge for\r\n    something to be done or to stop something from being done, or to swear that something is\r\n    true or not true, where the person does not really intend to make a vow to do some act of\r\n    worship. For example, a man might say in anger, &lsquo;If I ever do such-and-such I have to\r\n    go for Hajj, or fast for a month, or give one thousand dinars in charity&rsquo; or,\r\n    &lsquo;If I ever speak to So-and-so I have to free a slave, or divorce my wife,&rsquo; and\r\n    so on, then he does the thing he said he would not do, but all he really meant by his\r\n    words was that he would not do that thing &ndash; he had no intention of either doing it or\r\n    the thing he vowed to do if he did.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In such a case, this person &ndash; who made the vow for argument&rsquo;s\r\n    sake or to express the urgency of doing or refraining from something &ndash; has the choice\r\n    of either fulfilling the vow, or expiating for it by offering <i>kafaarat yameen<\/i>,\r\n    because his vow was essentially an oath (<i>yameen<\/i>).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Taymiyah said: &ldquo;If a vow is made in the form of an oath, such\r\n    as saying, &lsquo;If I travel with you then I have to go for Hajj, or give all my wealth in\r\n    charity, or free a slave,&rsquo; in the opinion of the Sahaabah and the majority of the\r\n    scholars this is <i>hilf al-nadhr<\/i> (an oath by vowing), it is not a vow. If he does not\r\n    do what he promised to do, it is sufficient for him to offer kafaarat yameen.&rdquo;\r\n    Elsewhere, he said, &ldquo;The obligation of vows made in anger or desperation is one of\r\n    two things, according to the majority: either expiation, or doing the thing promised. If\r\n    he does not fulfil the vow, he must offer expiation (kafaarah).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>- Vows concerning permissible things.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This means every vow that includes permissible things, such as vowing\r\n    to wear a certain type of clothes, eat special foods, ride a certain animal, enter a\r\n    certain house, and so on. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Thaabit ibn al-Dahhaak said: &ldquo;A man vowed to sacrifice a camel in\r\n    Bawaanah (according to one report: because a male child had been born to him). He came to\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &lsquo;I have vowed\r\n    to sacrifice a camel in Bawaanah.&rsquo; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) said: &lsquo;Was there one of the idols of the Jaahiliyyah there that people used\r\n    to worship?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; He asked, &lsquo;Did they used to celebrate\r\n    any of their festivals there?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; The Messenger of Allaah\r\n    <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;Then fulfil your vow, for\r\n    there is no fulfilment of vows that involve disobedience to Allaah, or that concern things\r\n    that the son of Adam does not possess.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2881).<\/p>\r\n    <p>This man had vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawaanah (a place beyond\r\n    Yanboo&rsquo;) in thanksgiving to Allaah, may He be exalted, because He had blessed him\r\n    with a male child. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed\r\n    him to fulfil his vow, so he sacrificed a camel in that place.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We ask Allaah to help us to do that which He loves and will please Him.\r\n    May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"7601","question_id":"7601","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>If the meat was absorbed\r\n      into the food, then he did not break his vow; otherwise, he did break his\r\n      vow.

So what the \r\n    person who swears such an oath intends is to swear an oath by Allaah. \r\n    Similarly, people are used to swearing oaths by these attributes, and there \r\n    is no report to suggest that sharee&rsquo;ah forbids swearing oaths by them.

So \r\n    if a person swears by al-&lsquo;Azeez (the Almighty) or al-&lsquo;Aleem (the \r\n    All-Knowing) or al-Qaadir (the All-Powerful) or al-Samee&rsquo; (the All-Hearing) \r\n    or al-Baseer (the All-Seeing), then it is a permissible oath. There is \r\n    scholarly consensus on this point. The same ruling applies to an oath sworn \r\n    by the attributes of Allaah, such as saying &ldquo;By the glory of Allaah, by His \r\n    knowledge, by His power&rdquo; and so on.

We do not know in \r\n    fact what made you, at such a young age, interpret what you found on your \r\n    body in a bad way that caused you a great deal of anguish, and opened your \r\n    eyes to different kinds of sin, so that you did that evil action a great \r\n    deal. We ask Allah to guide us and you and keep us chaste.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You made another mistake and wronged yourself, your household \r\n    and your husband, when you opened the dark pages of the past and cast a \r\n    shadow over your life with your husband; you told him about something that \r\n    he did not know and did not ask you about, to torment him along with \r\n    yourself with doubt and speculation, and anxiety and suspicion about you and \r\n    your situation. May Allah set your affairs straight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You made a third mistake by swearing a false oath when you \r\n    had no need to do so and we do not think that it benefitted you at all. You \r\n    prayed against yourself that you would not be helped to be successful, when \r\n    you knew that it was a false oath, and now you are saying that you are not \r\n    successful in your life. Your story is very strange, and there was no need \r\n    for all of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now, the first thing that you must do is repent to Allah from \r\n    all that you have done in transgressing the rights of your Lord, the rights \r\n    of your own self and the rights of your husband and household. You have to \r\n    strive, as much as you can, to set straight the things that have been \r\n    spoiled by your bad conduct and failure to understand matters properly. \r\n    Explain to your husband that what happened was no more than mistaken \r\n    thinking and conjecture that was an illusion that turned out to be wrong, \r\n    and you were the one who opened the doors to waswaas and speculation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Strive to let him see that you are a truthful and righteous \r\n    person and try to prove to him through your conduct that you have some \r\n    dignity, so that his mind will be put at rest concerning you and he may be \r\n    happy with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the oath that you swore, saying that you do \r\n    not know this person who did what he did, as you think, this is a false oath \r\n    (al-yameen al-ghamoos). Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said: It is called ghamoos because it immerses (taghmis) the one who does \r\n    that in sin and then in Hell, because the one who knowingly swears a false \r\n    oath concerning a matter that is in the past -- Allah forbid -- has combined \r\n    two things: lying, which is one of the attributes of the hypocrites, and \r\n    taking the matter of swearing an oath by Allah lightly, which is one of the \r\n    attributes of the Jews, because the Jews are the ones who showed disrespect \r\n    to their Lord, and ascribed shortcomings to Him, therefore it is an oath \r\n    that immerses a person in the Fire.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 15\/130&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no expiation for this oath according to the correct \r\n    scholarly view; rather what is required is to repent to Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, and seek His forgiveness. You must also beware of taking the matter \r\n    of oaths lightly if you are telling the truth, so how about if you are \r\n    lying? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I am a student in a Salafi Institute belonging to the \r\n    Jamaa&rsquo;at Ansaar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah in Kasla [?], and there is an \r\n    Eritrean Muslim students union. There are major differences between the \r\n    union and the jamaa&rsquo;ah, hence doing activities with them is not allowed, but \r\n    I participated with them. When the director of the institute found out, he \r\n    asked me: Are you in the union? I said to him, No. He forced me to swear an \r\n    oath so I did, but I was with them. Is this oath yameen ghamoos (a false \r\n    oath) or do I have to offer expiation? Please note that if I had not been \r\n    forced I would not have sworn an oath, but I regarded that as a case of \r\n    necessity, because if I had told the truth he would have banned me from the \r\n    Institute, and it is because of my keenness to seek knowledge that I did \r\n    that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The oath that you mentioned was a yameen ghamoos, which is a \r\n    major sin which cannot be expiated because of its seriousness. No expiation \r\n    is prescribed for it according to the more correct of the two scholarly \r\n    views; rather what is required is repentance and seeking forgiveness, so you \r\n    have to repent and ask for forgiveness for it.

My \r\n    brother got scared and swore that he had not taken out any other passport. \r\n    Please advise us on the ruling concerning this matter and whether he has to \r\n    offer a sacrifice or is some other expiation sufficient?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He has to repent to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \r\n    just as any liar has to repent to Allah, and he has to be sincere in that \r\n    and regret it, and not do it again.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no expiation for a false oath according to the \r\n    correct opinion.

Thus \r\n    Allah will pardon him, because by means of sincere repentance Allah erases \r\n    sin, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And all of you beg \r\n    Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful&rdquo; [al-Noor \r\n    24:31]<\/i>.

[So he could say:] &ldquo;By Allah, \r\n    So and so said such and such about you&hellip; By Allah, such and such a group \r\n    praised you and thanked you and say that you are their friend,&rdquo; in order to \r\n    bring about reconciliation between them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he said, &ldquo;By Allah, I will visit you, or I will help \r\n    you with something if you reconcile, and stop this dispute,&rdquo; then in this \r\n    case he has to fulfil what he promised them, because promises are important \r\n    and one of the characteristics of the believer is that he fulfils his \r\n    promises.

He has to offer expiation if he did break his \r\n    promise, even though he acquired one of the characteristics of the \r\n    hypocrites by breaking his promise. He still has to offer kafaarat yameen \r\n    (expiation for breaking an oath), because he said, &ldquo;By Allah, I will visit \r\n    you on such and such a day,&rdquo; or &ldquo;By Allaah, I will help you,&rdquo; but he did not \r\n    do that, so he has to face the consequences and he may be sinning according \r\n    to those who say that it is obligatory to fulfil oaths based on the apparent \r\n    meaning of the evidence. Or he may not be sinning, but he has acquired one \r\n    of the characteristics of the hypocrites that he should not have acquired.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The apparent meaning of the shar&lsquo;i evidence is that \r\n    fulfilling promises is something obligatory, and that breaking them is \r\n    something haraam and is one of the characteristics of the hypocrites. It is \r\n    not appropriate for one who seeks to bring about reconciliation to break his \r\n    promise, because this will affect future attempts at reconciliation.

But if it is necessary or \r\n    there is an interest to be served by swearing a false oath, there is nothing \r\n    wrong with that, because of the report narrated from the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) in the hadeeth of Umm Kulthoom bint &lsquo;Uqbah \r\n    ibn Abi Mu&lsquo;eet (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;He is not lying \r\n    who reconciles between people, transmitting good words and saying good \r\n    things.&rdquo; She said: And I did not hear him grant any concession allowing any \r\n    of that which people call lying except in three cases: reconciling between \r\n    people, war, and what a man says to his wife or a wife says to her husband. \r\n    Narrated by Muslim in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i>.

This is the view of the majority of scholars. So if he \r\n\thad started the fast then things became easier for him and he could afford \r\n\tto feed poor people after he had started the fast, he does not need to go \r\n\tback to the option of feeding poor persons, so this is even more appropriate \r\n\tin the case of one who fasted and has finished the fasts. Ibn Qudaamah said: \r\n\tIf he has started to fast, then he becomes able to free a slave or feed or \r\n\tclothe poor persons, he does not have to go back to those options. That was \r\n\tnarrated from al-Hasan and Qataadah, and it was the view of Maalik, \r\n\tash-Shaafa&#8216;i, Ishaaq, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir. &#8230; Because it is an \r\n\talternative and it is not invalidated by becoming able to do the action to \r\n\twhich it was an alternative.

The evidence for that is the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab which says that he provided someone with a \r\n    horse to ride in jihad for the sake of Allaah, but the man to whom he gave \r\n    it neglected the horse and did not take care of it. &lsquo;Umar came and asked the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission to \r\n    buy it because he thought that its owner would sell it cheaply, but the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: &ldquo;Do \r\n    not buy it even if he gives it to you for a dirham.&rdquo; The reason for that is \r\n    that it was given for the sake of Allaah, and whatever a person gives for \r\n    the sake of Allaah, it is not permissible for him to take it back. Hence it \r\n    not permissible for the one who has migrated from a land of shirk to go back \r\n    and live there, because he left a land that he loves for the sake of Allaah, \r\n    so it is not permissible&nbsp; for him to go back to something that he loves if \r\n    he gave it up for the sake of Allaah.

He did not offer a sacrifice on behalf of his paternal uncle Hamzah \r\n    even though he was one of his dearest relatives, or on behalf of his children who died during his lifetime, who were three married daughters and \r\n    three sons who died in infancy, or on behalf of his wife Khadeejah who was one of his most beloved wives. And it is not narrated that any of his \r\n    companions offered a sacrifice on behalf of any of their deceased loved ones.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We also think that what some people do, offering a sacrifice on behalf of a deceased loved one in the first year after his or her death, which they call Udhiyat al-Hufrah (the sacrifice of the grave), and they think that no one else can share the reward of it, is wrong &ndash; as is offering a voluntary sacrifice on behalf of their deceased loved ones or in accordance with the will, and not offering a sacrifice on behalf of oneself and one&rsquo;s family, which some people do. If they knew that when a man offers a sacrifice paid for with his own money on behalf of himself and his family, that includes all the members of his family, both living and dead, then they would not do this.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: &nbsp;Risaalat Ahkaam al-Udhiyah wa&rsquo;l-Dhakaah."},{"id":"7660","question_id":"7660","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>One sheep is sufficient as udhiyah for one \r\n    man and his family and whoever he wants among the Muslims, because of the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes should \r\n    be brought to him, so that he could sacrifice it.

The \r\n    purpose behind one is not the same as the purpose behind the other, because \r\n    the udhiyah is a sacrifice offered on behalf of oneself and the &lsquo;aqeeqah is \r\n    a sacrifice offered on behalf of one's child, because by its blessing one \r\n    hopes that the child will be righteous and kind to his parents and may \r\n    intercede for them.

The same applies to fasting Mondays, because \r\n    the purpose is to fill this day with worship by observing this special fast, \r\n    but it may be achieved by observing any other fast on that day.

And because each of them is done for a different reason, so one of them \r\n    cannot be counted as the other, like the sacrifice offered by the pilgrim \r\n    doing tamattu&rsquo; and the sacrifice offered as a fidyah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Haytami said in <i>\r\n    Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj Sharh al-Minhaaj<\/i> (9\/371): The apparent meaning of the \r\n    words of our companions is that if a person intends to offer a sheep as both \r\n    udhiyah and &lsquo;aqeeqah, it fulfils neither purpose.

The difference is that what matters in the first two cases is \r\n    shedding blood (of the sacrificial animal), and one such will not count for \r\n    two. But in the case of the wedding feast the aim is to offer food, which is \r\n    not contrary to shedding blood, so they may be combined.

As for eating from it, it is mustahabb but is not\r\n    waajib (obligatory)&hellip; The majority of scholars interpreted this command (i.e., the\r\n    aayah (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&lsquo;&hellip; eat thereof&hellip;&rsquo; [al-Hajj\r\n    22:28 and 36]<\/i>) as implying encouragement or permission, especially since it came after\r\n    it had been prohibited.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Maalik said: &ldquo;There is no limit to what may be eaten or given in\r\n    charity or used to feed the poor or the rich, whether one wants to give it uncooked or\r\n    cooked.&rdquo; (<i>al-Kaafi<\/i>, 1\/424). The Shaafa&rsquo;is said that it is mustahabb to\r\n    give most of it in charity, and said: &ldquo;At least one third of it may be eaten, and one\r\n    third given in charity, and one third given away as gifts.&rdquo; They said that one half\r\n    may be eaten, but it is more correct to give some of it away in charity.&rdquo; (<i>Nayl\r\n    al-Awtaar<\/i>, 5\/145; <i>al-Siraaj al-Wahhaaj<\/i>, 563). Ahmad said:\r\n    &ldquo;We go along with the hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (ibn &lsquo;Abbaas &ndash; may Allaah\r\n    be pleased with them both): &lsquo;He should eat one third himself, feed one third to\r\n    whomever he wants, and give one third in charity.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Moosa\r\n    al-Isfahaani in <i>al-Wazaa&rsquo;if<\/i>; he said it is a hasan hadeeth. This is also the\r\n    opinion of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and Ibn &lsquo;Umar. No conflicting opinion is known among the\r\n    Sahaabah. <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 8\/632).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason why there is a difference of opinion as to\r\n    how much of the sacrifice may be given in charity is that there are conflicting reports,\r\n    and some reports were narrated without specifying a particular amount, such as the report\r\n    of Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;I had forbidden you to eat from\r\n    the sacrificial meat for more than three days so that those who could afford it could give\r\n    to those who are poor, but now you can eat as you wish, feed others from it, and preserve\r\n    some.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1430; he said it is a saheeh hasan\r\n    hadeeth).

Some Saudi charities\r\nhave been working in this field for several years on the basis of this fatwa,\r\nwhereas the Council is in an embarrassing situation vis-&agrave;-vis the poor Muslims\r\nin other countries because it has stopped offering the <span>udhiyah<\/span>\r\nto them in their countries. Hence we hope that you will do us the <span>honour<\/span> of stating the <span>shar&lsquo;i<\/span>\r\nopinion on this matter.<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>He replied:<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>We have received\r\nyour message with your request for information on the ruling on sending the\r\nvalue of the <span>udhiyah<\/span> to be slaughtered in other\r\ncountries and distributed among poor Muslims, as you read in a fatwa of ours\r\nthat it is permissible for the Council to take the price of the <span>udhiyahs<\/span> from its supporters and use it to buy the animals\r\nto be slaughtered at the time of sacrifice and distributed to the Muslims in a\r\ncountry that is poorer and in greater need. We said that on the basis that the\r\nwisdom behind offering a sacrifice is to revive the <span>Sunnah<\/span>\r\nand bring some relief to Muslims on the days of <span>Eid<\/span>\r\nwhich are days of joy and happiness, because in this country there are people\r\nwho are wealthy and want to do good, and they had left instructions to\r\nslaughter <span>udhiyah<\/span> so that in one household a great\r\nnumber of <span>udhiyahs<\/span> are being offered, but there are\r\nfew poor people who need to eat it during those days. So we thought that it was\r\nmore appropriate to send the money to a poor country with which to buy the\r\nanimals and slaughter them during the days of <span>Eid<\/span> in\r\nthe name of the donors, and divide them among the poor Muslims of <span>Ahl<\/span> as-<span>Sunnah<\/span> <span>wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah<\/span>.\r\nThis is better than leaving the meat frozen to be eaten over a number of\r\nmonths. However, if there are poor people in one&rsquo;s own country, then it is\r\nbetter to give it to them so as to meet their needs. This is what we think, but\r\nyou may ask others for <span>fatwas<\/span>.

One of the important issues in this regard is the\r\npermissibility of transferring the <span>udhiyah<\/span> from the\r\nland of the one who is offering the sacrifice to another land, especially as\r\nthere is nothing in the Book of Allah or the <span>Sunnah<\/span>\r\nof His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to suggest that\r\nthis is not allowed. The basic principle in that regard is that it is\r\npermissible. If it is permissible in the case of <span>zakaah<\/span>,\r\nwhich is obligatory according to consensus, to transfer it from one land to\r\nanother land to serve a greater interest and meet a greater need, then how\r\nabout the <span>udhiyah<\/span>, which is <span>mustahabb<\/span>?<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>Some scholars\r\ndisallowed it, on the grounds that it means missing out on <span>practising<\/span>\r\nthis ritual, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><i><span>&ldquo;And the <span>Budn<\/span> (cows, oxen, or camels driven to be offered as\r\nsacrifices by the pilgrims at the sanctuary of <span>Makkah<\/span>.)\r\nWe have made for you as among the Symbols of Allah, therein you have much good.\r\nSo mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for\r\nsacrifice).

Holding a feast \r\n    (waleemah) when a person dies and inviting neighbours, relatives and others \r\n    to it for the purpose of mourning is an innovation and is not permissible. \r\n    The same applies to doing these things every week or at the new year, All of \r\n    these are innovations of Jaahiliyyah. Rather what is prescribed for the \r\n    family of the deceased is to be patient and seek reward with Allaah, and to \r\n    say what the patient say: <i>Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji&rsquo;oon<\/i> \r\n    (verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return). Allaah has promised \r\n    them much good, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;They are \r\n    those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) \r\n    from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they \r\n    who are the guided ones&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:157]<\/i>. There is nothing wrong with \r\n    them making regular food for themselves as needed, and if they have guests \r\n    there is nothing wrong with them making food for them as appropriate, \r\n    because of the general meaning of the evidence concerning that. It is \r\n    prescribed for their relatives and neighbours to make food for them and send \r\n    it to them, because it is proven that when news of the death of Ja&rsquo;far ibn \r\n    Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) came to the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when Ja&rsquo;far was killed in \r\n    the battle of Mu&rsquo;tah in Syria, he said to his family: &ldquo;Make food for the \r\n    family of Ja&rsquo;far, for there has come to them that which is preoccupying \r\n    them.&rdquo; This indicates that it is prescribed for relatives and others to send \r\n    food to the family of the deceased at the time of the calamity.

A man should not be buried with a woman except in cases of \r\n    extreme necessity, and a barrier of earth should be placed between them in \r\n    that case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is indicated by the \r\n    report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1343) from Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) wrapped two men of those slain at Uhud in a single \r\n    cloth, then he said: &ldquo;Which of them had more knowledge of Qur'aan?&rdquo; When one \r\n    of them was pointed out to him, he put him in the lahd (niche) first, and he \r\n    said: &ldquo;I will be a witness for them on the Day of Resurrection.&rdquo; And he \r\n    ordered that they be buried with their blood (wounds) and that they not be \r\n    washed or the funeral prayer be offered for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated by \r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i (2010), al-Tirmidhi (1713) and Abu Dawood (3215) that Hishaam ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Aamir said: We complained to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of Uhud and said: O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, it is too hard for us to dig a grave for every man. The Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Dig graves \r\n    and make them deep, and dig them well, and put two or three men in each \r\n    grave.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They said: Who should we \r\n    put first, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: &ldquo;Put the one who knew more \r\n    Qur'aan first.&rdquo; He (the narrator) said: My father was the third of three in \r\n    a single grave.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This hadeeth was classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (5\/247): It is not permissible to \r\n    bury two men or two women in a single grave except in cases of necessity. \r\n    Similarly, al-Sarkhasi stated that it is not permissible. The view of the \r\n    majority is that two people should not be buried in one grave, as it says in\r\n    <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>. A number of scholars stated that it is mustahabb not to \r\n    bury two people in one grave, but if there is a case of necessity such as a \r\n    large number of people who have been killed or who died in an epidemic or as \r\n    the result of a building collapse or drowning, etc, and it is too hard to \r\n    bury each one in a separate grave, then it is permissible to bury two or \r\n    three or more in one grave, as dictated by necessity, because of the hadeeth \r\n    quoted above. Our companions said: In that case the best of them should be \r\n    placed closest to the qiblah, and if a man, woman and child are buried \r\n    together, the man should be placed closest to the qiblah, then the child, \r\n    then the hermaphrodite, then the woman. Our companions said: The father \r\n    should be placed before the son, even if the son was better, out of respect \r\n    to the father, and the mother should be placed before the daughter. It is \r\n    not permissible to put a man and a woman in the same grave unless there is \r\n    definitely a case of necessity, and in that case a barrier of dirt should be \r\n    put to separate them, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on \r\n    this point. The man should be put closest to the qiblah even if he is her \r\n    son. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some scholars are of the \r\n    view that more than one person may be buried in a single grave, and that it \r\n    is only makrooh. This is the view of the Maalikis and was mentioned in one \r\n    report from Ahmad. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). See <i>al-Insaaf<\/i> (2\/551); <i>\r\n    Sharh al-Kharashi<\/i> (2\/134).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Others were of the view \r\n    that it is not makrooh, but they said that it should be rejected in favour \r\n    of that which is better. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: The correct view in my opinion &ndash; and Allaah \r\n    knows best &ndash; is the middle view, which is that it is makrooh, as stated by \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. Otherwise, if the first person has been buried \r\n    and is settled in his grave, then he has more right to it, and in that case \r\n    a second person should not be introduced to the grave, except in cases of \r\n    extreme necessity.

It was narrated that \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade \r\n    eulogies. Narrated by Imam Ahmad (18659) and Ibn Maajah (1592).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The narrator of this hadeeth is Ibraaheem al-Hijri who \r\n    narrated it from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah. Al-Busayri said on him in <i>Misbaah \r\n    al-Zajaajah<\/i>: He is da&rsquo;eef jiddan (very weak). He was classed as da&rsquo;eef \r\n    by Sufyaan ibn &lsquo;Uyaynah, Yahya ibn Ma&rsquo;een, al-Nasaa&rsquo;i and others. \r\n    Al-Bukhaari said of him: he is munkar al-hadeeth, i.e., his hadeeth is to be \r\n    rejected. Hence al-Albaani classed him as da&rsquo;eef in <i>Da&rsquo;eef Ibn Maajah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (22\/98):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Durr al-Mukhtaar<\/i>, which is a Hanafi \r\n    book, that there is nothing wrong with eulogizing the deceased in verse or \r\n    otherwise, but it is makrooh to go to extremes in praising him, especially \r\n    at his funeral. Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, quoting from the author \r\n    of <i>al-Tatimmah<\/i> that it is makrooh to eulogize the deceased by \r\n    mentioning his forefathers, his attributes and his deeds, and it is better \r\n    to pray for forgiveness for him. The Hanbalis said that that which stirs up \r\n    the feelings of loss, whether it comes in the form of exhortation or \r\n    reciting poetry is a form of niyaahah (wailing for the deceased), i.e. it is \r\n    forbidden. This was stated by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Furooq<\/i> (2\/174), al-Qaraafi divided eulogizing \r\n    into four categories, and said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not just the matter of allowing eulogies and not \r\n    regarding as faasiqs (evildoers) the poets who eulogize deceased kings and \r\n    prominent figures in all cases, even though that view is well known among \r\n    the people. In fact eulogizing falls into four categories, haraam and a \r\n    major sin, haraam and a minor sin, permissible, and recommended.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The guideline on that which is haraam and a major sin is any \r\n    words which make people feel that Allaah, may He be exalted, has been unfair \r\n    in His decree or that expresses discontent with His will, and suggests that \r\n    the death of this deceased was not a good thing, rather it was a great evil. \r\n    Making the listeners believe that is haraam and a major sin, whether it is \r\n    done in prose or poetry, such as if the poet says in his eulogy:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;There has died one among whose troops was death, one before \r\n    whom the divine decree felt scared&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This line of verse includes a rejection of the divine decree \r\n    in the words &ldquo;one among whose troops was death&rdquo;, which is a veneration of \r\n    this person who has died. One such as this deceased person should not have \r\n    resigned from the position of caliph; how could there ever be such a person \r\n    again in the future? Similarly, the words &ldquo;one before whom the divine decree \r\n    felt scared&rdquo; suggest that Allaah, may He be exalted, was afraid of him. If \r\n    this is not blatant kufr then it seems from these words to be very close to \r\n    it. Hence when Shaykh &lsquo;Izz al-Deen ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Salaam was in the gathering \r\n    in which the sultaan assembled the prominent, Qur&rsquo;aan readers and poets to \r\n    mourn the caliph in Baghdad, and one of the poets recited the line,&nbsp; &ldquo;There \r\n    has died one among whose troops was death, one before whom the divine decree \r\n    felt scared&rdquo;, when the Shaykh heard that, he ordered that he be disciplined \r\n    and imprisoned, and he denounced that in the strongest terms and criticized \r\n    his eulogy. After his ta&rsquo;zeer punishment he remained in prison for a long \r\n    time, then he asked him to repent after the governors and leaders interceded \r\n    for him. He told him to compose a qaseedah praising Allaah, as expiation for \r\n    what his poem had said about condemning the divine decree and suggesting \r\n    that Allaah, may He be exalted, was afraid of the deceased. The poets often \r\n    tried to indulge in such critical issues so as to attract attention by \r\n    coming up with unique ideas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This type is the worst type of eulogy. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The guideline on that which is haraam and a minor sin is any \r\n    prose or poetry that does not go as far as the type mentioned in the first \r\n    category, but it deprives the family of the deceased of consolation and \r\n    stirs up their grief to such an extent that they torment themselves and have \r\n    little patience, and it may lead them to despair, rending their garments and \r\n    striking their cheeks. This is haraam and is a minor sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The guideline on that kind of eulogy which is permissible is \r\n    words that do not include any of the things mentioned in the two previous \r\n    categories, rather it mentions the religious commitment of the deceased, and \r\n    states that he has gone on to the reward for his good deeds and will be in \r\n    the company of the people who are blessed; that there has come to him that \r\n    which is decreed for all people; this is inevitable and it is something that \r\n    all creatures have in common, a door which they will inevitably enter. This \r\n    is permissible and is not forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The guideline on the kind of eulogy that is recommended is \r\n    everything that falls into the permissible category and will increase the \r\n    family of the deceased in patience and encourage them to seek reward, and \r\n    remind them to seek reward for their loss for the sake of Allaah and rely on \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s care, etc. This is recommended and enjoined. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of this is what was narrated from al-&lsquo;Abbaas ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-Muttalib (may Allaah be pleased with him), when he died and his son \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah found it too difficult to bear. A Bedouin came from the desert \r\n    and asked after &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas. When he entered upon him he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Be patient, we are being patient for your sake, for the \r\n    people will be patient when their leader is patient.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reward that comes after is better than al-&lsquo;Abbaas and \r\n    Allaah is better for al-&lsquo;Abbaas than you.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn al-&lsquo;Abbaas heard this eulogy and \r\n    understood his poetry, he felt relieved.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These words were the best kind of eulogy, that lessened the \r\n    impact of the calamity, took away grief, and expressed a positive attitude \r\n    towards the divine decree, praising the Lord in the best of ways. This is a \r\n    good thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the four categories described above, we may \r\n    categorize eulogies accordingly. And Allaah knows best. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade eulogizing as was narrated by Ahmad \r\n    and Ibn Maajah, and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, if he forbade it than \r\n    how could he have done it? i.e., in the hadeeth of Sa&rsquo;d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) quoted above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that the kind of eulogizing that is forbidden \r\n    is that which praises the deceased and mentions his good qualities, so as to \r\n    stir up grief and renew the sorrow, or which is done in gatherings convened \r\n    for that purpose, or when the eulogy is limited to that without mentioning \r\n    anything else. What is meant in this hadeeth is the Prophet&rsquo;s expression of \r\n    sorrow for Sa&rsquo;d because he died in Makkah after having migrated from it, not \r\n    praising the deceased and stirring up grief.

Rather, \r\n    gathering to offer condolences is makrooh as has been stated by many of the \r\n    scholars. Some of them have even stated that it is bid&rsquo;ah. Hence we \r\n    encourage our Muslim brothers not to do that, i.e., not to sit and receive \r\n    people&rsquo;s condolences.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly &ndash; because that was not the way of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or of the Sahaabah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly &ndash; because it is as if this person who is sitting at \r\n    home and expecting people to come to him, is saying, &lsquo;O people, I have been \r\n    stricken with a calamity so come and console me,&rsquo; and this is something that \r\n    is not befitting for a wise man. Rather the one who has been stricken with a \r\n    calamity should be patient and bear it without telling people, either \r\n    implicitly or explicitly, come and console me.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly &ndash; Some people may go to extremes with regard to these \r\n    gatherings, so that they become like wedding parties. You pass some through \r\n    some neighbourhoods and see a house lit up with electric lights with the \r\n    doors open, and chairs and canopies set out, and people coming and going, as \r\n    if they are at a wedding party.&nbsp; Undoubtedly this is not Sunnah, rather it \r\n    is definitely contrary to the Sunnah, and it makes people try to console \r\n    themselves with these activities and not by hoping for reward or bearing it \r\n    with patience, because this is no more than physical activities. Rather the \r\n    house should remain as it was and the people should remain as they were, and \r\n    they should bear it with patience amongst themselves and encourage one \r\n    another to be patient. This is the Sunnah. Hence when news of the death of \r\n    Ja&rsquo;far ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) came, the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Make food for the \r\n    family of Ja&rsquo;far, for there has come to them something that is distracting \r\n    them.&rdquo; He did not say: go to them, gather with them and eat with them, \r\n    rather he said: &ldquo;Make food for the family of Ja&rsquo;far, for there has come to \r\n    them something that is distracting them,&rdquo; i.e., from making food. Because no \r\n    matter how much faith people have, they will still be upset, especially if \r\n    the calamity is great. But if the people gather and food is offered and send \r\n    to them, or they make it themselves, in this case the Sahaabah regarded \r\n    making food and people gathering to eat it as a kind of niyaahah (wailing \r\n    for the deceased).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we say to our brothers: Be kind to yourselves and do \r\n    not burden yourselves with these actions which will only increase you in \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah which was not known at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), or at the time of his companions.

Ibn &lsquo;Aabideen \r\n    said: The same applies to burial in a private plot as is done by those who \r\n    build schools and so on, and have a burial place built close to it.

With regard to the one who \r\n    cannot be found, the funeral prayer must be offered for them in absentia, \r\n    because offering the funeral prayer is a communal obligation (<i>fard \r\n    kafaayah<\/i>) which must be fulfilled.

Camphor is a type of perfume.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz said in <i>al-Fath<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is said that the \r\n    reason why camphor is used, although it is a perfume, is because of the \r\n    angels and others who attend, in addition to the fact that it has a drying \r\n    and cooling effect; it can penetrate the body of the deceased and stiffen \r\n    the body, keep vermin away, prevent wastes from being expelled, and prevent \r\n    the body from decomposing rapidly. It is the most effective of perfumes in \r\n    that sense. This is the reason why it is put in the last wash, because if it \r\n    was put in the first wash the water would remove it. But can musk, for \r\n    example, be used instead of camphor? If we think just in terms of fragrance, \r\n    then yes, otherwise the answer is no.

It was narrated that Abu \r\n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Exhort your dying ones to \r\n    say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, for if a person&rsquo;s last words are Laa ilaaha \r\n    ill-Allaah at the time of death, he will enter Paradise at some point, no \r\n    matter what befalls him before that.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan; classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 5150.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Another indication that \r\n    the command to exhort the dying to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah includes \r\n    kaafirs too is what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) did with his paternal uncle Abu Taalib, and with the Jewish boy who \r\n    used to serve him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    was present when his uncle Abu Taalib was dying, and he said to him: &ldquo;O \r\n    uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, a word for which I will testify for you \r\n    before Allaah.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3884; Muslim, 24.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    was also present when the Jewish boy who used to serve him was dying. He \r\n    said to him: &ldquo;Become Muslim&rdquo; &ndash; according to the report narrated by Ahmad \r\n    (12381): &ldquo;Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1356.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Two notes from Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Should this exhortation come in the form of a command, \r\n    whereby one says to the dying person: &ldquo;Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah&rdquo; or should \r\n    it be done by repeating the words in his presence so that he will remember \r\n    them when he hears someone saying them by his side?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That depends on the condition of the sick person. If he is of \r\n    strong faith and can accept the command, or if he is a kaafir, he should be \r\n    commanded to say it, by saying: &ldquo;Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let your life \r\n    end with Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he is a Muslim and is of weak faith, he should not be \r\n    commanded, rather Allaah should be mentioned in his presence so that he will \r\n    hear and remember. This differentiation is based on the reports and on \r\n    rational thinking. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the reports, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) commanded his uncle Abu Taalib, when he was dying, to \r\n    say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. He said: &ldquo;O uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for rational thinking: If he says it, all well and good, \r\n    and if he does not say it, he is a kaafir anyway. If we assume that if he \r\n    did not like this command and did not say it, then he remains as he is and \r\n    nothing has changed. If he is a Muslim and can bear it if we tell him to say \r\n    it, it will not affect him, but if he is weak (in faith) and we tell him to \r\n    say it, perhaps he will react by becoming upset and angry, and he will \r\n    reject it as he is departing this world. There are some people who, if they \r\n    are told to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah when they are in a state of good \r\n    health, they will say: &ldquo;I will never say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah.&rdquo; At times of \r\n    anger, some people get so confused that they say, &ldquo;I do not to say Laa \r\n    ilaaha ill-Allaah.&rdquo; So what do you think about this situation?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We are to exhort the dying person to say Laa ilaaha \r\n    ill-Allaah and not &ldquo;Muhammad rasool-Allaah&rdquo; because this is what is narrated \r\n    in the hadeeth: &ldquo;Exhort your dying ones to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah.&rdquo; The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If a \r\n    person&rsquo;s last words in this world are Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, he will enter \r\n    Paradise.&rdquo; The word of Tawheed is the key to Islam, and whatever comes after \r\n    that is additional.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person combines both phrases of the Shahaadah and says \r\n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah Muhammad rasool Allaah, this does not mean that his \r\n    last words in this world are not Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, because the \r\n    testimony that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    is the Messenger of Allaah is a part of that affirmation. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) regarded these words, along with the testimony that Allaah is God, as a \r\n    single principle, and there is no need to exhort the person repeatedly. The \r\n    apparent meaning of the evidence is that it is not sufficient for the dying \r\n    person to say Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool-Allaah, rather he must say: Laa \r\n    ilaaha ill-Allaah. End quote from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 5\/177&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The evidence that the Muslim should be commanded to say it if he is strong in faith is derived from the hadeeth about the Ansaari that is quoted above, in which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded him to \r\n    say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah: &ldquo;O maternal uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, the doctor said to &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab, after he gave him milk to drink and the milk came out of his wound solid and white: &ldquo;O Ameer al-Mu&rsquo;mineen, recommend someone to succeed you.&rdquo; &lsquo;Umar said: &ldquo;You are being truthful with me.

Imam Muslim mentioned in his introduction to his <i>\r\n    Saheeh<\/i> that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak regarded this hadeeth as weak, \r\n    then he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity \r\n    (i.e., on behalf of the dead).

But whoever wants to honour his parents, let him \r\n    give charity on their behalf, for (the reward of) charity will reach the \r\n    deceased and benefit them, and there is no difference of opinion among the \r\n    Muslims concerning this point. This is the correct view. With regard to the \r\n    report narrated by the qaadi Abu&rsquo;l-Hasan al-Maawardi al-Basri al-Faqeeh \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i in his book <i>al-Haawi<\/i> from some of the scholars of \r\n    al-kalaam, that no reward can reach the deceased after his death, this is a \r\n    view that is definitely wrong and is clearly contrary to the texts of the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah, so no attention should be \r\n    paid to it. With regard to praying and fasting on behalf of the dead, the \r\n    view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and the majority of the scholars is that the reward for \r\n    that does not reach the deceased, unless it is a fast that was obligatory \r\n    for the deceased, so his heir or someone to whom the heir gives permission \r\n    makes it up on his behalf. Two views concerning this were narrated from \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, the better known of which is that it is not valid; the more \r\n    correct view according to the later Shaafa&rsquo;i scholars is that it is valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to reading Qur&rsquo;aan, the well-known view of the \r\n    Shaafa&rsquo;i madhhab is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased. \r\n    Some of his companions said that its reward does reach the deceased. Some of \r\n    the scholars were of the view that the reward of all acts of worship &ndash; \r\n    prayer, fasting, reading Qur&rsquo;aan, etc &ndash; reaches the deceased&hellip; Then al-Nawawi \r\n    mentioned that the reward for du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, charity and Hajj reaches the deceased, \r\n    according to scholarly consensus.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj<\/i> (7\/72):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The deceased can benefit from charity given on his behalf, \r\n    which includes a waqf of a Mus-haf etc, or digging a well, or planting a \r\n    tree, whether he does that during his lifetime or it is done by someone else \r\n    on his behalf after his death.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the best ways of benefiting your father, you \r\n    should make a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for him.

There are two views:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That any righteous deed may be given to the dead and that \r\n    (the reward) reaches them &ndash; such as reading Qur&rsquo;aan, fasting, praying and \r\n    other acts of worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That no righteous deed reaches the dead except those for \r\n    which there is evidence that it reaches them.

No such thing has been narrated from any of the \r\n    Sahaabah either. If it were prescribed, then they would have done it before \r\n    us.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The exceptions for which there is evidence that the reward \r\n    does reach the deceased are: Hajj, &lsquo;Umrah, obligatory fasts, charity and \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo; \r\n    &lsquo;<i>And that man can have nothing but what he does<\/i>&rsquo;:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From this verse al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and those who followed him \r\n    understood that the reward for reading Qur&rsquo;aan does not reach the deceased, \r\n    because it is not something that they did or earned. Hence the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not recommend or \r\n    encourage his ummah to do that, and he did not tell them to do that through \r\n    any statement or gesture. Nor is it narrated that any of the Sahaabah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with them) did that. If it were good they would have done \r\n    that before us. So the acts of worship are restricted to those mentioned in \r\n    the texts, and there is no room for analogy or personal opinions. With \r\n    regard to du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and charity, there is scholarly consensus that the reward \r\n    for them reaches the deceased and that they are mentioned in sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tafseer Ibn Katheer<\/i>, 4\/258.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If we assume that the \r\n    reward for all righteous deeds reaches the deceased, then the best thing \r\n    that can benefit the deceased is du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;.

All goodness is to be found in the guidance of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked \r\n    about giving the reward for reading Qur&rsquo;aan and charity to one's mother, \r\n    whether she is alive or dead.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to reading Qur&rsquo;aan, the scholars differed as to \r\n    whether the reward for that will reach the deceased. There are two scholarly \r\n    views, <u>the more correct of which is that it does not reach the deceased \r\n    because there is no evidence to that effect<\/u>. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do that for his deceased Muslim \r\n    loved ones such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, and the \r\n    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not do that or approve of it, \r\n    as far as we know<u>. It is better for the believer not to do that and not \r\n    to read Qur&rsquo;aan for the dead or the living, or to pray on their behalf<\/u>, \r\n    or to observe voluntary fasts on their behalf, because there is no evidence \r\n    for any of that. The basic principle concerning acts of worship is that we \r\n    do not do anything except that which is proven to be prescribed by Allaah or \r\n    His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Charity benefits both the living and the dead, according to \r\n    Muslim consensus. Similarly du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; benefits both the living and the dead \r\n    according to Muslim consensus. Undoubtedly the living benefit from charity \r\n    given by them and by others, and they benefit from du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. If a person makes \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for his parents when they are alive, they benefit from his du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, as \r\n    they also benefit from charity given on their behalf when they are still \r\n    alive, and from Hajj done on their behalf if they are unable to do it \r\n    themselves because of old age or incurable sickness. So a person may benefit \r\n    them by doing that. Hence it is narrated that a woman said to the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, \r\n    Allaah&rsquo;s command to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and \r\n    cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf?&rdquo; He \r\n    said: &ldquo;Perform Hajj on his behalf.&rdquo; Another man came to him and said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, my father is an old man and cannot perform Hajj or \r\n    travel; shall I perform Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah on his behalf?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Perform \r\n    Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah on behalf of your father.&rdquo; This indicates that it is \r\n    permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of one who has died or on behalf of a \r\n    living man or woman who is unable to do it because of old age. So giving \r\n    charity, making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and performing Hajj on behalf of one who has died or \r\n    one who is unable to do it will benefit him, according to all the scholars. \r\n    Similarly one may fast on behalf of a deceased person, if he owed an \r\n    obligatory fast &ndash; whether as the result of a vow, as an expiation or to make \r\n    up for a Ramadaan fast &ndash; because of the general meaning of the words of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Whoever dies \r\n    owing a fast, his heir must observe the fast on his behalf.&rdquo; Saheeh &ndash; agreed \r\n    upon. And there are other ahaadeeth which say the same thing. But whoever \r\n    delays Ramadaan fasts for a legitimate reason, such as sickness or travel, \r\n    then dies before he is able to make them up, there is no need to fast them \r\n    on his behalf or feed the poor, because he is excused.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    4\/348.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for a man to \r\n    give money in charity and to share the reward for it with someone else? He \r\n    replied: It is permissible for a person to give money in charity and intend \r\n    for it to be on behalf of his father, his mother or his brother or anyone \r\n    else he wants among the Muslims, because the reward is great.

Its conquest, beyond a doubt, \r\n    was one of the greatest incidents of the first Hijri century (92 AH\/711 CE). \r\n    That period was the greatest and most prosperous in the history of Andalusia \r\n    from the beginning of history and perhaps until the end of time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because of the importance of this topic, it is essential to \r\n    explain a number of important matters that have to do with this great \r\n    event.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most important aim for which jihad has been prescribed is \r\n    to convey the message of Tawheed by eliminating all suppressive powers which \r\n    come between the people and Tawheed, and calling people to Islam without \r\n    compulsion or force, rather they should come to it willingly and by choice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief \r\n    and worshipping of others along with Allaah) and (all and every kind of) \r\n    worship is for Allaah (Alone).

At the dawn of the fifth century CE, in around \r\n    410 CE, it was overrun by the Gothic tribes (Visigoths) whose religion was \r\n    Arianism, during which they established a Gothic state, the capital of which \r\n    was Toledo.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we can understand that the original peoples of \r\n    Andalusia &ndash; Catholic Canaanites &ndash; were, before the Islamic conquest, subject \r\n    to Gothic rule. The inhabitants formed four classes which were in conflict \r\n    with one another: the ruling, colonialist class of Goths; the Roman elite, \r\n    which also included feudal lords and clergymen; the Jews; and a working \r\n    class composed of indigenous inhabitants of the land.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was a land under occupation and persecution, which was not \r\n    under the rule of its indigenous inhabitants. It was not the Muslims who \r\n    initiated the idea of conquering it, rather they rid the land of an unjust \r\n    occupation and it turned into a Muslim land whose inhabitants chose to \r\n    follow Islam and become part of this Islamic state.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In addition to the occupation that the Visigoth tribes \r\n    imposed on Andalusia, domination, oppression and persecution were prominent \r\n    features of their period of rule which lasted for approximately three \r\n    centuries.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Husayn Mu&rsquo;nis says in his book <i>Fajr al-Andalus <\/i>(p. 8, \r\n    18-19):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But their authority was not well established in the land at \r\n    first, because of the religious conflicts that occurred between them and the \r\n    original people, and because of the disputes that occurred among their \r\n    rulers. Hence throughout the sixth century the land was subjected to civil \r\n    wars and the chaos and problems that resulted from them, until the time of \r\n    the last Visigoth ruler, whose name was Roderic (in Arabic, Ludhreeq). What \r\n    is clear and indisputable is that the man felt that he was not fully in \r\n    control and all his life he feared an attack from his many enemies. These \r\n    enemies were not only the sons of Wittiza, whose kingdom Roderic had \r\n    usurped, rather they included most of the Iberian, Roman and Jewish people, \r\n    i.e., most of the people of the land which the Goths had invaded. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Many Spanish historians have tried to defend the Gothic state \r\n    &ndash; out of resentment and rejection of the Islamic presence in that land &ndash; but \r\n    the history books are filled with evidence of what Professor Husayn Mu&rsquo;nis \r\n    mentioned of the local people&rsquo;s rejection of Gothic rule. On p. 10 he quotes \r\n    Rafael Balasteros, the Spanish historian, as saying &ldquo;If the Arabs had not \r\n    interfered in the Peninsula&rsquo;s affairs in 711 CE and put an end to this age \r\n    of turmoil, the Goths would have inflicted unimaginable harm on Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When the Goths&rsquo; oppression of that land intensified and its \r\n    people could not longer put up with it, they sent word to the Muslims, \r\n    asking them to help them and save them. The Arabic sources are agreed that \r\n    the ruler of Ceutah, whose name was Julian, sent word to Moosa ibn Nusayr, \r\n    asking him to enter the land and rid it of the evil of Roderic. Many sources \r\n    also state that the sons of Wittiza sent word to Moosa ibn Nusayr asking him \r\n    for help against the one who had usurped their father&rsquo;s kingdom. Even \r\n    Western historical sources state that the Jews in Andalusia who were being \r\n    persecuted by the Goths sought help from those who were across the sea in \r\n    Africa, or the Muslims, to save them from the oppression of Roderic and his \r\n    helpers. Although this is denied by some historians, they are all agreed \r\n    that the Jews, during that period, were subject to persecution that almost \r\n    destroyed them and would have left no trace of them. See <i>Fajr al-Andalus<\/i> \r\n    by Husayn Mu&rsquo;nis (p. 14).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the surviving texts there is a great deal of evidence to \r\n    suggest that the Andalusians welcomed the Muslims as saviours. For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The author of the book <i>Akhbaar Majmoo&rsquo;ah fi Fath \r\n    al-Andalus<\/i> (p. 24) says, describing the services that some of the \r\n    Spaniards offered to Moosa ibn Nusayr:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When he reached the Peninsula, it was said to him: Follow \r\n    this route. He said: I will not proceed by this route. The non-Muslim guides \r\n    said to him: We will show you a way that is better than his way, and cities \r\n    that are of greater importance than his cities, that have not been conquered \r\n    yet, but Allaah will grant you victory over them if Allaah wills. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he travelled to the city of Qarmoonah. He sent ahead to \r\n    it the non-Muslims who were with him. There was no more strongly fortified \r\n    city in Andalusia than this, and none that was less likely to be conquered \r\n    by means of fighting or siege. It was said to him when he drew close to it: \r\n    It will not be taken except with diplomacy. He sent ahead to it non-Muslims \r\n    to whom he had granted safety and who he felt could be trusted, such as \r\n    Julian, and they may have been companions of Julian. They came to them, \r\n    bearing arms, and they admitted them to their city. When they entered it, he \r\n    sent the cavalry to them by night, and they opened the gate for them, and \r\n    attacked the guards, and the Muslims entered Qarmoonah.

When \r\n    the Muslims entered Spain, they did not only liberate the Jews from \r\n    persecution, but they also encouraged them to establish a civilization that \r\n    parallels in its richness and depth the most famous civilizations of all \r\n    ages.

One of the most famous historians of \r\n    Spain, Ignacio Olagi, wrote a book which became famous in the 70s, which was \r\n    called <i>The Islamic Revolution in the West<\/i>, which was summarized and \r\n    translated into Arabic by the historian Ismaa&rsquo;eel Ameen, under the title <i>\r\n    al-&lsquo;Arab lam yaghzu al-Andalus<\/i>, which was published by Riyaadh al-Rayyis \r\n    li&rsquo;l-Kutub wa&rsquo;l-Nashr. In this book, the author sought to demonstrate that \r\n    conversion to Islam in Andalusia only took place because of the spread of \r\n    ideas and a conflict between ideas, then the domination of what the author \r\n    calls the strongest idea, which formed the basis of the Islamic Arab \r\n    civilizations in three quarters of the known world at that time. Despite the \r\n    exaggerated criticism in the book of everything that is well known about the \r\n    history of Andalusia, what concerns us here are a few texts which show that \r\n    the introduction of Islam to Andalusia was not done by force, rather it was \r\n    an opening of hearts and an illumination of minds. I hope the reader will \r\n    put up with the length of the text that is quoted here, because it is one of \r\n    the most brilliant texts that have been written by the enemies of Islam \r\n    concerning a matter that those who bear grudges keep stirring up. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says on pp. 55-66:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Thus the foreign invasion is reduced to a passing incident \r\n    in a civil war. Is there any connection at all between this military event, \r\n    on the one hand, and the fact that the Iberians embraced Islam, then \r\n    developed an Islamic civilization in Iberia, on the other? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;With regard to the myth of invasion, we have accurate \r\n    figures. Taariq, along with seven thousand men, arrived to defeat Roderic, \r\n    and Moosa ibn Nusayr arrived at the head of eighteen thousand men to \r\n    subjugate the Iberians to his rule. Twenty-five thousand men introduced this \r\n    huge change to the Latin language, Christianity and monogamy. In one fell \r\n    swoop the Iberians changed their customs, traditions and religion. After \r\n    this great achievement, the Muslims hastened without bringing in any \r\n    reinforcements or consolidating their gains, to invade France.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Despite that, it remains to be explained how this \r\n    transformation of the people of Iberia, which was fortified geographically \r\n    and naturally, was completed in such a speedy manner, by small numbers of \r\n    people to whom many miracles are attributed, especially since the Iberians \r\n    and the conquerors did not share a common origin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obvious that an army of this type could have been \r\n    absorbed into these multitudes (of indigenous people) when that army took \r\n    this risk and penetrated deep into that land, let alone the fact that the \r\n    Iberians, throughout their long history, had never been a peaceful people \r\n    when confronted with such events. Was it not possible for them to launch a \r\n    guerrilla campaign, the type of warfare that they introduced to the world? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What did the Iberians do at this time? After 711 CE, history \r\n    does not tell us anything about them, even though ten million souls &ndash; \r\n    according to the lowest estimate &ndash; did not disappear in one fell swoop \r\n    during that blessed era when there were no means of mass destruction. It \r\n    would have taken the conquerors a long time to butcher this number of people \r\n    by the sword, and the small valleys of Asturias could not have absorbed this \r\n    number of refugees. It is enough for these valleys that they served as \r\n    fortresses for the few rebels who later formed the core of the Christian \r\n    kingdom. Thus ten million Iberians disappeared from the pages of history. If \r\n    the conquest of Christian land by the &ldquo;heathens&rdquo; (i.e., Muslims) started on \r\n    such a huge scale, then how can we explain that its people converted to \r\n    Islam, adopting Arabic, Islamic culture? Either all of them were killed or \r\n    they were enslaved, or they fled to the mountains, or their existence was \r\n    simply ignored by the historians. How and why did the human communities who \r\n    were located in the Byzantine regions of Asia, Egypt, North Africa and the \r\n    Iberian Peninsula embrace a new faith and a new concept of the universe? It \r\n    may be easy to turn the myth of the Arab conquests, which are impossible in \r\n    geographical and historical terms, into facts, but we cannot deny that \r\n    Islamic, Arabic civilization spread in all these regions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some researchers may be astonished when they realize from the \r\n    reports that the number of conquerors was only twenty-five thousand and they \r\n    destroyed ten million!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In fact the process of embracing the Islamic religion \r\n    continued and took between two and three centuries to complete. It was a \r\n    complete conversion, which left only a few islands whose existence is \r\n    regarded as dubious. How can we explain this leaving of Christianity and \r\n    this embrace of Islam as being by means of force?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What were its consequences?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some historians accepted the traditional prepared answer to \r\n    these questions, and some others were utterly confused.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They were unable to understand the way in which the peoples \r\n    of Egypt and the Byzantine region submitted to what they call &ldquo;Bedouin \r\n    laws&rdquo;. Kazafi Plan Hall stated in his book <i>al-&lsquo;Aalam al-Islami<\/i> (the \r\n    Islamic World) that Islam was always a religion of the city, but let us \r\n    assume nevertheless that they were subjugated forcefully by Bedouin groups. \r\n    Why did they give up all their civilized ways for these Bedouins? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Byzantine regions enjoyed an advanced civil life; their \r\n    cities were prosperous and large. The number of inhabitants in Antioch was \r\n    300,000, and among the four hundred Byzantine dioceses, 371 were in Asia. \r\n    Hence we see the importance of the Islamic victory at the intellectual \r\n    level. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Do we have to imagine that the city-dwellers were dazzled by \r\n    the culture of those who were coming in from that vast wilderness? It seems \r\n    impossible if all that these Bedouin had was the sword.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Religious fanaticism and misunderstanding, resulting from \r\n    lack of awareness and sometimes deliberate, concealed in the midst of lies \r\n    and myths an important chapter in the history of thr spread of Islam along \r\n    the eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean. In accordance with a \r\n    primitive interpretation of history, they interpreted this giant spiritual, \r\n    social and cultural transformation in the seventh and eighth centuries CE &ndash; \r\n    in the eastern and Mediterranean worlds &ndash; as the result of military conquest \r\n    that imposed language, culture and religion by means of a curved sword. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Force does not explain everything.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In fact the historians confused the spread of brilliant ideas \r\n    that a certain civilization carries with military abilities that do not lead \r\n    to anything but the emergence of temporary empires that diminish with the \r\n    passage of time. They confused intellectual power with material strength.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From the study of similar movements, we may conclude that the \r\n    spread of Islam was the result of an idea combined with strength; it was not \r\n    the result of the ability to launch a military attack. Just as Hellenic \r\n    civilization was dominant in the past, and the West is dominant today, the \r\n    domination of Islam could only be the result of this interaction between \r\n    ideas and strength.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Continuing to believe that people could be invaded in their \r\n    own country by a destructive civilization, and that they gave up their \r\n    beliefs and changed their customs because a group of courageous horsemen \r\n    defeated them militarily, does not indicate anything but a childish and \r\n    foolish concept of how societies function and develop.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The military aspect of these events should be retracted and \r\n    regarded merely as a minor issue that is no more than an interesting aspect \r\n    of some individual lives. We should understand this problem from an \r\n    intellectual and cultural perspective.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There was no military aggression, rather there was a \r\n    revolutionary crisis, and a call conveyed by the scholars, not by the \r\n    generals.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Scholars alone can understand the movement of peoples and are \r\n    able to lead them. Military domination could not have lasted for eight \r\n    centuries in Andalusia or forever in huge areas of the world.

But it is essential that the \r\n    troops be organized and sent in an orderly fashion, lest it lead to chaos \r\n    and incidents that bring unfortunate consequences. Hence initiation of and \r\n    engagement in jihad is the responsibility of the ruler of the Muslims, and \r\n    the scholars must encourage him. If he initiates the jihad and mobilizes the \r\n    Muslims, then the one who is able to do so must respond to the call, \r\n    sincerely seeking the Countenance of Allaah, and in the hope of supporting \r\n    the truth, and to protect Islam.

When they \r\n    come together, it is essential to have a leader. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If three people set out on a \r\n    journey, let them appoint one of them in charge.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood \r\n    from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&rsquo;eed and Abu Hurayrah. Imam Ahmad narrated in his\r\n    <i>Musnad<\/i> from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It is not permissible for three \r\n    people to be in the wilderness without appointing one of them in charge.&rdquo; \r\n    The fact that it is obligatory to appoint one person in charge of a small \r\n    temporary group whilst travelling indicates that this is essential in all \r\n    kinds of groups. And Allaah has commanded us to enjoin what is good and \r\n    forbid what is evil, which can only be achieved from a position of strength \r\n    and authority, and the same applies to all the other things that He has \r\n    enjoined, such as jihad, justice, establishment of Hajj, Jumu&rsquo;ah and Eid, as \r\n    well as supporting those who are wronged or oppressed, and carrying out hadd \r\n    punishments &ndash; it cannot be achieved except from a position of strength and \r\n    authority. Hence it was narrated that &ldquo;the ruler is the shadow of Allaah on \r\n    earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sixty years with (even) an unjust ruler are better than one \r\n    night without a ruler.&rdquo; Experience proves that this is so.

Individuals have to follow the decision-makers. So it is not \r\n    permissible for anyone to fight without the permission of the imam, except \r\n    in the case of defence. If the enemy attacks them suddenly and they are \r\n    afraid of his evil, then they may defend themselves, because fighting \r\n    becomes an individual obligation in that case. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason why \r\n    that is not permitted is because the matter of jihad is the ruler&rsquo;s \r\n    responsibility, and fighting without his permission is a transgression \r\n    against his rights and over stepping the mark. If it were permissible for \r\n    the people to fight without the permission of the ruler, that would lead to \r\n    chaos. Everyone who wanted to would mount his horse and go fight, and if the \r\n    people were allowed to do that it would lead to many negative consequences. \r\n    Some people would equip themselves on the grounds that they want to fight \r\n    the enemy but their real aim would be to rebel against the ruler, or to \r\n    spread evil by attacking another group of people, as Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And if two \r\n    parties (or groups) among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace \r\n    between them both&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Hujuraat \r\n    49:9]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>For these three \r\n    reasons and others it is not permissible to fight without the permission of \r\n    the ruler.

The purpose behind detaining \r\n    prisoners is so that the Muslims may be protected from their evil.

If that is not possible then it should be with \r\n    one's heart (i.e., by hating the evil and feeling that it is wrong).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are the thirteen types of jihad, and &#8220;Whoever dies \r\n    without having fought or having resolved to fight has died following one of \r\n    the branches of hypocrisy.&#8221; (Narrated by Muslim, 1910).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad<\/i>, 3\/9-11)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &#8220;Jihad is of various kinds, with one&#8217;s self, one's wealth, by \r\n    making du&#8217;aa&#8217;, by teaching and guiding, by helping to do good in any way. \r\n    The greatest form of jihad is jihad with one&#8217;s self (i.e., going oneself and \r\n    fighting), followed by jihad with one's wealth, jihad by speaking out and \r\n    guiding others. Da&#8217;wah is also part of jihad.&nbsp; But going out oneself to \r\n    fight in jihad is the highest form.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (<i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, 7\/334, 335)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The idea of waging physical jihad against the kaafirs went \r\n    through a number of stages, depending on the state in which the Muslim ummah \r\n    was. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &#8220;The first thing which his Lord revealed to him was to read \r\n    in the name of his Lord who had created.

Initially the command is \r\n    addressed to all of them, as in the case of an individual obligation (fard \r\n    &#8216;ayn), but then in the case of fard kafaayah the obligation is dropped if \r\n    enough of the people undertake to do it, unlike the case with fard &#8216;ayn \r\n    where the obligation is not dropped if someone else does it. Jihad is a fard \r\n    kafaayah, according to the majority of scholars.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 9\/163)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Azeez ibn Baaz said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &#8220;We have previously explained on more than one occasion that \r\n    jihad is fard kafaayah, not fard &#8216;ayn. All Muslims are enjoined to support \r\n    their brothers with their selves (i.e., physically, by joining them), or \r\n    with money, weapons, da&#8217;wah and advice. If enough of them go out (to fight), \r\n    the rest are freed from sin, but if none of them do that then all of them \r\n    are sinners.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Africa, North Africa and \r\n    elsewhere are obliged to do their utmost, and if there is a jihad in one \r\n    country, the surrounding countries should hasten to help them, the closest \r\n    then the next closest.&nbsp; If one or two states, or three or more, manage to \r\n    fulfil the obligation, then the rest are freed of responsibility. They \r\n    deserve to be supported, and it is obligatory to help them against their \r\n    enemies, because they are oppressed. Allaah has enjoined jihad upon all \r\n    Muslims, and they must fight against the enemies of Allaah until their \r\n    brothers are victorious.

This is the first of the situations in \r\n    which jihad becomes an individual obligation, because Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&#8220;O you who believe!

He said: &#8220;Avoid the seven sins that doom a \r\n    person to Hell&#8230;&#8221; among which he mentioned running away on the day when the \r\n    army is advancing (agreed upon). But Allaah has made exceptions in two \r\n    cases:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When it is a military \r\n    manoeuvre, in the sense that he is leaving to bring reinforcements.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When he is going to join \r\n    another group, when he has been told that there is a group of Muslims \r\n    elsewhere who are about to be defeated, so he goes to join them in order to \r\n    strengthen their numbers. This is subject to the condition that there is no \r\n    risk to the group he is in; if there is a risk to the group that he is in, \r\n    then it is not permissible for him to go to the other group. In this case \r\n    (jihad) is an individual obligation upon him (fard &#8216;ayn) and it is not \r\n    permissible for him to leave. <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second situation (in which jihad becomes an individual \r\n    obligation) is when a city is besieged by the enemy. Then he has to fight in \r\n    defence of the city, because when the city is besieged there is no \r\n    alternative but to defend it, for if the enemy is going to prevent people \r\n    from leaving the city or entering it, and prevent provisions from reaching \r\n    it, and other things which are well known, then in this case the people of \r\n    the city are obliged to fight in order to defend their city.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third situation is when the leader tells the people to \r\n    mobilize; the leader (imam) is the highest authority in the state, but he \r\n    need not necessarily be the leader of all the Muslims, because there has \r\n    been no leader of all the Muslims (khaleefah) for a long time.

This is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is that a man came to the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, if I am killed for the sake of Allaah, and bear that \r\n    with patience, seeking the reward of Allaah, will that expiate for my sins? \r\n    He said: &ldquo;Yes, except for debt.

This was stated by Ahmad concerning one who leaves behind enough \r\n    to pay it off. That is because &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Haraam, the father of Jaabir \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah, went out to Uhud, and he owed a great debt. He was martyred \r\n    and his son paid off his debt, with the knowledge of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not criticize him for that, rather he \r\n    praised him and said: &ldquo;The angels continued to shade him with their wings, \r\n    until you lifted him (from the battlefield).&rdquo; And he said to his son Jaabir: \r\n    &ldquo;Do you know that Allaah brought your father to life and spoke to him \r\n    directly?&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Its says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (16\/135):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if jihad becomes an \r\n    individual obligation, there is no dispute among the scholars that there is \r\n    no need for permission from the creditor.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: In the event that the debtor has enough money to \r\n    pay off the debt, does going out for jihad take precedence, or paying off \r\n    the debt?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that if jihad is a communal obligation, then \r\n    paying off the debt takes precedence, but if jihad is an individual \r\n    obligation, then one of the following two scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If jihad is an individual \r\n    obligation because he has joined the ranks of the mujaahideen, or the enemy \r\n    has come to his land, then jihad must take precedence.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If jihad is an individual \r\n    obligation because the ruler has asked him to go out for jihad, then paying \r\n    off the debt must take precedence.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (p. 308):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I was asked about a man who owed a debt and had enough to pay \r\n    it off, but jihad had become an individual obligation for him. I said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are some duties that take precedence over paying off a \r\n    debt, such as spending on oneself, one's wife and one's poor son. And there \r\n    are some which are superceded by the obligation to pay off a debt, such as \r\n    acts of worship like Hajj and expiations. And there are some which supercede \r\n    it unless the creditor is asking for his money, such as sadaqat al-fitr. If \r\n    jihad becomes an individual obligation in order to ward off harm, such as if \r\n    the enemy has come (to where he is) or he has joined the ranks of the \r\n    mujaahideen, then it takes precedence over paying off his debt, as in the \r\n    case of spending (on himself and his family), and more so. If he is asked to \r\n    go out for jihad by the ruler, then paying off his debt takes precedence, \r\n    because the ruler should not ask a debtor to go out for jihad if he is able \r\n    to do without him. Hence I say that if there is not enough money to feed the \r\n    hungry and wage jihad without which harm will be caused, then jihad must \r\n    take precedence even if the hungry people die.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I also say that if the creditors are engaged in jihad by \r\n    spending the money that they are asking the debtors to pay, then the debts \r\n    must be paid off, so as to achieve two aims: paying off debts and engaging \r\n    in jihad.

This is an established truth of Islam. \r\n    This jihad is obligatory when its conditions are met and the relevant \r\n    rulings apply. It is not one of these conditions or rulings that jihad \r\n    should be delayed until what is promised comes to pass. This is not the way \r\n    in which the first Muslims understood it and how they acted. Indeed, when \r\n    they were told that Allaah would destroy the power of Chosroes with their \r\n    swords they did not stay in their houses waiting for the news to come true \r\n    and for that event to happen without any effort on their part. No, rather \r\n    they prepared themselves for that and made themselves ready until victory \r\n    came and thus the promise coincided with the decree of Allaah. But some of \r\n    the Muslims nowadays say no: jihad against the Jews must wait until the \r\n    Dajjaal appears. Perhaps this is part of the trial (fitnah) of the Dajjaal \r\n    in this world.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This negative talk has affected some of the Muslim youth, so \r\n    they do not feel any kind of responsibility towards al-Masjid al-Aqsa, the \r\n    environs of which Allaah has blessed. It has even led many of them to \r\n    believe more foolish ideas, namely that the Islamic state and the caliphate \r\n    will not be established until the Mahdi comes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I wonder about those who \r\n    propagate such ideas. It is as if they are saying to the Jews: Be harsh \r\n    towards your enemies&hellip; and to the Christians: Carry on with your aggression&hellip; \r\n    and to the Muslims: carry on being fragmented and disputing and being \r\n    useless until the Mahdi comes to you. I do not know on what their argument \r\n    is based, or how they imagine that the Mahdi will come to people who are \r\n    doing nothing or will support people who are apathetic.

Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In order for jihad to be \r\n    obligatory there are seven conditions: being Muslim, being an adult, being \r\n    of sound mind, being free, being male, being physically sound and being able \r\n    to afford it financially. With regard to being Muslim, adult and of sound \r\n    mind, these are essential conditions for all Islamic duties, because a \r\n    kaafir is not to be trusted in jihad, an insane person cannot go for jihad \r\n    and a child is physically weak. Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: &ldquo;I presented myself to the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the \r\n    day of Uhud when I was fourteen years old, and he did not let me join the \r\n    fighting.&rdquo; Agreed upon. &hellip; With regard to being male, this is stipulated \r\n    because of the report narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah who said: &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, do women have to engage in jihad? He said: &ldquo;Jihad in which there is \r\n    no fighting: Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah.&rdquo; And because women are not able to fight \r\n    because they are (physically) weak.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 9\/163.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was \r\n    narrated by Ahmad (25361) and Ibn Maajah (2901); classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Can a woman go out to help the mujaahideen and treat the \r\n    wounded?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Sarkhasi said in <i>Sharh al-Siyar al-Kabeer<\/i> (1\/184): \r\n    Chapter on women fighting alongside men and being present in war: He said: \r\n    we do not like women to fight alongside men in war because a woman does not \r\n    have the right physical make-up for fighting, as the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicated when he said: \r\n    &ldquo;This one was not a fighter&rdquo; (said when he saw the body of a woman slain on \r\n    the battlefield). And when a woman fights, the &lsquo;awrah of the Muslims may \r\n    become exposed and the mushrikeen will rejoice at that, and that may be a \r\n    cause of the mushrikeen increasing their hopes of defeating the Muslims, and \r\n    they may think that the Muslims are weak because they had to bring the women \r\n    to fight, so they will say, &lsquo;They need the help of women to fight us.&rdquo; So \r\n    this should be avoided. For this reason it is not recommended for women to \r\n    participate directly in the fighting. But if the Muslims have no choice and \r\n    are forced to do that, because repelling the kuffaar when necessary by \r\n    whatever means the Muslims have at their disposal, is permissible, rather it \r\n    is obligatory. The story of Hunayn is quoted as evidence for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    At the end of this story it says: Umm Sulaym bint Milhaan, \r\n    who was fighting that day with a cloth tied around her stomach, said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about these people who ran away from \r\n    you and let you down? You should not forgive them if Allaah gives you power \r\n    over them.&rdquo; He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O Umm \r\n    Sulaym, the forgiveness of Allaah is immense.&rdquo; She repeated that three \r\n    times, and each time the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The mercy of Allaah is immense.&rdquo; In <i>\r\n    al-Maghaazi<\/i> it is narrated that she said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, should \r\n    we not kill these who ran away (from the battlefield) as we killed the \r\n    mushrikeen?&rdquo; He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:&nbsp; &ldquo;The \r\n    forgiveness of Allaah is immense.&rdquo; What greater need can there be for women \r\n    to fight than this incident when the men fled and abandoned the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This clearly shows \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with women fighting when that is essential, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not \r\n    prevent this woman from fighting on that occasion. But it is not narrated \r\n    that he gave the women permission to fight on other occasions. There is \r\n    nothing wrong with old women being present at times of war to tend the \r\n    wounded, bring water and cook food for the soldiers if they need that, \r\n    because of the hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Qarat al-Azdi who said: The \r\n    womenfolk of Khaalid ibn al-Waleed and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah had \r\n    their sleeves rolled up, bringing water to the mujaahideen and reciting \r\n    encouraging poetry, when he was fighting the Byzantines. What is meant here \r\n    is old women, because young women are not allowed to go out for fear of \r\n    fitnah, and old women can take care of the needs in such situations. And it \r\n    was narrated that Umm Mutaa&rsquo;, who was present at Khaybar with the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), said: I saw \r\n    Aslam (one of the Arab tribes) when they complained to the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the \r\n    difficulties they were facing, so he recommended that they engage in jihad \r\n    and they responded. I saw that Aslam were the first ones to reach the \r\n    fortress and the sun did not set on that day until Allaah had enabled us to \r\n    conquer it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This clearly shows that \r\n    she went out with the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him), and he did not forbid her to do so. From this we know \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with an old woman going out to help the \r\n    mujaahideen by doing tasks that are appropriate for them. And Allaah is the \r\n    Source of strength. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Khishshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo; <\/i>(3\/26): Women are not \r\n    allowed (to engage in jihad) because they are a source of temptation, as \r\n    well as not being qualified to fight, because of their natural tendency to \r\n    be weak and cowardly, and because there is no guarantee that the enemy will \r\n    not capture them and regard it as permissible to do to them that which \r\n    Allaah has forbidden. Some of the scholars said: except the wife of the \r\n    ruler or commander, who may be present to attend to his needs, because of \r\n    the actions of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him), or an old women in cases of need only, such as giving water to \r\n    the troops and treating the wounded, because al-Rubayyi&rsquo; bint Mu&rsquo;awwidh \r\n    said: &ldquo;We used to go out to fight with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him), bringing water and serving them, bringing back the \r\n    wounded and the slain to Madeenah.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari. And a similar \r\n    report was narrated from Anas by Muslim. That is because men may be \r\n    distracted from these tasks by fighting, so this is a help to the Muslims \r\n    and supporting them in their fight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of this has to do with jihad in cases where the enemy has \r\n    not invaded the Muslim land, in which case jihad becomes obligatory on every \r\n    able-bodied person, man or woman, and a woman may then go out without her \r\n    husband&rsquo;s permission. Al-Kaasaani al-Hanafi (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;But at times of general mobilization, such as when the enemy is \r\n    seeking to invade a Muslim land, then it becomes an individual obligation \r\n    (fard &lsquo;ayn) on every single Muslim who is able to fight, because Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young \r\n    and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Tawbah 9:41]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was said that this was revealed concerning general \r\n    mobilization.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;It was not becoming of the people of Al-Madinah and the \r\n    bedouins of the neighbourhood to remain behind Allaah&rsquo;s Messenger (Muhammad \r\n    r<span> <\/span>when \r\n    fighting in Allaah&rsquo;s Cause) and (it was not becoming of them) to prefer \r\n    their own lives to his life&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Tawbah 9:120]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From <i>Badaa&rsquo;i&rsquo; al-Sanaa&rsquo;i&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/98&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says something similar in <i>al-Sharh al-Sagheer<\/i>, one \r\n    of the Maaliki books (2\/274): that if the enemy attacks a Muslim land, then \r\n    jihad becomes an individual obligation for every man and woman.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In conclusion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Jihad is not obligatory for women in principle, except in \r\n    cases of necessity, such as if the kuffaar attack a Muslim land, in which \r\n    case jihad becomes obligatory for women, according to their abilities.

So &ldquo;<i>What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to \r\n    march forth in the Cause of Allaah (i.e. Jihaad) you cling heavily to the \r\n    earth?<\/i>&rdquo; meaning, why are you so lazy and so inclined towards this \r\n    world.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;<i>Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than \r\n    the Hereafter?<\/i>&rdquo; Your case is that of those who are content with this \r\n    world and who strive for worldly purposes, caring nothing for the Hereafter \r\n    because they do not believe in it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;<i>But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    towards which you are inclined and which you prefer. Hasn&rsquo;t Allaah given you \r\n    reason with which to weigh up matters and see which deserves to be shown \r\n    preference?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is not this world &ndash; from beginning to end &ndash; as nothing in \r\n    comparison to the Hereafter?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is a man's lifespan in comparison to the lifespan of \r\n    this world, so as to make worldly gain his ultimate goal and concern and \r\n    restrict all his efforts and focus to this short life that is filled with \r\n    distress and risk? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How can you possibly prefer it to the Hereafter which \r\n    includes every kind of delight that a person could desire, where you will \r\n    abide forever? No person who prefers this world to the Hereafter has faith \r\n    rooted in his heart and he cannot be regarded as a man of wisdom and \r\n    understanding. Then Allaah warns them if they do not march forth, as He \r\n    says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;<i>If you march not forth, He will punish you with a painful \r\n    torment<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; in this world and in the Hereafter, for not marching forth \r\n    when ordered to do so is a major sin that deserves the most severe \r\n    punishment, because it causes a great deal of harm, because the one who \r\n    stays behind(from jihad) has disobeyed Allaah and done something that He has \r\n    forbidden, and he has not helped to support the religion of Allaah or to \r\n    protect the Book of Allaah and His Law. He has not helped his Muslim \r\n    brothers against the enemy who wants to uproot them and eradicate their \r\n    religion.&nbsp; Perhaps others who are weak in faith will follow his example, and \r\n    he may even discourage those who are involved in fighting the enemies of \r\n    Allaah. Thus he will be like those whom Allaah has warned of a severe \r\n    punishment: &ldquo;<i>If you march not forth, He will punish you with a painful \r\n    torment<\/i>&rdquo; Allaah has promised to support His religion and make His word \r\n    supreme regardless of whether you obey the command of Allaah or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;<i>and Allaah is Able to do all things<\/i>&rdquo; He is not \r\n    incapable of doing anything that He wants, and none can overwhelm Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to bring the Muslims back to their religion and \r\n    to remove humiliation from them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7727","question_id":"7727","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We have already stated in \r\n    question no. <span>\r\n    [fatout]34830[\\fatout]<\/span> \r\n    that jihad is of two types: taking the initiative in fighting and jihad in \r\n    self-defence. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly taking the initiative in fighting has a great \r\n    effect in spreading Islam and bringing people into the religion of Allaah in \r\n    crowds.

This goes against what the Muslim scholars have stated, let \r\n    alone the fact that it goes against the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, \r\n    28\/263.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The purpose is that all religion should be for Allaah alone, \r\n    and that the word of Allaah should be supreme. The word of Allaah is a \r\n    comprehensive phrase that refers to His words that are contained in His \r\n    Book. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and \r\n    revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may \r\n    keep up justice&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hadeed 57:25]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The purpose behind \r\n    sending the Messengers and revealing the Books was so that mankind might \r\n    keep up justice with regard to the rights of Allaah and the rights of His \r\n    creation. Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in \r\n    matters of war), as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allaah may test \r\n    who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the \r\n    unseen&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hadeed 27:25]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So whoever deviates from the Book is to be brought back with \r\n    iron, i.e. by force. Hence the soundness of the religion is based on the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and the Sword. It was narrated that Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to strike with this, meaning \r\n    the sword, whoever turns away from this, meaning the Qur&rsquo;aan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Faroosiyyah<\/i> (p.18):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah sent him &ndash; meaning \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &ndash; with the \r\n    guiding Book and the conquering sword, ahead of the Hour, so that Allaah \r\n    alone would be worshipped with no partner or associate, and his provision \r\n    was placed beneath the shade of his sword and spear.

Then he (the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, &ldquo;Where is &lsquo;Ali?&rdquo; It was said, &ldquo;His \r\n    eye is hurting.&rdquo; So he spat in his eyes and made du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for him, and he was \r\n    healed, as if there had not been anything wrong with him. Then he gave him \r\n    the flag and he [&lsquo;Ali] said: &ldquo;Shall I fight them so that they will be like \r\n    us?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Go ahead, until you reach their encampment, then call them \r\n    to Islam and tell them what they are obliged to do, for by Allaah if Allaah \r\n    were to guide a man at your hands that would be better for you than having \r\n    red camels [the best kind].&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So this call to Islam was accompanied by the force of arms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslim (3261) narrated that Buraydah said: When the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed a \r\n    commander to lead an army or a raiding party, he would advise him to fear \r\n    Allaah with regard to himself and the Muslims with him, then he said: &ldquo;Fight \r\n    in the name of Allaah and for the sake of Allaah. Fight those who disbelieve \r\n    in Allaah, fight but do not steal from the war booty (before it is shared \r\n    out), betray, or mutilate. Do not kill children. If you meet your enemy of \r\n    the mushrikeen, call them to three things, and whichever one of them they \r\n    respond to, accept that from them and leave them alone.&nbsp; Then call them to \r\n    Islam and if they respond, accept that from them and leave them alone.

Many people are foolish and lacking \r\n    in wisdom and knowledge, and if they are left to their own devices they will \r\n    remain blinded to the truth, indulging in their whims and desires. So Allaah \r\n    has prescribed jihad in order to bring them back to the truth and to that \r\n    which will benefit them. Undoubtedly wisdom dictates that the fool should be \r\n    prevented from doing that which will harm him, and should be forced to do \r\n    that which will benefit him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari (4557) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo; <i>&lsquo;You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and \r\n    real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples \r\n    ever raised up for mankind&rsquo; [Aal- Imraan 3:110 &ndash; interpretation of the \r\n    meaning]<\/i>.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;You are the best (i.e., the most beneficial) of \r\n    people for mankind, you bring them in the chains that are around their necks \r\n    until they enter Islam.&rdquo; Can people be brought in chains except in the case \r\n    of jihad??&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is something for \r\n    which Islam deserves to be praised, not condemned. The defeatists should \r\n    fear Allaah lest they distort this religion and cause it to become weak on \r\n    the basis of the claim that it is a religion of peace. Yes, it is the \r\n    religion of peace but in the sense of saving all of mankind from worshipping \r\n    anything other than Allaah and submitting all of mankind to the rule of \r\n    Allaah. This is the religion of Allaah, not the ideas of any person or the \r\n    product of human thought, so that those who promote it should feel ashamed \r\n    to state its ultimate goal, which is that all religion (worship) should be \r\n    for Allaah alone. When the ideas that people follow are all produced by \r\n    human beings and the systems and laws that control their lives are all made \r\n    up by human beings, then in this case each idea and each system has the \r\n    right to live safely within its own borders so long as it does not \r\n    transgress the borders of others, so the various ideas and laws can co-exist \r\n    and not try to destroy one another. But when there is a divine system and \r\n    law, and alongside it there are human systems and laws, then the matter is \r\n    fundamentally different, and the divine law has the right to remove the \r\n    barriers and free people from enslavement to human beings&hellip;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>Fiqh al-Da&rsquo;wah<\/i> by Sayyid Qutb, 217-222.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah <\/i>(12\/14): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam spread by means of proof and evidence to those who \r\n    listened to the message and responded to it, and it spread by means of force \r\n    and the sword to those who were stubborn and arrogant, until they were \r\n    overwhelmed and became no longer stubborn, and submitted to that reality.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7728","question_id":"7728","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslims are obliged to help their oppressed brothers in \r\n    all places.

The \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aanic command mentions jihad with one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s wealth in several \r\n    places, and the apparent meaning of the command is that it is obligatory. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i>, \r\n    p. 530:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever is unable to take part in jihad physically but is \r\n    able to take part in jihad by means of his wealth, is obliged to take part \r\n    in jihad by means of his wealth.

The same applies \r\n    to the wealth of minors if there is a need, just as it is also obligatory to \r\n    pay zakaah on this wealth. But if the enemy attacks, there is no room for \r\n    differences of opinion, because in that case it is obligatory according to \r\n    scholarly consensus, to ward off their harm to religious commitment, lives \r\n    and honour. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Spending for the sake of Allaah is one of the best kinds of \r\n    charity, for which Allaah has promised a great reward.

The Muslim countries are not all the \r\n    same with regard to how closely or otherwise they adhere to the laws of Islam.

Their honour was not considered to be permissible to anyone by way of prostitution, which was the fate \r\n    of female prisoners of war in most cases. Rather Islam made them the property of their masters alone, and forbade anyone else to also have \r\n    intercourse with them, even if that was his son. Islam made it their right to become free through a contract of manumission; it encouraged setting \r\n    them free and promised reward for that. Islam made setting slaves free an obligation in the case of some kinds of expiation (kafaarah), such as \r\n    the expiation for accidental killing, zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce in which a man said to his wife, &ldquo;You are to me as my mother&rsquo;s back&rdquo;), and \r\n    breaking oaths.

If the Muslim is in such a land, then he has \r\n    to leave it, so how about if he chooses to go and live in the land and among \r\n    those people who openly practise shirk in the name of Islam and revile the \r\n    Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and denounce Ahl al-Sunnah as \r\n    disbelievers?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    describing the types of migration:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; The second is migration from the land of innovation.

They quoted as evidence the fact that a man came to the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during the year of \r\n    the conquest (of Makkah) and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I vowed that if \r\n    Allaah enabled you to conquer Makkah, I would pray in Bayt al-Maqdis \r\n    (Jerusalem).&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Pray here.&rdquo; He repeated what he had said, and (the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said: &ldquo;Pray here.&rdquo; \r\n    He repeated it and he said: &ldquo;Pray here.&rdquo; He repeated it and he said, &ldquo;It is \r\n    up to you then.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A waqf is like a vow, so if the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) permitted the one who had made a vow to \r\n    change it to that which was better, then the same applies to one who has \r\n    donated a waqf. This is the correct view, that it is permissible to change \r\n    the conditions stipulated by the waqf donor to that which is better, so long \r\n    as the waqf is not donated for the benefit of a specific person. If the waqf \r\n    is donated for a specific person then it is not permissible to change it to \r\n    something that is better, because it is specific and the right belongs to a \r\n    specific person, so it cannot be changed.

Poverty has negative effects on people&rsquo;s \r\n    beliefs and conduct. Many Christian missionaries exploit the poverty and \r\n    want of some peoples to spread Christianity among their ranks. Similarly, \r\n    immoral behaviour becomes widespread to a large extent because of poverty, \r\n    as a means of meeting people&rsquo;s needs, so theft, murder, zina and sale of \r\n    haraam things become widespread. Undoubtedly these things have a negative \r\n    effect on individuals and societies. Allaah tells us that some of the \r\n    mushrikeen used to kill their children, the apples of their eyes, either \r\n    because of the poverty in which they were living or for fear of poverty that \r\n    might befall them. Allaah says of the first case (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;kill not your children \r\n    because of poverty &mdash; We provide sustenance for you and for them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:151]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And He says of the second \r\n    case (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And kill not your \r\n    children for fear of poverty.

Then Allaah saved her from that after she reminded him of Allaah and \r\n    told him to fear Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whatever the case, it is \r\n    well known that poverty leads to crimes and corruption.

Many nations entered Islam \r\n    because of the trustworthiness and honesty of the Muslim traders. \r\n    Conversely, if a Muslim is treacherous or tells lies, this puts people off \r\n    Islam and turns them away from the path of Allaah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a Muslim enters daar al-harb (non-Muslim lands) in safety \r\n    and gains some control over any of their wealth, it is not permissible for \r\n    him to take anything of it, great or small, because if they have granted him \r\n    safety then they are entitled to the same from him, and because it is not \r\n    permissible for him to take anything from them when he is under their \r\n    protection except that which he would be permitted to take from the wealth \r\n    of the Muslims or of ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim \r\n    protection).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Umm<\/i>, 4\/284.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because you have agreed upon a specific salary with the \r\n    company, it is not permissible for you to take anything extra without the \r\n    knowledge of the company owner. The claim that they are not giving you what \r\n    you deserve is no excuse. If you open this door, then every worker will make \r\n    similar claims and rights and trusts will be lost.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly it is not permissible for you to give discounts to \r\n    anyone or to waive the price altogether. This money is not yours to do that \r\n    with. You have to take the price in full no matter who the customers are.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So what you both have to do is to repent to Allaah by giving \r\n    up what you are doing, regretting it and resolving not to do it again. You \r\n    also have to give back to the company what belongs to it, namely whatever \r\n    you took in addition to your salary and the discounts that you allowed to \r\n    your acquaintances and friends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]14367[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7777","question_id":"7777","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the \r\n    second job requires leaving the workplace of the first job, then it is clear \r\n    that this is not permitted, because it is breaking the conditions of the \r\n    first job.

This led to an increase of \r\n    capital for one group in society, so the balance was tipped and the class \r\n    system emerged, with consequences which are contrary to the words of Allaah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;in order that it may not become a \r\n    fortune used by the rich among you&rdquo; [al-Hashr 59:7]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Despite the so-called freedom, we find that their solution to \r\n    the problem is interference of the state, with its authority, to nationalise \r\n    the banks and financial institutions and pump money into buying assets, \r\n    changing the system and limiting the freedom of owners in order to protect \r\n    economic institutions from collapse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    14.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Decline of capitalist principles&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This crisis has exposed the failure of the capitalist system \r\n    and its inability to achieve financial security, balance and social and \r\n    economic justice between the various groups of society.

The basic principle with regard to medical treatment is \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with using anything that is proven to be \r\n    beneficial and useful in treating sickness.

It was narrated \r\n    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah has not sent down \r\n    any sickness but He has sent down a remedy for it.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhari, \r\n    5678. It was narrated that Abu&rsquo;d-Darda&rsquo; said: The Messenger of Allah (sa) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Allah has created the sickness and the remedy, so treat sickness but \r\n    do not treat sickness with anything that is haraam.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    at-Tabaraani in <i>al-Mu&lsquo;jam al-Kabeer<\/i>, 24\/254; classed as saheeh by \r\n    Shaykh al-Albaani in <i>as-Silsilah as-Saheehah<\/i>, 1633&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If something is not proven to be beneficial according to \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah or according to trial or experience, then it is not permissible to \r\n    use it to treat sickness; that in turn implies that it is not permissible to \r\n    sell it for the purpose of treating sickness or as a remedy, because that is \r\n    helping in sin and transgression.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    explaining the means that it is permissible to use for treating sickness:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The means that Allah, may He be exalted, has caused to be \r\n    means are of two types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Means that are prescribed in Islam, such as the Holy Qur&rsquo;an \r\n    and du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; (supplication), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) said concerning Soorat al-Faatihah: &ldquo;How did you know it is a \r\n    ruqyah?&rdquo; And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to \r\n    perform ruqyah for the sick by offering du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; asking Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, to heal by means of his du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; whomever He wanted to heal thereby.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Physical means such as regular medicine that is known through \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah, such as honey, and through trial and experience, such as many \r\n    other kinds of medicine and remedies. For this category, the effect should \r\n    be direct, not by way of imagination. If it is proven that something has a \r\n    direct effect, then it is valid to be used to treat sickness and healing \r\n    will be achieved thereby, by Allah&rsquo;s leave. But if it is just something \r\n    imaginary that the sick person imagines will bring him psychological relief \r\n    based on that imagination and that it will alleviate the sickness, and \r\n    perhaps this psychological sense of relief may lead to recovery from \r\n    sickness, then in this case it is not permissible to rely on it and that \r\n    does not prove that it is a remedy. That is so that people will not pin \r\n    their hopes on illusions. Hence it is forbidden to wear halaqah bracelets, \r\n    strings and the like to cure or ward off disease, because that is not a \r\n    means that is prescribed in sharee&lsquo;ah, nor is it proven on the basis of \r\n    trial and experience. So long as there is no proof that it is a means of \r\n    healing in either shar&lsquo;i or scientific terms, it is not permissible to take \r\n    it as a means, because taking it as a means is a kind of contesting the \r\n    sovereignty of Allah, may He be exalted, and it is associating something \r\n    else with Him, because He is the only One Who creates cause and effect (and \r\n    such actions attribute effects to causes that Allah has not made to be \r\n    such).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa wa Rasaa&rsquo;il al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    17\/70&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So-called &ldquo;healing crystals&rdquo; are various kinds of stones, \r\n    gems or crystals that some people use to seek well-being and healing from \r\n    psychological and physical sickness, because they believe that they have \r\n    extraordinary powers to strengthen the body and heart, to bring peace of \r\n    mind and ward off anxiety, tension, depression and so on from the \r\n    individual.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, it is not permissible to use these crystals \r\n    for treating sickness, and what appears to be the case is that it is not \r\n    permissible to sell them or give them to those who will use them for this \r\n    purpose, because there is no proof that they are beneficial in treating \r\n    sickness, either from shar&lsquo;i sources or from scientific sources.

Al-Bukhaari (2737) and Muslim (1633) narrated from Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that Umar was given a share of land \r\n    in Khaybar, and he came to the Prophet (S) to consult him about it. He said: \r\n    O Messenger of Allaah, I have been given a share of land at Khaybar and I \r\n    have never been given any wealth that is more precious to me than it. What \r\n    do you command me to do with it? He said: &ldquo;If you wish, you can &lsquo;freeze&rsquo; it \r\n    and give it in charity.&rdquo; So &lsquo;Umar gave it in charity and stipulated that it \r\n    was not to be sold, given as a gift or inherited, and he gave it in charity \r\n    to the poor, relatives and slaves, for the sake of Allaah and for wayfarers \r\n    and guests; there was no sin on the one appointed to look after it if he ate \r\n    from it on a reasonable basis, and fed a friend without storing anything for \r\n    the future. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if she gave this house \r\n    as a waqf during the illness from which she died, then it comes under the \r\n    heading of a bequest, and a bequest can only apply to one-third of the \r\n    estate; any more than one-third can only be given as a waqf if the heirs \r\n    allow it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the house is no more \r\n    than one-third of her estate, then the whole house is a waqf. If it is more \r\n    than one-third, then the bequest should be executed with regard to the \r\n    equivalent of one-third of the estate, and with regard to the rest, that is \r\n    dependent upon the consent of the heir. If they do not give consent, then \r\n    they may share it out as an inheritance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (5\/365): A waqf that is given \r\n    during one&rsquo;s final illness is treated as a bequest with regard to one-third \r\n    of the estate, because it is a donation. Therefore, if it is given during \r\n    the final illness, then it is to be executed with regard to one-third of the \r\n    estate, such as freeing slaves and giving gifts. If it is less than \r\n    one-third then it may be done without the consent of the heirs and it is \r\n    binding; if it is more than one-third, the equivalent of one-third should be \r\n    made a waqf, and the additional amount may be made a waqf if the heirs give \r\n    consent.

If the \r\n    agreement between them was that your colleague would look for someone to do \r\n    these drawings, and he agreed with the boss on the money to be paid for that \r\n    job, then he was to find someone who would do the job for whatever amount \r\n    they agreed, then if any of that money is left over, it belongs to him, and \r\n    if the cost was greater, then he is to pay the extra. This is permissible \r\n    and there is nothing wrong with you taking the money that your colleague \r\n    gave you. In this case your colleague is like a contractor who takes on the \r\n    job, then assigns it to the one who will do it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But you stated that the agreement was based on the idea that \r\n    he was going to work with the engineers abroad, and that you told your \r\n    colleague about local engineers.

In that case, your colleague has to tell the boss \r\n    what really happened, and that those who are going to do the work are \r\n    engineers inside the Kingdom, not abroad, and he has to return to him the \r\n    surplus money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the work that your colleague is doing is haraam, in the \r\n    way mentioned above, it is not permissible for you to help him, either by \r\n    telling him about engineers or any other kind of help.

But if you did it voluntarily, you do not have the right to ask for \r\n    anything, but if he gives you something in this case willingly, we do not \r\n    think that you should take it, unless he has cleared the matter with the \r\n    boss and he has let him keep the money saved.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7821","question_id":"7821","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      It seems from your question that the state is only \r\n      marketing the dates grown by the people who are taking part in these \r\n      projects so as to encourage and help them, and it is not doing that for \r\n      other people.

If he dies before that, if the children agree to this gift, then it \r\n    is valid, just as if they agree to it whilst he is still alive. But if they \r\n    do not agree to it, then it should be put back with the estate and inherited \r\n    along with the rest of his wealth.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Liqaa&rsquo;aat \r\n    al-Baab il-Maftooh<\/span><\/i><span> \r\n    (39.question no. 1).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And he (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning a case where one of a person&rsquo;s \r\n    sons needed a car:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He may buy a \r\n    car for the son to use, but it should remain the property of the father, \r\n    because the son only needs to use it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>See also <i>\r\n    Liqaa&rsquo;aat al-Baab il-Maftooh<\/i> (73\/question no. 27)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The parents \r\n    must also be fair with regard to the kind of spending that is done for a \r\n    reason, if that reason arises again with other children. So if he arranges a \r\n    marriage for one of his sons, he must also arrange marriages for his other \r\n    children if they need to get married and the parents can afford to get them \r\n    married. It is not essential that they spend the same amount on the \r\n    weddings. The marriage of one of them may not cost the same as the marriage \r\n    of another. So it is not permissible for the parents who have arranged a \r\n    marriage for one of their children to give a similar amount of money to the \r\n    rest of their children, and after the father dies it is not permissible to \r\n    take this money from the estate and give it to the children who did not get \r\n    married whilst their father was still alive, unless the other heirs agree to \r\n    that.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>What we have \r\n    said about marriage applies also to medical treatment, education and so on.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The basic \r\n    principle is that it is not permissible for the father to give anything to \r\n    any of his sons or daughters unless he gives something similar to the \r\n    others, because Basheer ibn Sa&rsquo;d al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    gave his son al-Nu&rsquo;maan ibn Basheer a gift, and he came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ask him to bear witness to \r\n    the gift that he gave to his son. He said to him: &ldquo;Do you have other sons?&rdquo; \r\n    He said: Yes. He said: &ldquo;Have you given them a similar gift?&rdquo; He said: No. \r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fear \r\n    Allaah and treat your children fairly.&rdquo; And he also said: &ldquo;Let someone else \r\n    bear witness to this, for I will not bear witness to injustice.&rdquo; So it is \r\n    not permissible for the father to single out one of his children, whether \r\n    sons or daughters, for something unless he gives something similar to the \r\n    others, or if they agree to that willingly and by their own choice, and they \r\n    are mature and of sound mind. In that case there is nothing wrong with it. \r\n    Otherwise, if the gift is to meet some need of maintenance or a need for \r\n    marriage, such as if one of them is independent of means and does not need \r\n    his father to spend on him, but another is poor and needs his father to \r\n    spend on him, and he spends on this poor one as much as is needed, then that \r\n    is permissible, even if he does not give anything to the other one who is \r\n    independent of means. Similarly, if one of his sons needs to get married and \r\n    he arranges his marriage, then he does not have to give the others the same \r\n    as he gives to this son for his marriage, but when the others reach the age \r\n    of marriage and want to get married, he has to arrange their marriages as he \r\n    did for the first one.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>I would like \r\n    to take this opportunity to speak of something that some people do, which is \r\n    when a man has children who have reached the age of marriage, he arranges \r\n    their marriages, and he has other children who are still small and have not \r\n    yet reached the age of marriage. So he leaves a will leaving them after his \r\n    death the same amount as he gave to their brothers. This bequest is haraam \r\n    and is invalid, because the reason for arranging the marriages of the older \r\n    ones was to meet a need, and the younger ones had not yet reached an age \r\n    where they needed to get married. If he leaves a will giving them something \r\n    like that which he spent to marry off the others, that is haraam and is \r\n    invalid, and the will should not be executed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Liqaa&rsquo;aat \r\n    al-Baab il-Mahtooh<\/span><\/i><span> \r\n    (39\/question no. 1)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And he said \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him):&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If a man \r\n    arranges marriages for his adult sons it is not permissible for him to \r\n    bequeath the mahr to his younger sons, but when one of his sons reaches the \r\n    age of marriage he must arrange his marriage as he did for the first one. \r\n    But if he bequeaths it to him after he dies, this is haraam. The evidence \r\n    for that is the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him): &ldquo;Allaah has given each person his rights and no will can be made \r\n    in favour of an heir.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Majmoo&rsquo; \r\n    Fataawa al-Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/span><\/i><span> \r\n    (18\/question no. 296).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Based on this, \r\n    what the mother says about delaying the division of the estate until the \r\n    rest of her children are married and have finished their studies is wrong \r\n    and it is not permissible for her to do it or for her children to accept \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Sixthly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The children \r\n    do not have to make their mother their agent in the disposal of the estate \r\n    because she owns nothing but her own share.

Preventing the wrongdoer from \r\n    being able to do harm is a fard kifaayah (communal obligation). If there is \r\n    no one who can do that in an official capacity or who is stronger than him \r\n    and can stop the wrongdoers and sinners and deter them from their wrongdoing \r\n    and crimes, then it becomes an individual responsibility, depending on one&rsquo;s \r\n    strength and ability, to be done with kindness and gentleness, and one will \r\n    be rewarded for that in sha Allaah.

Qisaas \r\n    can only be by retaliating in like manner, hence it is not required in the \r\n    case of wounding or cutting, unless it is possible to do the same things. \r\n    When it is not possible to retaliate in kind with regard to wounding or \r\n    cutting, then we have to resort to the diyah idea, and the same applies to \r\n    slapping and the like, where we have to resort to ta&rsquo;zeer if retaliating in \r\n    like manner is not possible. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who say that qisaas is permissible say: Qisaas in such \r\n    cases is closer to Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and qiyaas (analogy) and justice than \r\n    ta&rsquo;zeer. As for Qur&rsquo;aan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp; <i>\r\n    &ldquo;The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof&rdquo; [al-Shoora 42:40]<\/i> \r\n    and <i>&ldquo;Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you \r\n    transgress likewise against him&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:194]<\/i>. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is well-known that responding in kind is required \r\n    according as much as possible, so a slap is more similar to a slap than \r\n    ta&rsquo;zeer, and a blow is more similar to a blow than ta&rsquo;zeer, because the \r\n    ta&rsquo;zeer may be a blow in a different place, that does not resemble the \r\n    original blow in type or location, or extent. So you are trying to avoid the \r\n    unavoidable difference between two slaps and you ended up with a greater \r\n    difference (by choosing ta&rsquo;zeer) without any evidence from texts or analogy. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: As for the Sunnah [Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) quoted a number of ahaadeeth which prove that qisaas is \r\n    allowed in such cases]. Then he said: If there was no evidence concerning \r\n    this matter except the practice of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, that would be \r\n    sufficient evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim &lsquo;ala Tahdheeb Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i> \r\n    (7\/336, 337).

Or you may \r\n    retaliate (qisaas) by doing the same as was done to you without overstepping \r\n    the mark or wronging him. Or you may forego your right to qisaas in return \r\n    for some material compensation as determined by the shar&rsquo;i judge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you take retaliation by doing to him the same as he did to \r\n    you, then it is not permissible for you to take any money in return for the \r\n    humiliation, because you have taken your right. By the same token, any \r\n    compensation that is awarded to you is in return for the beating, not the \r\n    humiliation, because humiliation is an intangible harm, and it is not \r\n    permissible to take material compensation for this kind of harm. The \r\n    majority of scholars are agreed on this point.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in a report of the Islamic Fiqh Council (no. 109 \r\n    (3\/12):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The kind of harm for which it is permissible to receive \r\n    compensation is actual material harm &hellip; it does not include intangible harm. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (13\/40), under \r\n    the heading &ldquo;Compensation for intangible harm&rdquo;:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have not found any of the fuqaha&rsquo; who discussed this, \r\n    rather it is a modern idea. We do not find in the books of fiqh any faqeeh \r\n    who spoke of financial compensation for any kind of intangible harm. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In conclusion: What you are entitled to is qisaas, or letting \r\n    him off completely &ndash; which is the best choice if it seems that he has mended \r\n    his ways or regretted it &ndash; or accepting compensation in return for having \r\n    been beaten. If you avail yourself of the right to qisaas, then you have no \r\n    right after that to any money. But if you are going to take your rights in \r\n    the form of money only &ndash; which is what seems to be the case from your \r\n    question &ndash; then there is nothing wrong with you making use of it for \r\n    yourself or giving it in charity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7841","question_id":"7841","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    So long as the phone company has not announced the additional \r\n    amount and it is added to the card, then what has happened is the result of \r\n    some mistake, and the one who has discovered this has to inform the company \r\n    so that they can correct it.

With the second type of \r\n    certificate they go further, because they take the total amount of riba and \r\n    divide it into unequal amounts, and give them to the lowest number of \r\n    depositors, then they distribute these amounts in the form of prizes which \r\n    are awarded by drawing lots. So you may find a person who has deposited a \r\n    small amount being given thousands of pounds, whereas one who has deposited \r\n    thousands does not get anything.&nbsp; So the former takes his share of the riba \r\n    along with the shares of many others, and the latter loses his share to \r\n    someone else. Every time the riba is shared out it is watched keenly, and \r\n    one emerges happy with what he has gained whilst another grieves over what \r\n    he has lost, and he looks forward to another opportunity. Is this not \r\n    gambling? The riba-based banks have resorted to gambling with riba! The one \r\n    who does not win his share of riba the first two times gambles with his \r\n    share the third time. Isn&rsquo;t the third type worse than the first two? End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars \r\n    of the Standing Committee were asked: Some commercial banks offer prizes \r\n    such as cars or houses for people who open deposit accounts in the bank to \r\n    keep their money safe. They draw lots among the customers of the bank, then \r\n    one of the customers wins the prize. What is the ruling on this prize, \r\n    whether it is in the form of cash or a gift?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They \r\n    replied: If the matter is as described, then these prizes are not \r\n    permissible, because they are interest that is given in return for \r\n    depositing money in the riba-based bank. Changing the names does not alter \r\n    reality.

The scholars are unanimously \r\n    agreed that every loan that brings a benefit is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (6\/436):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Every loan \r\n    in which it is stipulated that more be given back is haraam, and there is no \r\n    difference of opinion on this matter. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They are \r\n    unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must give \r\n    more back or give him a gift, and he lends it to him on that basis, taking \r\n    the extra payment is riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood that they forbade loans that bring benefits.

Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: He said that it is not permissible to \r\n    sell spring water, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;The Muslims are partners in three things: water, pasture \r\n    and fire,&rdquo; and because this water was not extracted by any human effort, \r\n    rather it came out by the power of Allaah. A man may dig a deep well and \r\n    find that no water comes out, so this water is not the result of his efforts \r\n    or actions, rather he is only a cause. So he cannot take possession of it, \r\n    and if he cannot take possession of it then he cannot sell it. But if he \r\n    took possession of it, took the water away and put it in a tank, then it is \r\n    permissible for him to sell it, because it became his property by means of \r\n    removing it and putting it in his tank.

The product \r\n    which the company sells to the agent is simply a screen for this \r\n    transaction; it is not what the participant is seeking and it makes no \r\n    difference to the ruling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It is a kind of gharar (ambiguous transaction) that is \r\n    forbidden in sharee&rsquo;ah, because the participant does not know whether he \r\n    will be successful in finding the number of purchasers (participants) \r\n    required or not. No matter how long pyramid or network marketing lasts, it \r\n    must inevitably reach an end, and when a person joins the pyramid he does \r\n    not know whether he will be in a higher level and thus make a profit, or in \r\n    the lower levels and thus make a loss. The fact of the matter is that most \r\n    of the members of the pyramid lose out, except for the few at the top. So \r\n    what usually happens is loss, which is the case of all ambiguous \r\n    transactions. One of two things may happen, and it is usually the one that \r\n    is most feared. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    forbade ambiguous transactions, as was narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; These transactions involve consuming people&rsquo;s wealth \r\n    unlawfully, because these contracts benefit no one but the companies and \r\n    some participants whom the company encourages with the aim of tricking \r\n    others. This is what is forbidden in the Qur&rsquo;aan, where Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Eat not up your property among \r\n    yourselves unjustly&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:29]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; This transaction \r\n    involves cheating, deceiving and tricking people, by showing the product as \r\n    if that is the purpose of this transaction, when that is not the case, and \r\n    by enticing them with the idea of large commission which people do not \r\n    usually earn. This is the kind of deceit that is forbidden in sharee&rsquo;ah. The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    deceives us is not one of us.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>. And \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The two \r\n    parties to a transaction have the choice, so long as they have not parted. \r\n    If they are sincere and open in their dealings, the transaction will be \r\n    blessed for them, but if they lie and conceal anything, the blessing of \r\n    their transaction will be erased.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the view that this transaction is a kind of \r\n    brokerage, this is not true. Brokerage is a transaction whereby the broker \r\n    receives payment in return for selling the product, whereas in network \r\n    marketing the participant pays a fee in order to market the product. \r\n    Brokerage means marketing the product in a real sense, unlike network \r\n    marketing where the real aim is to market the transaction, not the product, \r\n    so the participant markets to others who will market to others who will \r\n    market to others and so on, unlike brokerage in which the broker markets the \r\n    product to those who really want the product. The difference between the two \r\n    is quite clear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the view that the transaction is a kind of \r\n    gift, this is also not true. Even if we accept that, not every gift is \r\n    permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah. A gift given in return for a loan is \r\n    riba. Hence &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam said to Abu Burdah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them both): &ldquo;You are in a land where riba is widespread among them. If \r\n    you have some right over a man and he gives you a load of straw or a load of \r\n    barley or a load of fodder, this is riba.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his <i>\r\n    Saheeh<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Gifts are subject to the rulings on the reason for which they \r\n    are given. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said, concerning the zakaat-collector who came and said: &ldquo;This is for \r\n    you and this is what was given to me as a gift&rdquo;: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit in the \r\n    house of your father and mother and see whether you are given any gifts or \r\n    not?&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These commissions are only paid for the purpose of joining \r\n    the network marketing scheme, no matter what names are given to them, \r\n    whether they are called gifts or anything else. That does not change their \r\n    nature or the ruling on them in the slightest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is worth mentioning that there are companies that have \r\n    appeared in the market which follow the practices of network marketing or \r\n    pyramid marketing, such as &ldquo;Smartest Way&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gold Quest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seven \r\n    Diamonds&rdquo;. The ruling on these companies is no different from the ruling on \r\n    the companies mentioned above, even though the products they offer may \r\n    vary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

Some \r\n    scholars are of the view that this wealth is haraam only for the one who \r\n    earns it, but for the one who takes it from him in a permissible way, it is \r\n    not haraam for him, such as if your father gives you a gift or spends on you \r\n    and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said: Some of the scholars said that in \r\n    the case of wealth that is haraam because of the way in which it was \r\n    acquired, the sin is only on the one who earned it, not on the one who takes \r\n    it in a permissible way from the one who acquired it. This is unlike wealth \r\n    that is haraam in and of itself, such as alcohol, wealth seized by force, \r\n    and so on. This view has a strong basis, because the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) bought food from the Jews for his \r\n    family, and he ate from the lamb that the Jewish women gave him in Khaybar, \r\n    and he accepted the invitation of a Jew, even though it is well known that \r\n    most of the Jews consume riba and haraam wealth. Perhaps this view is \r\n    further supported by the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) concerning the meat that was given in charity to \r\n    Bareerah: &ldquo;It is charity for her and a gift from her to us.&rdquo; <i>Al-Qawl \r\n    al-Mufeed &lsquo;ala Kitaab al-Tawheed<\/i>, 3\/112. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said: With regard to that which is \r\n    haraam because of the way in which it is acquired, such as that which is \r\n    taken by means of deceit, or by means of riba, or by means of lying and so \r\n    on, this is haraam for the one who acquires it, but it is not haraam for \r\n    anyone else if he acquires it from him in a permissible manner. This is \r\n    indicated by the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) used to deal with the Jews even though they used to consume \r\n    haraam wealth and riba.

This falls into two categories: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; If the \r\n    reason for his demanding his right is obvious and does not require proof, \r\n    such as a woman&rsquo;s right to maintenance from her husband, or the child&rsquo;s \r\n    right to maintenance from his father, or the guest&rsquo;s right to hospitality \r\n    from the people with whom he is staying, then in this case he has the right \r\n    to take it without permission from the one who owes that to him without a \r\n    doubt. It was proven in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> that Hind bint &lsquo;Utbah ibn \r\n    Rabee&rsquo;ah said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man and he \r\n    does not give me sufficient maintenance for myself and my child.&rdquo; He said: \r\n    &ldquo;Take what is sufficient for you and your child, on a reasonable basis.&rdquo; In \r\n    this report the Prophet (S) permitted her to take her maintenance, on a \r\n    reasonable basis, without asking the permission of the owner of the money. \r\n    Similarly, if it is known that a person&rsquo;s wealth has clearly been wrongfully \r\n    seized and the people know about that, he may take the seized wealth or its \r\n    equivalent from the one who seized it, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; If the \r\n    reason for demanding his right is not obvious, such as when a person denies \r\n    that he owes him money, or denies that he seized his wealth unlawfully, and \r\n    the claimant has no proof. There are two scholarly views in this case. One \r\n    is that he should not take it; this is the view of Maalik and Ahmad. The \r\n    other is that he can take it; this is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Those who say that he \r\n    should not take it if he has no clear proof of his right quote as evidence \r\n    the report narrated in <i>al-Sunan<\/i> from Abu Hurayrah, that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Render back the \r\n    trust to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray those who betray \r\n    you.&rdquo; And in <i>al-Musnad<\/i> it is narrated that Basheer ibn al-Khasaasah \r\n    said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, we have neighbours who do not leave anything, \r\n    great or small, but they take it. If we have the opportunity to take \r\n    something from them, should we take it?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No. Render back the trust \r\n    to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray those who betray you.&rdquo; \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>These \r\n    ahaadeeth explain that if the right of the one who is wronged is not \r\n    obvious, and he takes it in a sneaky manner, he does not have the right to \r\n    do that, even if all he intends is to take something equivalent to his \r\n    right, but he does that by betraying someone who trusted him. That is \r\n    because when he entrusted him with his wealth and he took some of it without \r\n    his permission and there is no clear proof of his rights, then this is a \r\n    betrayal of trust.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>That is \r\n    because betrayal in and of itself is haraam, so it should not be used as a \r\n    means of taking one&rsquo;s rights. Betrayal is akin to lying. If it is said that \r\n    this is not a betrayal, rather it is taking one&rsquo;s rights and the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only forbade betraying the one who betrays you, in the sense of taking more from his wealth than is your right &ndash; it should be noted that this argument is weak on a number of counts, one of which is that in the hadeeth it says, &ldquo;we have neighbours who do not leave anything, great or small, but they take it. If we have the opportunity to take something from them, should we take it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;No. Render back the trust to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray those who betray you.&rdquo; &nbsp;The second is that he said: &ldquo;Do not betray those who betray you,&rdquo; i.e., you should not respond to the one who betrays you by doing the same thing to him as he did to you. The third is that this action is undoubtedly a betrayal. Rather those who allowed it did so as a retaliatory measure, because there are cases in which retaliation is allowed, such as murder, banditry and seizing wealth unlawfully. And there are some cases in which retaliation is not allowed, such as immoral actions, lying, etc. When he said here, &ldquo;Do not betray those who betray you,&rdquo; it is known that this is a case in which it is not permitted to punish in like manner.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"7867","question_id":"7867","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Participating in pension plans other than those organized by the government is a \r\n    kind of gambling, because a person may contribute to the scheme for a number of months, then become disabled or die, so he and his heirs may get \r\n    much more money than was taken from them, or he may pay many installments then what he takes from them is less than what he paid.

If in the majority of cases a thing is used for \r\n    haraam purposes, then it is haraam to sell it. For example, it is haraam to \r\n    sell pork, alcohol and dead meat even though they may &ndash; on rare occasions &ndash; \r\n    be used for a permissible purpose, such as eating dead meat for those who \r\n    are in extreme need, or using alcohol to stop oneself choking or to putt out \r\n    a fire, or using pig hairs for beading, or making use of the hair and skin \r\n    of a pig &ndash; according to those who approve of that.&nbsp; But because these are \r\n    not the reason for which these things are produced, and the usual use for \r\n    pigs and dead meat is to eat them, and the usual use for alcohol is to drink \r\n    it, so no attention should be paid to these reasons, and it is haraam to \r\n    sell these things. <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    indicated this when it was said to him: &ldquo;What do you think of the fat of \r\n    dead animals, for ships are caulked with it and animal skins are daubed with \r\n    it, and the people use it to light their lamps?&rdquo; &nbsp;He said: &ldquo;No, it is \r\n    haraam.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Jaami&rsquo; al-&lsquo;Uloom wa&rsquo;l-Hukam<\/i>, \r\n    1\/415, 416<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Standing \r\n    Committee was asked: Is it permissible to deal in alcohol and pork if one is \r\n    not selling them to a Muslim?

The general \r\n    meaning of the evidence indicates that it is haraam to sell it to Muslims \r\n    and kaafirs alike, because the evidence indicates that the prohibition on \r\n    selling it is general in application, and no differentiation is made between \r\n    Muslims and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Indeed, if we were to say that what is meant by the \r\n    prohibition on selling it is selling it to kaafirs, that would not be \r\n    far-fetched, because the basic assumption concerning the Muslim is that he \r\n    would never buy pork: what would he do with it when he knows that Allaah has \r\n    forbidden it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, the questioner&rsquo;s saying that &ldquo;pork existed at the \r\n    time of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and \r\n    if he had wanted to forbid it and curse it he would have done so as he did \r\n    with alcohol&rdquo; is also not correct, because it is not essential for a thing \r\n    to be forbidden that the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) should have cursed the one who does it. Rather it is sufficient \r\n    that he forbade it or stated that it is haraam, as he forbade the sale of \r\n    pork.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to your taking this money, now that you know that \r\n    it is haraam, it is more befiiting for you to refuse to take it, especially \r\n    since your taking it is like giving approval to what the company owner is \r\n    doing. You have to advise him, denounce what he is doing and exhort him to \r\n    give up these haraam actions.

No one gains money from this scheme except the ones \r\n    who set it up and a small number of those who join it; most of them come out \r\n    with nothing but sin and regret.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence in some western countries such schemes are known as \r\n    pyramids of illusion or selling air.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Dr Waa&rsquo;il Ghunaym, the head of marketing in an e-mail company \r\n    says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This idea is based on a principle that is akin to gambling, \r\n    whereby each person puts his money on the table then the one who is the most \r\n    eloquent and persuasive takes it all.&nbsp; Joining the scheme earlier also plays \r\n    a role in acquiring the thousands upon thousands, because the one who starts \r\n    it and those who follow him, up to a certain level of the pyramid &ndash; which \r\n    varies according to how big the company grows and how many levels there are \r\n    in the pyramid &ndash; are the ones who will earn the large amounts of money. They \r\n    are like the gamblers who win big. Their intelligence plays no role in their \r\n    huge earnings, all that they do is to convince a number of people to join \r\n    and they sit and watch what their followers will do and so on. It remains \r\n    that the first one is better off, and the pyramid has different levels, as \r\n    follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The kings of the pyramids of illusion. They are the ones \r\n    who will earn huge amounts because they joined it first and their numbers \r\n    are few&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; The dealers of the pyramids of illusion. They are the \r\n    ones who will earn something but it will be a very ordinary amount and not \r\n    that on which they pinned their hopes. Their number is also few.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Those who escape unscathed from the pyramids of illusion. \r\n    They are the ones who will neither win nor lose, but they managed to get \r\n    back the money that they paid in. Their number is moderate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; The victims of the pyramid, who are more than 80 % of \r\n    those who join the scheme. Their number is greater the more levels there are \r\n    in the pyramid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The number of those who are able to convince others to join \r\n    becomes greater the more levels the pyramid acquires. This clearly shows us \r\n    that the greater earnings can only come when more losers join the scheme, \r\n    because the company will make profits, and the kings and dealers will make a \r\n    profit, and this mathematical equation can only be achieved at the expense \r\n    of victims of the illusion, who donated their wealth to the kings and \r\n    dealers of the pyramid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On January 5, 2000 the department of consumer protection in \r\n    one of the states of the US issued a warning about a club that was using its \r\n    membership cards as a means to propagate these pyramids of illusion. The \r\n    Trade Department in that state had already warned about these pyramid \r\n    schemes and described them as follows: they promise a quick and certain \r\n    profit, and they tell everyone of how successful this idea has been for some \r\n    workers who joined the scheme. They are based on face-to-face meetings in \r\n    which they use psychological pressure so that a person does not think and \r\n    signs up as soon as the presentation ends. The Department stated that these \r\n    pyramid schemes are based on lies and that very few of those who join will \r\n    make any gains.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Canadian government added a clause to its Criminal Code \r\n    expressly forbidding any individual or organization to operate pyramid \r\n    schemes. The government described these schemes as a program in which a \r\n    person pays a sum of money to join the group, in return for attending \r\n    lectures or getting some educational material on this subject, then he is \r\n    required to try to persuade a certain number of people to do the same. The \r\n    Canadian police website states that millions of dollars were collected from \r\n    people who joined the scheme and lost their money, whilst a very small \r\n    number of people acquired a huge amount of money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Robert Carols, author of <i>False Profits<\/i>, published a \r\n    detailed analysis which proves to all that these pyramid schemes are no more \r\n    than a fraud that is based on a large number of participants, in which only \r\n    the people at the top of the pyramid gain anything; they are usually the \r\n    owner of the company and the original members with him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Standing Committee \r\n    has been asked about various forms of such schemes, and they have stated \r\n    that they are all haraam and that they are kinds of riba and gambling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (15\/212): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the matter is as described, then this scheme is a kind of \r\n    gambling that Allaah has forbidden in the verse (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

But the behaviour of the one who goes to these places should be \r\n    free of any cheating or deceit, so you should not act as if you are going in \r\n    to eat; rather you should ask permission from the manager to go into the \r\n    washroom, then if he gives you permission you may go, otherwise you should \r\n    leave. If permission is given to go in, it is permissible to use the soap \r\n    and towels and hand dryers, because that is part of the whole thing, but if \r\n    you refrain from using these things, that is better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is known that the owner of the restaurant does not like \r\n    that but is forced to give permission because of shyness or embarrassment, \r\n    it is not permissible to go in except in cases of necessity, because that \r\n    which is taken by means of embarrassment is not permissible. The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It is not permissible to \r\n    take a man's wealth except if he gives it willingly.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, \r\n    20172; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, no. \r\n    7662.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For the prohibition on that which is taken by means of \r\n    embarrassment, see: <i>Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj<\/i>, 6\/317.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In cases of necessity, you may go in. The fuqaha&rsquo; have stated \r\n    the situations in which it is permissible to take the food and water of \r\n    another person without his permission for fear of dying, then the price of \r\n    it should be given to him in compensation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (9\/335): In the case of \r\n    necessity, when there is no other food, it depends. If a person is in urgent \r\n    need of food and he could find food only with someone else, then we examine \r\n    the situation. If the one who owns the food is in urgent need of that food, \r\n    then he is more entitled to it and no one else has the right to take it away \r\n    from him, because they are both in equal need of the food, but one owns it. \r\n    Therefore this is like the case in which someone takes the food of another \r\n    without any urgent need. If anyone takes the food from him and he dies, then \r\n    he is liable for his death, because he killed him unlawfully. But if the \r\n    owner of the food is not in urgent need of it, then he has to give it to the \r\n    one who is in urgent need of it so as to preserve the life of a human being \r\n    which is protected by sharee&rsquo;ah. Therefore he has to give the food to him, \r\n    as he would have to do whatever he can to save him from drowning or burning. \r\n    If he does not do that, then the one who is in urgent need of the food has \r\n    the right to take it from him because he is more entitled to it than the one \r\n    who owns it, so it is permissible for him to take it from him. If he needs \r\n    to fight in order to do that then he may fight for it, and if the one who is \r\n    in need is killed then he is a martyr and the one who killed him is liable. \r\n    If that fighting leads to the owner of the food being killed, then there is \r\n    no retaliation or compensation, because he did wrong by fighting him. That \r\n    is similar to the case of one who defends himself against an aggressor. But \r\n    if it is possible to take it by buying it or asking for it, then he does not \r\n    have the right to fight for it, because it is possible to acquire it without \r\n    doing that.

In principle, whatever a man has is his, so if one does not know \r\n    whether the item he is buying is from the halaal or haraam portion of his \r\n    wealth, then we regard it as makrooh, because of the possibility that it may \r\n    be haraam, but the transaction is not regarded as invalid, because of the \r\n    possibility that it may be halaal, whether the haraam portion is great or \r\n    small. This is the cause of the doubt concerning the ruling, and this doubt \r\n    is commensurate with the portion of haraam involved; the greater or lesser \r\n    the portion of haraam, the greater or lesser the doubt is.

To the seller we \r\n    say: did you raise the price because of this prize or not? If you raised the \r\n    price, then this is not permissible, because if the price was raised and the \r\n    people bought from him, then they will be either winners or losers. If the \r\n    market price for this item is ten, for example, but you made it twelve \r\n    because of the price, then this is not permissible, because the one who \r\n    bought it for twelve will either lose the extra money that he paid, that was \r\n    more than ten, or he will gain more than that amount in the prize. So this \r\n    falls under the heading of gambling, which is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the seller says: I am \r\n    selling it at the price that people usually pay, no more and no less, then \r\n    he may offer those prizes so as to encourage people to buy from him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Then we turn to the \r\n    purchaser and say: Did you buy this item because you needed it, and would \r\n    you have bought it whether there was a prize or not, or did you buy it only \r\n    because of the prize? If he says the former, then we say there is nothing \r\n    wrong with buying it from this vendor or that, because so long as the price \r\n    is still the market price, and you are going to buy this item because you \r\n    need it, then in that case you will either be a winner or be safe. In that \r\n    case there is nothing wrong with buying it from the one who is offering \r\n    prizes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if he says, I bought it \r\n    although I do not want the item; I only bought it so that I could get the \r\n    prize, we say that this comes under the heading of wasting money, because \r\n    you do not know whether you will get the prize or not. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I have heard that some \r\n    people will buy a carton of milk which they do not want; they buy it and \r\n    pour it away in the hope of wining the prize. This is wasting money, and it \r\n    is proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    forbade wasting money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There remains a third \r\n    matter, which is that someone may say that this transaction may harm other \r\n    sellers, because if this seller offers prizes to purchasers, and his prices \r\n    are like the market prices, all people will go to him and the sales of other \r\n    traders will become stagnant, so this will harm others. We say: This matter \r\n    should be referred to the state, which should intervene. If the state thinks \r\n    that this matter will affect the market, then it should ban it if it thinks \r\n    that banning it will be in the people&rsquo;s interests, or if it thinks that it \r\n    is tinkering with the markets, because tinkering with the markets is \r\n    something that the authorities should prevent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote from <i>Liqaa&rsquo;aat \r\n    al-Baab il-Maftooh<\/i> (49\/question no. 5)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It makes no difference \r\n    whether the prizes are offered to the one who wins the draw or to all \r\n    purchasers, or whether they are the same or differ according to the draw or \r\n    how a person plays the game, as you mention.

There are some people who deal with cars who have little faith and do not fear Allaah, and when their cars are insured they do not \r\n    care what happens, so they expose themselves to danger and drive recklessly, so they may cause accidents and kill believing souls and destroy \r\n    wealth that is protected in sharee&rsquo;ah, and they do not care about that because they know that the insurance company will bear the resulting costs. \r\n    I say that this insurance is not permissible because of these reasons and others, whether that is car insurance, life insurance, property \r\n    insurance etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, \r\n    3\/5&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If this is the ruling on insurance, then \r\n    buying shares in these companies is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence the scholars of the Standing Committee \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not permissible to buy shares in \r\n    commercial insurance companies, because insurance policies include ambiguity and riba, which are forbidden in Islamic sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>. \r\n    2\/43&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on this, the profits earned through shares in insurance companies are also haraam.

That is because commercial \r\n    insurance involves elements of ambiguity, gambling and consuming wealth \r\n    unlawfully, unlike cooperative insurance which is based on takaaful and \r\n    tadaamun (mutual support and solidarity). The one who looks objectively at \r\n    the insurance industry nowadays will realize that this is a moderate and \r\n    fair-minded approach, and will understand the extent to which it is in \r\n    accordance with the aims of Islamic sharee&rsquo;ah of achieving the people&rsquo;s \r\n    interests and meeting their needs without being unjust or causing them any \r\n    harm. Studies of the insurance industry bear witness to that. In a \r\n    commercial insurance organization, huge amounts of wealth are accumulated by \r\n    the insurance companies in return for some compensation which may be \r\n    regarded as very little in comparison to the profits that they make. The \r\n    result is that only a few rich people benefit the most from the advantages \r\n    of insurance and its services, whilst the vast majority of poor people are \r\n    deprived of it because they are unable to afford insurance payments. These \r\n    companies make people feel that there is no way to spread risk except in \r\n    this manner. This is something which has been proven false by the experience \r\n    of cooperative insurance schemes which have been set up in some advanced \r\n    countries, where it has been more successful in achieving the aims of \r\n    insurance than the commercial insurance companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>2 &ndash; The difference between commercial insurance and \r\n    cooperative insurance <\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of commercial insurance, the administration of \r\n    the insurance is carried out by a company which has an identity separate \r\n    from that of those who are insured by it. This company is entitled to all \r\n    the instalments paid in return for its commitment to pay out insurance money \r\n    when it is due (i.e., when an accident or whatever happens). What is left of \r\n    these instalments is not paid back to those who are insured by the company, \r\n    because it is considered to be a payment in return for the company&rsquo;s \r\n    commitment to pay the compensation as agreed. If all the instalments \r\n    collected by the company are not enough to pay all the compensation, then \r\n    the company has no right to go back to the customers and ask them to pay \r\n    more. This is the essence of the kind of ambiguous transaction that is \r\n    forbidden in Islam, and is consuming wealth unlawfully.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of cooperative insurance, a number of people who \r\n    are exposed to the same type of danger get together and each of them pays a \r\n    specific contribution. These contributions are for the purpose of paying \r\n    compensation to anyone who becomes entitled to it as the result of some harm \r\n    that befell him. If the sum of contributions is greater than the sum paid \r\n    out in compensation, the members of the scheme are entitled to take back the \r\n    difference. If there is a shortfall, then the members are asked to make \r\n    additional contributions to cover the deficit, or else the compensation paid \r\n    is reduced in accordance with that deficit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It does not matter if the cooperative insurance scheme is run \r\n    by some entity that is separate from those who are covered by the scheme, or \r\n    that entity takes wages or commission in return for running the scheme. It \r\n    also does not matter if it takes part of the profits earned by investing \r\n    that money, in return for acting as their investment agent. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it is clear that both types of insurance companies may \r\n    be a separate entity independent of those who are covered by the insurance. \r\n    In both cases it may be a profitable company &ndash; i.e., one which aims to make \r\n    a profit. The difference between the two types is clear in two basic \r\n    matters:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>The first difference<\/i>: in the \r\n    case of commercial insurance, there is a contractual commitment between the \r\n    insurance company and those who are covered by it, whereby the company is \r\n    obliged to pay compensation to the customers, in return for which the \r\n    company is entitled to all the instalments paid. In the case of cooperative \r\n    insurance, there is no room for this commitment, because compensation is to \r\n    be paid from whatever is available of instalments paid. If the instalments \r\n    are not enough to cover all the compensation, then the members are asked to \r\n    increase their contributions in order to make up the difference, otherwise \r\n    compensation will be paid in part, depending on what funds are available.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>The second difference<\/i>: the \r\n    cooperative insurance company does not aim to make a profit from the \r\n    difference between the instalments paid by its customers and the \r\n    compensation for harm that is paid to them by the company. Rather if the sum \r\n    of instalments is greater than the sum paid out in compensation for damages, \r\n    the extra amount is returned to the customers. In contrast, any extra funds \r\n    in the case of commercial insurance belong entirely to the insurance company \r\n    in return for its commitment to compensate its customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>3 &ndash; Ruling on joining cooperative insurance schemes<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From studying the financial statements of the National \r\n    Cooperative Insurance Company (<i>al-Sharikah al-Wataniyyah li&rsquo;l-Ta&rsquo;meen \r\n    al-Ta&rsquo;aawuni<\/i>) over the past five years, it is clear that it is not \r\n    permissible to join this company for the following reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: The insurance contract with this company is for \r\n    commercial insurance, not cooperative. Even though the company was \r\n    established by separating the fund for instalments paid by shareholders from \r\n    the financial activities of the insurance company (which has to do \r\n    administering the funds paid by members of the insurance scheme) &ndash; as is the \r\n    case with cooperative insurance &ndash; the system of insurance practised by this \r\n    company is nothing more or less than commercial insurance, contrary to what \r\n    its name may indicate. This is clear from the following points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The basic system of the company \r\n    states that if there is any surplus money which represents the difference \r\n    between instalments paid in and money paid out in compensation, 10% of it is \r\n    to paid out to those who are covered by the insurance, and the remainder, \r\n    which is 90% of the net surplus, is to be paid out to the shareholders, \r\n    because they have taken a risk by investing in this insurance. (Article 43 \r\n    of the constitution of the company; article 70 of the executive regulations \r\n    of the watchdog committee on cooperative insurance companies). This means \r\n    that the insurance system in this company is based on a contractual \r\n    commitment, whereby the shareholders are entitled to the instalments in \r\n    return for their commitment to pay compensation. This is the true nature of \r\n    commercial insurance. Giving back a part of the surplus to the customers is \r\n    no more than an attempt to give an air of shar&rsquo;i legitimacy to the contract. \r\n    But in cooperative insurance, the entire surplus must be given to the \r\n    customers, either being paid out to them or placed in a contingency fund.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>As a result of this rule, the \r\n    company had surplus funds from its insurance activities, which in 2003 was \r\n    178,914,000 riyals, of which 18,000,000 was returned to its customers, i.e., \r\n    10% of the surplus. The remaining amount, after taking out some for the \r\n    contingency fund, was added to the accumulated funds of the company that it \r\n    has acquired from its insurance activities, the total of which is \r\n    548,452,000 riyals. According to the rules of the company, this surplus is \r\n    regarded as belonging to the shareholders.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>This company has contracts for \r\n    reinsurance with companies that offer this service, which are usually \r\n    foreign companies that deal on the basis of commercial insurance.

This is the \r\n    nature of commercial insurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: The company invests in some haraam activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The company has invested the money paid by its customers in \r\n    haraam stocks and bonds, the value of which in 2003 was 430,525,000 riyals, \r\n    which is equivalent to 24% of the total insurance activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The company also invested the shareholders&rsquo; money in haraam \r\n    stocks and bonds, the value of which in 2003 reached 34,981,000 riyals, or \r\n    8% of the total of the shareholders&rsquo; rights. In addition to that, the \r\n    company owns 50% of one of the commercial insurance companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Suggestions for a \r\n    cooperative insurance scheme that is in accordance with shar&rsquo;i guidelines \r\n    and achieves the aims of insurance:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The administration of the \r\n    cooperative insurance should be done by a shared-based company, where the \r\n    shareholders&rsquo; financial affairs are truly independent of the insurance \r\n    operation. <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The share-based company should \r\n    be allowed to deduct all the administrative and running costs from the total \r\n    amount of insurance payments collected, and charge fees in return for \r\n    running the insurance operation as a paid agent. It should also be allowed \r\n    to invest the money collected from its customers for insurance in \r\n    permissible investments, for which it will be entitled to a percentage of \r\n    the profits from those investments because it is acting as an investment \r\n    partner.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The company should avoid \r\n    entering into haraam investments such as stocks and bonds, etc., whether \r\n    that is investing solely for the shareholders or investments that have to do \r\n    with the insurance operation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The company&rsquo;s obligation to pay \r\n    compensation is of two types: permissible and impermissible. The permissible \r\n    type means that the company is committed to running its business in an \r\n    honest and professional manner; if it falls short in that, it should bear \r\n    responsibility for the consequences and offer compensation for that. As for \r\n    the type that is impermissible, that means giving an absolute commitment to \r\n    offer compensation whether the harm is done by the company or by someone \r\n    else. This goes against the basic principle of cooperative insurance. \r\n    Instead of that, the company should set up a contingency fund with the money \r\n    that it has accumulated from insurance payments, and this contingency fund \r\n    should not be recorded as belonging to the shareholders, rather it belongs \r\n    exclusively to the insurance operation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The company may make insurance \r\n    contracts conditional upon spreading risk, subject to the condition that \r\n    these contracts are of the cooperative insurance type.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In conclusion, we ask Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, \r\n    to enable those who are in charge of this company to do all that is good, \r\n    and to guide us and them, and all the Muslims, to that which He loves and \r\n    which pleases Him.

The fatwas \r\n    of the majority of scholars in fiqh councils and fatwa organizations forbid \r\n    commercial insurance as it exists today in most countries of the world, if \r\n    it is optional and no one is obliged to purchase it. But if it is compulsory \r\n    insurance and one has no choice, then it is permissible to take out car \r\n    insurance, for example, and the sin is on those who forced others to do it, \r\n    based on the principle of &ldquo;necessities which make forbidden things \r\n    permissible&rdquo;. But the person who is forced to take out car insurance, for \r\n    example, should not take more than he paid, if the company compensates him \r\n    for harm suffered, based on the principle of &ldquo;necessity should be properly \r\n    estimated (without exaggeration)&rdquo;. The Muslim should strive for the sake of \r\n    his religious commitment and honour, and keep away from haraam things or \r\n    that which may be haraam, as mentioned in the hadeeth narrated by al-Nu&rsquo;maan \r\n    ibn Basheer: &ldquo;That which is halaal is clear and that which is haraam is \r\n    clear, and between them are doubtful matters which many people do not \r\n    understand. Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his \r\n    religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from \r\n    slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that \r\n    which is haraam &hellip;&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2051) and Muslim (1599).

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the fatwas of \r\n    scholars on the ruling on car insurance are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash;Fatwa by Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), when he was asked: Recently there \r\n    has appeared that which is known as insurance, for wealth, business and \r\n    cars, and there are now companies which deal with this and insure cars in \r\n    the sense that if the car is in an accident they will pay for its value and \r\n    if people are killed as a result of the accident they will pay the diyah \r\n    (blood money). What is your view, seeing that they describe the insurance as \r\n    a kind of cooperation? What is your opinion, may Allaah reward you with \r\n    good?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: According to \r\n    what you have mentioned, we think that this is haraam, i.e., for the car \r\n    owner to pay money each month or each year to this company, and the company \r\n    will pay up if an accident happens with this car. We think that this is \r\n    haraam, and that it is a kind of gambling, which Allaah mentions alongside \r\n    worshipping idols and drinking alcohol. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O you who believe! \r\n    Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al&#8209;Ansaab \r\n    (stone altars for sacrifices to idols etc) and Al&#8209;Azlaam (arrows for seeking \r\n    luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan&rsquo;s (Satan&rsquo;s) handiwork. So \r\n    avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Maa'idah 5:90]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason is that if this \r\n    policy-holder pays five hundred riyals per month, then he will pay six \r\n    thousand riyals per year, and perhaps he will have an accident in this year \r\n    which incurs costs of twenty thousand riyals, or perhaps he will have no \r\n    accident. If the former happens, i.e., an accident which incurs costs of \r\n    twenty thousand riyals, then the policy holder who paid insurance will be a \r\n    winner and the company will be a loser. But if the opposite happens and no \r\n    accident takes place during the year, then the company will be the winner \r\n    and the policy holder will be the loser. This is the essence of gambling, so \r\n    it is haraam and it is not permissible for a person to get involved in it. \r\n    Do not be deceived by what people do because Allaah, may He be blessed and \r\n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And if you obey most of \r\n    those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allaah&rsquo;s path&rdquo; \r\n    [al-An&rsquo;aam 6:116]<\/i>. My advice to my brothers is to boycott this \r\n    insurance. As for their saying that it is a kind of cooperation, this is as \r\n    false as it can be. Can anyone who does not get involved in this insurance \r\n    benefit from this organization? No he cannot, rather it is insurance which \r\n    involves gambling.

Are such transactions \r\n    permissible or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: It is not \r\n    permissible to insure cars or anything else because it is a risk and it is \r\n    consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully. What people must do is put their trust \r\n    in Allaah and if anything happens to a person by the will and decree of \r\n    Allaah then he should be patient and pay the costs and penalties that result \r\n    from that from his own wealth, not from the wealth of the insurance company. \r\n    Allaah is the One Who will help him with these things and others, so he \r\n    should not resort to insurance companies and what they involve of \r\n    risk-taking and consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully. Moreover, when car \r\n    owners insure their cars and know that the company will pay the penalty, \r\n    this makes them careless when driving and so they may cause harm to people \r\n    and their property, unlike the case if they know that they will bear the \r\n    costs and they will be responsible, in which case they will be more \r\n    cautious.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We said that insurance is \r\n    consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully, because the penalty that is paid by \r\n    the company may be many times greater than the payments made by the policy \r\n    holder, so he is consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully. Or the policy holder \r\n    may not be involved in any accident, in which case the company is consuming \r\n    his wealth unlawfully.

But if these commodities differ, then sell as you like, \r\n    as long as it is hand to hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth indicates that if a person sells gold for gold, \r\n    it must be equal amounts and the exchange completed in the same sitting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it should be sold gram for gram, with nothing added, and \r\n    the exchange must be completed in the same sitting. It is not permissible \r\n    for the two parties to separate without each of them having taken what is \r\n    due to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person sells gold for gold with a difference in the \r\n    amount, then they have fallen into riba al-fadl.

This was stated by Abu Hayyaan in his \r\n    commentary on this verse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by insurance involving consuming people's \r\n    wealth unlawfully is if the money paid by the insurance to the person who is \r\n    insured is more than he paid -- such as if the risk occurs after paying just \r\n    one instalment -- then on what basis is he entitled to this money? And if \r\n    the risk does not occur, then on what basis is the insurance company \r\n    entitled to the payments made by the person who was insured without anything \r\n    in return?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Statistics by a German expert have proven that the ratio of \r\n    payments made by insurance companies in compensation to individuals is \r\n    equivalent to no more than 2.9% of the total amount of payments made.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On what basis is the insurance company entitled this money, \r\n    and in return for what?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Insurance contracts make \r\n    obligatory things that are not obligatory according to sharee&rsquo;ah<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Insurance contracts oblige the insurance company to pay \r\n    compensation, if the risk against which insurance was taken happens. On what \r\n    basis is this made binding? The insurance company did not cause the danger \r\n    or make it happen; it did not commit any acts of aggression or shortcoming, \r\n    so how can it be forced to pay compensation for something for which it is \r\n    not liable according to sharee&rsquo;ah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Insurance harms both \r\n    individuals and society<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In addition to what is mentioned above, insurance is not free \r\n    of other harmful effects, among the most important of which are the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Taking things lightly: it makes the people insured careless \r\n    about protecting their property against calamity; they may even go further \r\n    than that and cause accidents or make accidents worse. This causes a great \r\n    deal of harm to individuals. For example, some drivers whose lives and cars \r\n    are insured may become careless and not pay heed to traffic laws and \r\n    regulations, which exposes individuals to harm caused by accidents and car \r\n    crashes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Each one of these reasons is sufficient to indicate that \r\n    commercial insurance is haraam and that insurance contracts are invalid \r\n    contracts which are not permitted by sharee&rsquo;ah, and that it comes under the \r\n    heading of consuming people's wealth unlawfully.

Examples include sales of property, even \r\n    if you do not know what is inside the walls or foundations, and sales of \r\n    pregnant or suckling animals, even if you do not know the size of the embryo \r\n    or the amount of milk, and even though it is forbidden to sell what is in \r\n    the uterus on its own or the milk on its own (separate from the animal), \r\n    according to most scholars. Another example is selling crops after it is \r\n    clear that they are going to be good (although there cannot be absolute \r\n    certainty), which is permissible according to the Sunnah. The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed the buyer of date palms \r\n    that had been pollinated to stipulate that they should bear fruit, so he \r\n    bought crops before there was any sign that they would be good, but that was \r\n    on the basis of buying the origin (i.e., the trees). Thus it becomes clear \r\n    that in cases of mild ambiguity (when the ambiguity pertains to that which \r\n    is secondary to the original item) it is permitted to do what is not \r\n    permitted in other cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 4\/21&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What seems to be the case is that it is permissible to work \r\n    as a doctor in the insurance department of the hospital and that is not \r\n    regarded as helping in something haraam, because among the patients there \r\n    are those who need this insurance or are compelled to take it out, or the \r\n    company for which they work was forced to take out insurance on them and \r\n    their families.

This is based on the following\r\n    evidence:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Jaabir said: A man had decided that a slave of his would be manumitted\r\n        after his death, but later on he was in need of money, so the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) took the slave and said, &ldquo;Who will buy this slave\r\n        from me?&rdquo; Nu&rsquo;aym ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah bought him, and he (the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\n        and blessings of Allaah be upon him) handed the slave over to him. (Narrated by\r\n        al-Bukhaari, 2034; Muslim, 997). Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter titled\r\n        &ldquo;<i>Baab bay&rsquo; al-Muzaayadah<\/i> (Chapter: selling by auction).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Ibn Hajar said: Ibn Battaal replied that the words of\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in this hadeeth, &ldquo;Who will\r\n    buy this slave from me?&rdquo; indicate that he was offering him to the highest bidder so\r\n    that the needs of the bankrupt man for whom he was selling him could be met. (<i>Fath\r\n    al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/354).<\/p>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>2. &lsquo;Ataa&rsquo; said: I met some people who saw\r\n      nothing wrong with selling booty to the highest bidder. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in <i>Kitaab\r\n      al-Buyoo&rsquo;<\/i> (the book of sales), <i>Baab bay&rsquo; al-Muzaayadah<\/i> (Chapter:\r\n      selling by auction)).<\/p>\r\n      \r\n    <\/blockquote>\r\n    <p>Secondly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Rational evidence:<\/p>\r\n    <p>In an auction, the vendor offers his goods for sale, and the purchaser\r\n    offers to buy them for a certain price. If the vendor does not accept that price, that is\r\n    the end of the matter and there is no transaction. The he will say, &ldquo;Who will offer\r\n    more?&rdquo; A second purchaser can then offer a higher price, and so on. <\/p>\r\n    <p>In this case, each offer is a separate and independent deal, and there\r\n    is nothing wrong with that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some scholars, such as al-Oozaa&rsquo;i and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, said\r\n    that auctions can be used only to sell booty and inherited goods. Their evidence was the\r\n    following hadeeth:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) forbade anyone of you from seeking to outbid one another, except in the case of booty\r\n    and inherited goods.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>(Narrated by Ahmad, 5398; al-Daaraqutni, 3\/11; al-Bayhaqi, 5\/344;\r\n    al-Tabaraani in <i>al-Awsat<\/i>, 8\/198).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The response to the view is:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth is weak, because it includes &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn\r\n    Lahee&rsquo;ah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth of Jaabir is general, and the ruling remains general in\r\n    application.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence Imaam al-Tirmidhi said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>On the basis of the hadeeth of Jaabir, some scholars did not see\r\n    anything wrong with selling booty or inherited goods to the highest bidder.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <\/p>\r\n    <p>There is no point on restricting auctions only to these two kinds of\r\n    goods. There is no difference between these goods and others; they are all the same.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(See <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/354).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some scholars, including Ibraaheem al-Nakha&rsquo;i, regarded this kind\r\n    of sale as makrooh. Their evidence was the hadeeth of Sufyaan ibn Wahb:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;I heard the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) forbid selling by auction.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Response:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The hadeeth was narrated by al-Bazzaar, but it is weak, because it\r\n        includes Ibn Lahee&rsquo;ah. (See <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/354).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      \r\n      <li><p>It is contradicted by reports which are more sound, as we have stated\r\n        above.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Fifthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is no contradiction between auctions and a man outbidding his\r\n    brother, which is forbidden according to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: &ldquo;The Messenger\r\n    of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a city-dweller to sell to a\r\n    Bedouin, and he forbade us to inflate prices artificially and to outbid one another.&rdquo;\r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2033; Muslim, 1413).<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is meant by this hadeeth is when the vendor and\r\n    purchaser have come to an agreement and are bargaining over the price, and a third party\r\n    comes and tempts the purchaser to cancel the transaction. But this does not apply to\r\n    auctions, because in an auction it is the vendor who cancels the transaction by asking who\r\n    will offer more; the people who are present at an auction are already involved, and\r\n    everyone is aware that anyone may increase the price.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Sixthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The warning against engaging in najsh (artificially inflating prices\r\n    with a fraudulent intention). In Arabic the word najsh means provoking, and is also used\r\n    to refer to the action of prodding a bird to enter a trap. It refers to pushing the\r\n    purchaser to fall into the vendor&rsquo;s trap so that he buys at an inflated price. This\r\n    is achieved by having another man attend the auction and make bids without wanting to buy,\r\n    in order to raise the price. Whether this is done by agreement with the vendor or not, it\r\n    is prohibited by the hadeeth, &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) forbade artificial inflation of prices.&rdquo; (Narrated by\r\n    al-Bukhaari, 2035; Muslim, 1516).<\/p>\r\n    <p>In conclusion: auctions are one of the types of sale\r\n    that are permitted according to Islamic sharee&rsquo;ah. This is also the consensus of the\r\n    Muslims in their marketplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"7958","question_id":"7958","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<o>\r\n    <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>Firstly:\r\n      those who are responsible for requesting samples for quality-control\r\n      testing must ask for the amount that is usually sufficient for testing,\r\n      and not ask for or accept more than what is needed.<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>Secondly:\r\n      in cases where only some of the amount given is sufficient, whatever is\r\n      left over must be handed back to its owner.

But because, in many cases, this method of attracting\r\n    business has gone too far, we have to mention these general principles in detail, paying\r\n    special attention to the aims of Sharee&#146;ah and correct etiquette. This includes the\r\n    following points:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Firstly: the businessman must have a good intention when advertising,\r\n    i.e. his intention should be to acquaint people with the advantages of his goods or\r\n    services, to draw their attention to things they did not know about them, and to provide\r\n    other information that they may need about them.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly: he must always be honest in his advertising; what he says\r\n    must reflect the reality of the product or service. Honesty is an essential fundamental in\r\n    all dealings, but especially in selling. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) said: &#147;The two parties engaged in a transaction have the choice of either\r\n    going ahead with the transaction or canceling it, until they part. If they are open and\r\n    honest, their transaction will be blessed for them, but if they conceal things and tell\r\n    lies, that will destroy the Barakah (blessing) of their transaction.&#148; (Narrated\r\n    by al-Bukhaari, no. 2079 (2\/82-83), and by Muslim, 1532 (3\/162), from the hadeeth of\r\n    Hakeem ibn Hizaam). One of the essential means of being honest is to avoid\r\n    over-praising a product or service or exaggerating about it, for this could go beyond the\r\n    bounds of being open and honest. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    said: &#147;Try not to praise products to one another&#148; (Al-Tirmidhi, no. 1268), i.e., the vendor should not praise it in order to encourage the one who hears\r\n    him to buy it, so that the only reason he buys it is what the vendor says. Some of the\r\n    scholars counted praise of a product for what it is as a kind of insane or senseless\r\n    speech from which people should refrain. The guideline here is that the vendor should\r\n    refrain from saying anything which could later result in regret on the part of the\r\n    purchaser.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly: the vendor should avoid any kind of cheating and deception in\r\n    his advertising; i.e., he should not make the product appear more attractive than it is,\r\n    or conceal its faults, or praise it in terms of characteristics and features that it does\r\n    not have. All of this is haraam, as stated above.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly: a vendor&#146;s advertising should not include any\r\n    condemnation or belittling of any other person's products or services, and it should not\r\n    try to cause harm unjustly to others. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said: &#147;None of you truly believes until he wants for his brother what he wants\r\n    for himself.&#148; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 13 (1\/2), and by Muslim, no. 45\r\n    (1\/67), from the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik). The guideline here is that if\r\n    something would cause him distress if it were done to him, he should not do it to others.\r\n    The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;There should be no\r\n    harm and no reciprocating of harm.&#148; (Narrated by Ahmad, 5\/326-327, 313), and\r\n    by Ibn Maajah, no. 2340-2341, from the hadeeth of &#145;Ubaadah ibn Saamit).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fifthly: the advertising should contain nothing that\r\n    calls people to be extravagant or to spend too much, because these are things that are\r\n    forbidden in Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;&#133; and waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not\r\n    Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance).&#148; [al-An&#146;aam 6:141]<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a\r\n    spendthrift. Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayaateen (devils)&#148;\r\n    [al-Israa&#146; 17:26-27]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Sixthly: the advertising should contain nothing that violates the\r\n    sanctity of the pure sharee&#146;ah, such as advertising haraam things or being\r\n    accompanied by things that are not allowed, such as music and singing, or showing women,\r\n    and so on.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Seventhly: the advertising should not be so expensive that the consumer\r\n    has to pay towards the cost of the advertising. It should be brief and to the point,\r\n    concisely describing the product or service without going to extremes that may cause the\r\n    price to be raised. <\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: From Al-Hawaafiz al-Tijaariyyah al-Tasweeqiyyah by Khaalid ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah Al-Muslih, 209"},{"id":"7975","question_id":"7975","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is nothing wrong with doing this kind of work, so long as the\r\n    conditions laid down by Sharee&rsquo;ah are adhered to.

He <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Allaah is the One Who withholds, bestows and sets values. I hope\r\n    that I will not meet Allaah with anyone demanding restitution from me for any wrongdoing I\r\n    may have done to him with regard to his blood or his wealth.&rdquo; (Narrated by\r\n    Imaam Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad<\/i>, 3\/165, 286; al-Tirmidhi, <i>Kitaab<\/i> <i>al-Buyoo&rsquo;<\/i>,\r\n    no. 1314, 3\/597; Ibn Maajah, no. 2200, 2\/741. All of them narrated from the hadeeth of\r\n    Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly: sharee&rsquo;ah encourages people to be\r\n    easygoing when buying and selling, and in all transactions. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;May Allaah have mercy on a man who is easygoing when he buys,\r\n    when he sells and when he asks for payment.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no.\r\n    2076, 2\/81, from the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah, may Allaah be pleased with\r\n    them both).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Undoubtedly selling something for less than the going\r\n    rate is included in this. Ibn Rushd said, concerning a person who sells something more\r\n    cheaply that others in the marketplace: &ldquo;He will be thanked for that if he does it\r\n    for the sake of people, and he will be rewarded for it if he does it for the sake of\r\n    Allaah.&rdquo; (<i>al-Bayaan wa&rsquo;l-Tahseel<\/i>, 9\/306)<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly: the price of goods and services belongs by\r\n    right to their owners, and nobody has the right to dictate to them concerning that or to\r\n    force their opinions concerning their value. (See <i>Tabayyun al-Haqaa&rsquo;iq<\/i>,\r\n    6\/28; <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 6\/312)<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some scholars said that it is not permissible to sell\r\n    goods and services for less than the going rate. This is the view of the Maalikis.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The more correct view is that it is permissible to sell things for less\r\n    than the going rate, because of the strength of the evidence that this is so, and because\r\n    sales and other transactions (barter) are based on the mutual consent of the parties\r\n    involved, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent&rdquo;\r\n    [al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:29].<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>If the vendor agrees to sell his goods or services for a price less\r\n    than the prevailing market rate, there is no reason why he should be prevented from doing\r\n    so, as the general guideline is that sales are basically permissible. Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;Allaah has permitted trading&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:275]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>So no sales should be prevented unless it is on the grounds of reliable\r\n    evidence. But if the Muslim leader thinks that the interests of the people can only be\r\n    served by preventing sales at less than the going rate, because leaving things as they are\r\n    may cause corruption, then it is permissible (to put a stop to these sales), and there is\r\n    nothing wrong with doing so, because the aim is to put things right for people. If the\r\n    only way to do this is to put a stop to sales at less than the going price, then this is\r\n    permissible and may indeed be obligatory.
