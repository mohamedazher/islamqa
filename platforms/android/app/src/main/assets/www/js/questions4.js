Inside it there is a room for exercise that is only for women. All the women in charge of this building and those who frequent it are religiously committed and wear hijab, and they do not allow any man to enter it at all. The doctor has advised me and my sister to exercise in order to overcome our general state of weakness and muscular and joint pain. They have also given similar advice to my mother, because she suffers from osteoporosis. My sister and I go to that gym wearing full hijab and covering ourselves properly, but when we enter it we exercise wearing clothing like that which we wear in front of our mahrams; there is no indecency there or extreme uncovering at all; only our heads and forearms are uncovered, and that is in safe rooms that are entirely enclosed inside this building, and all the people around us are women. Is it permissible for us to do that or does it come under the heading of what is forbidden by the two hadeeths quoted above?\r\n\r\nI would also like to find out from you any exemptions to the prohibition in the two hadeeths if there is any? Does it also mean that it is not permissible to go to beauty parlours or hairdressers who work with women who wear hijab for the purpose of simple and permissible beautification in which there is nothing that is contrary to the laws of Allah, in places that are safe, where all the workers are women, even if one of my mahrams is going to take me there and back by car?

Then he discussed it with another brother, who presented specious arguments that confused him. He asked me for refutations and answers that would put his mind at rest, but I told him that I would not respond on my own initiative; rather I would consult shaykhs and scholars. The specious arguments are as follows:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThe reports which say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to a man who let his garment come below his ankles: &ldquo;|Do you not have an example in me?&rdquo; They say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not rebuke the man and did not tell him not to do that, which indicates &ndash; or so they claim &ndash; that the prohibition and warning mentioned in the other hadeeths may be understood as meaning that it is mustahabb not to let the garment come below the ankles or, in other words, that letting the garment come below the ankles (isbaal) is makrooh.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThey quote the following two opinions as evidence: it was narrated that Ibn Mas&lsquo;ood (may Allah be pleased with him) used to let his izaar (waist wrapper or lower garment) hang below his ankles. When something was said to him about that, he said: My legs are thin and I lead the people in prayer. And it was narrated that Ma&lsquo;mar said: Ayyoob was criticised for the length of his chemise and he said: In the past, fame and vanity was connected to how long it is but today it is connected to how much it is cut off. So they say: if isbaal were haraam or a major sin, Ibn Mas&lsquo;ood and Ayyoob would not have made their izaars or chemises long.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThey say: How can isbaal be equated with drinking alcohol, for example, in the sense that they are both major sins?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThey say: The majority are of the view that isbaal is makrooh. I do not know where they get this idea from.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nIn the story of the martyrdom of &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), it says: A young man came and said: Be of good cheer, O Ameer al-Mu&rsquo;mineen, for there are glad tidings from Allah to you; you accompanied the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and you were one of the earliest Muslims, as you know, then you were appointed caliph and you were just, then you attained martyrdom. He said: I wish the outcome of all that will be neither against me or for me. When he (the young man) turned away, &lsquo;Umar saw that his izaar was touching the ground. He said: Bring the young man back to me. He said: O son of my brother, pull up your garment, for it is cleaner for your garment and more fearing of your Lord. They say: This indicates that Sayyiduna &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did not stop enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, even if it was a minor matter or it was makrooh &ndash; as was the way of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all), or that he saw something in the young man&rsquo;s heart or the way he conducted himself that would be warded off by means of him pulling up his garment.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nThey say that the martyr is undoubtedly one of the people of Paradise, yet despite that he may be one who lets his garment come below the ankle, so how can the warnings mentioned in the hadeeth &ndash; &ldquo;it is in the Fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Allah will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He praise them, and theirs will be a painful punishment&rdquo; &ndash; be applicable to him when he is one of the people of Paradise?\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nIt is proven that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): My izaar drops unless I not pay attention to it, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;You are not one of those who do that out of pride.&rdquo; So they say: this indicates that the warning mentioned in the hadeeths applies to those who do that out of pride.\r\n\r\nI hope that you can give us responses and answers that will put our brothers&rsquo; and others&rsquo; minds at rest.

Three years ago I started to recite ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah for people, according to proper guidelines but not in any organized fashion, in return for money which I use on some of my needs. Allaah decreed that my ruqyahs be accepted and Allaah has healed many people at my hands and guided others to the right path and helped them to believe in His Oneness and to keep away from shirk, despite the hassles that I have faced from some of the charlatans, biased people and those who seek to prevent shar&rsquo;i ruqyah which they describe as bid&rsquo;ah and haraam earnings. Too many people started coming to me and urging to help them because there are no people who devote their time to reciting ruqyah. All of these people are coming to me for ruqyah in my home which is very humble, which causes me a lot of hardship and difficulty, and it bothers my family because people knock at the door so much, and I have started to neglect my other duties because of reciting ruqyah for them because I feel too shy to refuse. I thought of renting a place which I can use specifically for reciting ruqyah as prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah and cupping in return for approximately 20 riyals for doing ruqyah for one person, and that charge will go towards paying the rent and some of my essential needs. But I was surprised when some Muslims who claim to have knowledge denounced me for specializing in this and said that specializing in this was a bid&rsquo;ah and was not known among the salaf of this ummah, and that money earned in this way is haraam.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to open a clinic for ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah and cupping in return for money, especially since I am in need and am not well off, and I have responsibilities towards my family, and I am suffering from a chronic illness and cannot do heavy work, and the Muslims are in need of someone who can specialize in ruqyah and call them to Tawheed and forbid them from shirk?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf it is permissible to open a Qur&rsquo;aanic clinic, then after that I find a job, there are further questions to be answered:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1-  Should I stop doing ruqyah and take this job even though this would result in several negative consequences such as not being able to do this good deed and this will create a vacuum in this area?\r\n\r\n2-  Should I combine both and try to reconcile between them without letting one of them affect the other?\r\n\r\n3-  Should I refuse to work and be content with doing ruqyah because it benefits others and serves the interests of the Muslims?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf it is not permissible to open a Qur&rsquo;aanic clinic:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1-   Should I stop doing ruqyah altogether?\r\n\r\n2-   Is it better to carry on doing ruqyah in my house and not specialize in it, and put up with people&rsquo;s annoyances?.","question_url":"\/en\/60162","question_no":"60162","status":"done"},{"id":"9625","category_id":"373","question":"He is asking about a ruqyah so that he will be blessed with a child.","question_full":"One of my brother is married for last 5 years and till today they do not any children.

Now after four years I will be going home in sha Allaah, but I have resolved not to go with him until I have completed my sharee&rsquo;ah studies or at least completed my diploma in the study of the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat advice can you give to me and to my husband? I want him to read this letter, noting that my husband does not have sufficient time for me to sit with him and read Islamic books.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband is very active in da&rsquo;wah outside the home, but inside the home he is not like that. He sits in his den at home and locks the door, and he tells me that the people&rsquo;s interests are more important than the family&rsquo;s interests, but it should be noted that I need him to take the children away from me and take care of them because I become sick (praise be to Allaah in all situations). I ask Allaah Almighty, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, to heal me.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt has reached the stage where I now hate him for his shortcomings, for he spends all his time in meetings in the mosque. At the beginning of our marriage, four years ago, I was trying to memorize Qur&rsquo;aan but he did not help me with that and he would never listen to my recitation. I tried to read Qur&rsquo;aan to him, but he could not do that because he is busy with meetings and other things. He relaxes at home for fifteen to thirty minutes, but it should be noted that he has set aside one day to stay at home, following heated arguments between him and me. All the time I sit alone with my children and he has never appreciated that, to the point that I am fed up with him and the society in which I live. I turned to Allaah and I do not complain to my family; in fact I praise my husband in front of them, hoping that Allaah will change him and make him pay attention to his family. Note that I am living overseas far away from my family and brothers. He also has another fault: if I ask him for money to buy what I need, he tells me that he does not have money, but I know that he is spending on his family and brothers. I am not telling him not to spend on his parents, rather he has the duty to spend on them. But he is very stingy towards me and my children.

All my life I interacted with others on the basis that I am a human being before being female and the slave woman of Allaah as much as I could, and that based on this, whoever does good, whether male or female, will be rewarded, and whoever commits sin will bear the burden of sin. But after I got married I was surprised by some rulings which treat me as if I am not human, because they treat me as if I am only an object for the enjoyment of the man, such as the fact that the angels will curse me if I refuse intimacy under any circumstances, at the time when he is under no such burden if he refuses to have intercourse with his wife even if he does that to cause her harm. So he gets the reward of doing charity if he has intercourse with her and enjoys intimacy with her, and she will not have any reward, even if she responds unwillingly. If he upsets me and humiliates me in front of people, I have to make up with him and try to please him, otherwise the angels will curse me. And of course I have no right to differ with his opinion or to argue with him, and if I lose my temper I am not forgiven. And, as you have stated in a fatwa, the reward for praying in congregation is only for men and not for women. Is this what Allaah has prescribed for us?

What should he do?.","question_full":"&nbsp;I used to be very sinful, my most beloved hobby was to sin. I used to take drugs (hashish, pills, and wine) and I used also to commit adultry. \r\n\r\nBy Allah&rsquo;s grace, I repented from the sin of adultry before marriage but the sin of taking drugs remained. It was because of the bad companions I had. Then one of my cousins died, he was of similar age to me. But he was not married, I thought about my situationand that someone who is younger than me has passed away, and we were comitting the same sin togeather, taking drugs. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nAllah has guided me by His grace, so I gave up all sins, I even broke the satellite dish. My life has changed 180 degrees. I became charitable, pray, call people for good and denounce evil, distribute tapes and booklets and attend lectures.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe problem:&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI face criticism, starting from family, mother and sisters, that I am strict. They want to listen to songs and watch series on television. If I advise them and say that what they are doing is haram they say: &ldquo;why is istighfaar (seeking Allah&rsquo;s forgiveness) prescribed?, If you do not want to listen to songs and watch television then leave, we want to watch and listen&rdquo; the same problem happens at work as well, I have left home more than one time, my wife stays with them, I take her with me when I leave, but they ask me to let her stay with them. I refuse and my wife feels embarrassed and fears her situation causes any problems. But when I leave her with them, she sits far from TV and from where they sit.&nbsp;\r\nSometimes I hear my mother making du&rsquo;aa against me saying: &ldquo;I wish Allah did not guide you, you made us restless&rdquo; I seek refuge with Allah from what she says.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy problem at work is, that I work in a military sector, all colleagues are bad, the religious ones are only three, there are six bearded brothers. They get over so many things, the rest of them take hashish and drugs, flirt women and majority are of course smokers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey all agreed on insulting me, whenever I sit with them, they remind me of my past. They mock the bearded brothers, slander them and describe them as (liers and terrorists) and I feel jealous for them and say: &ldquo;you are slandering your brothers, they are muslims, you should not mock the beard because it is sunnah to keep it&rdquo;.\r\nSheikh, they gave me bad reputaion, they always critisize the bearded brothers, they never mention anything good about them.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIs letting my beard grow, abiding by sharia, enjoining good and denouncing evil in this time a crime that I have to pay for, or become immoral like them?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEven my boss, he says: &ldquo;you bearded men, I will put you under the misoscope, I will not forgive any mistake you do&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI have tried some solutions:&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirstly: I asked to move to another administration, but my request will take some time.\r\n\r\nSecondly: I cut my relationship with everyone insulted me by a word or an action. This helped limit the problem. But I do not like this way, as people became careful when they deal with me and fear that anything they say may be disliked by me. So they dislike me and make others dislike me as well.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI wish you provide me with the suitable solution for my problem because I became really tired of it.","question_url":"\/en\/106447","question_no":"106447","status":"done"},{"id":"9697","category_id":"417","question":"Daa\u2019iyah asking about books on the topic of takfeer, implementation of sharee\u2019ah and seeking the help of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).","question_full":"I am doing da&rsquo;wah, and I have been asked some questions about takfeer and rebelling against rulers, and also about seeking intercession through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asking him for help.

I am 25 years old, but I have some awareness of many issues, but without any deeply rooted knowledge. There is another issue: I am a young man whom Allaah has blessed with physical strength and good looks, and I fear for myself at the time of fitnah in which we are living. Moreover, it is not easy to find another like the girl I want to marry, because she comes from a very committed family, and I love her father and brothers, and I hope there will be ties of marriage between us.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2 &ndash; Time requirement for acquiring knowledge. How many hours must I spend acquiring knowledge, apart from the time devoted to the Qur'aan, because I set aside special time for reading and memorizing Qur&rsquo;aan.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3 &ndash; Internet and satellite channels. I spend about an hour and a half each day looking at religious sites on the internet, such as your site and the Muslim site (Dr. Naasir &lsquo;Umar) and Islamnet. I also spend about an hour each day watching the al-Jazeera news channel and any program that discusses important issues on other channels. This is with the aim of educating myself about various aspects of life. Should I continue doing that, or should I use this time to seek knowledge or do acts of worship?.","question_url":"\/en\/76010","question_no":"76010","status":"done"},{"id":"9867","category_id":"446","question":"She wants some advice for her Christian classmates.","question_full":"In the University where I am studying there is a considerable number of Christians, and it has reached a stage where some of them are proselytizing, even though they are in a Muslim country and living among the Muslims.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne of them even carries the Gospel with her, and another book about &ldquo;faith&rdquo;, on which there is a picture of the Virgin Mary (peace be upon her), and she encourages the girls to read it.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter that, from speaking to her I found out that she is active in the church, and she teaches the children there.

This program is an advertising mediator between two sides, the first is a company or association that owns a website and wants to advertise for it by this paid service. The second is websites&rsquo; owners who want these advertisements to be shown on their websites for Google&rsquo;s favour versus money. \r\n\r\nThe terms and conditions of Google Company includes that they do not accept advertising for sites of certain activities such as pornographic, gambling, and drugs whether it was the first side or the second. But being non-Islamic company it accepts sites with other haram activities such as banks that deal with interest, forex, movies and songs, tourism, and women affairs. Some normal websites will even show pictures of women with full make up on.  \r\n\r\nAfter linking with Google Adsense, I receive the (advertising code) for AdSense, and then I put it on my website (my website is about teaching Chinese). This code afterwards works automatically in this way: the code reads all the words, main words, and all other words on the webpage where the code is on. Then the advertisements automatically come up the page according to the subject of that page. This code also shows the advertisements in accordance with the country of the visitor of the site or page.\r\n\r\nThe advertisements that the code show get changed in a frequent way which is difficult to observe. So if the website is about cars, most of the advertisements will be also about cars, and if it was about herbs then most of the advertisements will be also about herbs and so on. \r\n\r\nIf two men are visiting the same website at the same time, one from Canada and the other from Japan, every one will see a different advertisement. Also you will not see an advertisement that you saw yesterday on a page on the same page the next day. \r\n\r\nThe way of controlling the advertisements shown by AdSense code: \r\n\r\n1- Observing all advertisements: this happens via an observation program that enables me to see most of the advertisements on my website now whether in my country or other countries. \r\n\r\n2- Filtering: this attributes enables me to prevent a specific advertisement to be shown on my website by adding it to my filter list which is for maximum 200 sites. But this filtering does not mean that a specific advertisement I prevented from showing previously will not be shown again. Google says exactly: &ldquo;Please note that Google does not commit that all ads for the websites that you add to your competitive ad filter list or ads containing objectionable content will be prevented from display on your site.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nActually through my personal experiment I found that this filtering really works. Please guide me as this is my main source of income. Note that I do not show any pictures of humans or animals on my website.

There is an answer to a question like mine, but I want to have further clarification on a few issues, so please not refrain from answering me because of that. I graduated from law school a few years ago and I am now working &ndash; part-time &ndash; as a lawyer. At the time when I entered this college I did not have proper understanding of my religion, then after I graduated I found out that judging according to something other than that which Allaah has revealed is a major sin. I found out that many laws in my country go against the laws of Allaah and transgress His sacred limits. I wondered whether it is permissible for me in this situation to work as a lawyer with what that involves of referring for judgement to something other than the laws of Allaah. If I work with the laws that go against sharee&rsquo;ah will I incur sin as a result?  But before you advise me about that, I would like to explain some other things &ndash; whether I am right or wrong about them &ndash; so that you will know what thoughts are going around in my mind and you will be able to offer me sound advice. I do not approve at all of laws that go against sharee&rsquo;ah, no matter what benefits could result from that law. If I practice this profession I will keep away as much as possible from the laws that go against the laws of Allaah. If I find a case concerning which the laws go against sharee&rsquo;ah I will not accept it, no matter what the financial gains I may earn from that.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf I deal with the unjust laws in order to do attain people&rsquo;s rights, not to bring about wrongdoing, will I be referring for judgement to something other than that which Allaah has revealed? For example, if I refer to the laws on taxes and customs, especially the laws on penalties that go against the rulings of Allaah in most cases &ndash; in order to restore people&rsquo;s rights or to prevents people&rsquo;s rights being lost due to the implementation of these laws. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter explaining the above, practising law by keeping away from issues that go against sharee&rsquo;ah, except in cases of necessity to restore people&rsquo;s rights, is that regarded as applying and referring for judgement to a law other than the law of Allaah? Is reading books of law and spending money on that regarded as wasting time and money on something that is not pleasing to Allaah? If I read these books &ndash; assuming that I am not going to practice this profession &ndash; simply to find out the laws and systems that are imposed on us in all aspects of our lives, whether they are in accordance with the laws of Allaah or not, is that regarded as haraam?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter all that, should I leave the law profession with no regrets and burn my many books, or regard it as something I do occasionally, seeking my basic living in some other way, so as to meet some of my needs and those of others in a way that does not go against sharee&rsquo;ah, and to restore our rights and have knowledge of the laws that are imposed on us, so that we will not be exposed to exploitation or lose our rights , in addition to taking care of other benefits to which sharee&rsquo;ah pays attention.","question_url":"\/en\/75613","question_no":"75613","status":"done"},{"id":"9944","category_id":"333","question":"Ruling on tips for workers and the ruling on working in a hotel in which there are haraam things.","question_full":"I work in a hotel in Sharm al-Sheikh and my job is to carry suitcases for foreigners and any guest who comes to the hotel.

Our company has its own cars which are rented from one of the car rental companies for the use of our company. Please note that the value of the fee paid to the car rental company includes comprehensive insurance for the car against any accident, Allah forbid. (Although we we have some reservations about the car insurance because it is haraam according to sharee&lsquo;ah). But this is the situation with regard to the company cars. Based on that I want to ask you about the ruling on using the company car allocated to me for personal use, knowing that I will pay for gas, oil change, filters and car washes only from my own money, because these are things that are consumed when using it. Please also note that our company has no additional expenses as a result of using the company car for personal use, apart from what I have mentioned above. Even accidents are covered by the same insurance. I would also add that if the car is only used for work, there would never be any savings for our company; the rate of use would be very low and would not be worth the cost of renting that is paid for the car; rather the only one to benefit would be the car rental company. Please note that it takes the full amount for the rental period regardless of how much it is used, which is regarded as expenditure with no benefit. Based on that, we hope that you can advise us, may Allah reward you with good, about the shar&lsquo;i ruling on this matter. If the ruling is that it is permissible as long as one takes permission from our company, is it sufficient to take permission from our manager only? Please note that he is in charge of allocating cars, taking them away and everything that has to do with them.

I am a young doctor, and got married three years ago. My fianc&eacute;e (now my wife) was a very good person, and she was easy going. But after marriage all that changed. I had debts, and she knew all about my income, but she still used to ask me for money of her own. When I tried to convince her to be patient and wait until I had paid off my debts, and that she should help me with that, she went crazy and told my mother in law, who kept insisting that I do as her daughter wanted, but I refused.  Then she asked me to let her go to work, although we had agreed that she should not work unless I was unable to work. My mother in law kept bothering me a lot, until I agreed. After that there arose a lot of problems. She used to &ndash; and still does &ndash; treat my father and mother in an inappropriate manner; it has got to the point where she humiliates them. After we got married, Allaah blessed us with a little girl who is the envy of others. The point is that she went out of the house without my permission more than once, and she was not deterred by my speaking to her or forsaking her in bed or hitting her. She embarrassed me in front of the people who live in the same building as us, because she was talking about our problems to the other residents, our neighbours and her friends and relatives. All attempts to deal with her have failed; even the shaykh at the mosque spoke to her, but it did no good. The result of all this is that I no longer have any feelings for her; we have had a lot of arguments and I have divorced her (talaaq) twice, then we got back together for the sake of our young daughter whom Allaah gave to us. Recently my in-laws came back from a trip and she went to them on the basis that she would stay for a few days, then the time was extended to thirty days because her father is sick and her mother is old. When I asked her and my daughter to come back to my house, she refused, and when I spoke to her father he refused to send her back to her marital home. I threatened to take the matter to court but they did not care. I discovered that my wife and daughter&rsquo;s personal papers, passports and gold are missing (she took them before she went to her family&rsquo;s house).

Only a few months ago I came to the point when I asked my husband for a divorce because he neglected his Salaat even though he had been told about his duties, and he also had developed a bad habit of threatening with divorce and actually throwing me out of the house when he lost his temper. But when he realised that I was actually going to leave him, he repented and changed his ways, so I withdrew my question and returned. But there is still some tension between us. This is mostly due to the fact that as it is today, my husbands eeman is weaker than mine. I do not think I am perfect, and I know I also make mistakes. But I constantly see my husband doing things that are wrong (both things haram and makruh), and I cannot restrain myself and not speak to him about it. This is for example like using bad language in front of our daughter, or biting and kissing her in places where she should rather learn shyness, etc. When I tell him that it is not good to do these things, and sometimes I am able to give evidence from Qur'an and Sunna, he will either say that he knows this, and then continue with what he is doing, or become angry and tell me to mind my own business. This is a source of irritation for both me and my husband, and we are losing patience with each other. My question is: What is my test from Allah here? Is it not my duty to inform or remind him of what is right when I know it? Or should I be patient with him and wait till he finds out for himself, because he has started to read Islamic books.

My problem involves a long and complicated story that I will try my best to explain from both sides point of view because I genuinely want to do what is Islamicly correct and what will lead me to the Jannah inshaAllah. When I was a young child I was in an accident where I was hit by a school bus. my parents went through a very long and hard process in which they sued for some compensation because at the time they were unsure if I would be able to walk properly or need help throughout my life. Alhamdulillah for the most part I am fine and this is because two surgeries and the countless hours that they spent doing physical therapy with me and taking me to numerous doctor&rsquo;s appointments. We were not very well off and lived in a very unsafe neighborhood so they asked the judge if they could use some of the money to buy a house in my name in a safer suburb, as it would be in my best interest and that of my family. They always paid for maintenance and taxes and they made sure to explain to the judge and ensure that the remainder of my money was always invested in a hallal manner. A long story short, we ended up selling the house and moving to UAE, but my mother and brother and I returned a year later. I was getting married. My mother needed to stay with my brother who insisted on coming back and to take care of her father, as she is his only living relative. I had always wanted give my parents a house growing up. It is the least that I could do for everything they had done for me. My husband (we at this time had done the contract but not the wallimah) insisted that I put my name on the house so that when my parents pass I will have it and it may benefit our future kids. I honestly did not want to do that, I wanted to give it to the purely and completely and did not care if they sold it and threw the money in the ocean dollar by dollar. We argued, and finally and consented, may Allah forgive me. I bought my mother a house and it is in both of our names. At the start of my marriage I told my husband &ldquo;my money is your money if you want to do business with it as long as you do not do anything that involves riba, alcohol or pork because this is the way I was raised and I believe that there will not be any barrakah in harram money.&rdquo; He agreed. They later he came with ideas of putting the money as a down payment on an apartment complex and buying it through a riba based loan and the idea of opening a pizza franchise that sells pork. I told him &ldquo;no, haram&rdquo;. He spent a lot of time looking for small shopping centers and other investments to buy. He ended up buying 40 acres of land and 2 condos that he rented out. Also we bought a town home in which we lived in. He never really got a job and we were living off of the remainder of the money. He would have ideas here and there, nothing really went though. After about a year and a half of living rather extravagantly, money was getting low; he said we need to budget. For my part and the cost of food at home and shopping, I did. I only spent $350 on house hold purchases and I never bought anything for myself. He made silly purchases like cars and gadgets and ate out at restraunts every day with his friends (with his own mouth he admitted he would spend over $1500 just on out side food). He was out almost every night playing pool and with his friends, he says it was to make connections and that if you want to meet with Arabs and learn ideas to make money they all come out at night. He would come home after 2 and 3 am at least 4 nights out of the week. As money got low he would sell off an investment property and took out a cash out mortgage on one of them, each time saying that this time he was not going to let the money go to waste and each time not changing, not really working and spending freely. But at home wallahi this was not the case. I lived with a leaky kitchen sink for over 2 years and w\/ electrical problems so that the lights didn&rsquo;t work and also many of the outlets. Our water heater was broken for months before he fixed it. Soon after my son was born (he is 15 months now) all of the money was gone and he blamed me because if we had done it the was he wanted we would be rich. He became extremely abusive to me; he was always horrible when he was mad; he hits me, uses the most foul language and threatened to take my son away from me and to make him hate me. Then one day he came to me and said &ldquo;this is what you are going to do, and if u don&rsquo;t I will put you in my head and make you miserable because that means that you don&rsquo;t want to help and stand with me&rdquo;. Wallahi I was terrified of him, after months of being treated like an animal I believed him. He told me to tell my father that he got into a fight with a mechanic and threw a wrench at him and that it shattered his jaw and now we are being sued and that if we don&rsquo;t pay the man and the lawyers he will go to jail. I told my husband, please don&rsquo;t make me tell my father that because it will terrify him and he will think that you are violent with me. ( I never told them how he treats me because my father is greatly affected by stress and I don&rsquo;t want to hurt him, and also because I believe that if he gets involved my husband will hurt him) Then my husband agreed to tell him that he was driving with a friend in his car and they got into an accident and the man was injured and that we didn&rsquo;t have car insurance. So the man is suing us and that there are a lot of legal fees and problems because he was breaking the law by driving with out insurance. And then to tell my parents that I need to help my husband and that the only way to do it is for them to take some sort of mortgage on their house through an Islamic financing company. It would have to be in their name because he had ruined our credit. He said that from that money he would give them two years of mortgage payments strait up so that they didn&rsquo;t not have to worry about payments and that he would be the one to make all the payments. To tell them that I need MY money now that we are &ldquo;down&rdquo; and that this is the only way. I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do, and so I did it. His plan was to take this money and open the pizza restraunt I mentioned before; it was not up to me anymore. My parents freaked out. My mom calmed down a little and sounded like she would agree, but that it was up to my dad. My dad said that my husband should go to his parents (who are Saudi and are very well off, but my husband is estranged from his father) for help. He said that I had helped my husband enough and that he had spent over 300,000 dollars and that it is not my job to help him anymore. He also said that he would never agree to mortgage the house because he doesn&rsquo;t trust my husband and that he is going to protect the only thing that I have left. Also they can&rsquo;t trust that he would make the payments as he promises and that they cannot sign on for such a huge debt at this stage in their lives. He threatened to divorce my mom and disown me if we did the mortgage. Obviously, mom would never go against my dad so my husband&rsquo;s plan did not work. My husband became furious. He blamed me because he claims that if I had squeezed my dad hard enough we would have consented and that if they don&rsquo;t want to do it then I should tell them that I have to do what I have to do to help my family and ask them to leave the house so that I can sell it. He hates me and says that I sided with my father against him. He says that my father is wrong and doesn&rsquo;t care about him and that the proof is that he told my father a story that he was in trouble and my father refused to help. My husband sold our town home that we were living in for what ever he could get and we moved into the one bedroom apartment that we took the cash out on. He took what money was left from our home and bought 3 fancy cars (with riba) to start a limo company with a friend. I am now pregnant again and he says that it is my fault that we are living in such a tiny apartment and suffering and our son has no place to play. He says that I came to him and told him I would help him and I gave him the money and then I only went half way, that I&lsquo;ve abandoned him. He says I have a 100 thousand dollars in that house and I&rsquo;m not helping him with it. He says that its not fair that my mother and siblings are living in a three bedroom home with a nice back yard to play in and that we are suffering here. He hates my father in a way that scares me to death. He wants to hurt him in any way. He says all the time that he would love to beat him up. He says that my father is being unjust by keeping my money from me when I asked for it. He says that he will never allow my father to see our son again and if my father comes to our home and tries to see him he will put a gun in his face and scare him. (he has a gun in the house). He says that my parents have no decency to allow me and my son to suffer like this with our offering to help. That if my father&rsquo;s claims of trying to protect my money are true he should at least offer to pay us rent to help our situation. That I have been helping them for the past 15 years that they have been living rent free. He doesn&rsquo;t realize that my parents are getting older and that although they are both working, they need to save for retirement and they are paying for all my grandmother&rsquo;s medical bills and paying to put my brother and sister through college. He says that by siding with my parents and not forcing them to leave or to do what he wanted I betrayed him and that I showed my father that he is nothing to me. He tells me that unless I tell my parents to help us and either give us money every month (charge them rent) or to take out a mortgage on their home he will make my life miserable ( he is doing this already) and never allow me to complete by education. He says that my father is stupid for not agreeing because he has the biggest weapon which is his grandson and that he will turn our son against him and never allow my father to see him. He says that he will tell my son what I have done and how its my fault we are suffering and make him look down on me. He says that it doesn&rsquo;t matter that he -&ldquo;we&rdquo;- spent the money before and that we were young and just learning and we made mistakes and that doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, what matters is now I have that house and I&rsquo;m not helping. He says that now because of me he will have to work like a slave and not have time to spend with his son and that he blames me and my father for every second that he suffers. I don&rsquo;t know what to do!! Do I do nothing and let him punish my father my not allowing him to see my son and Allah knows what else he is planning (because today he said he has plans to make them leave by force and Allah ye3llem what they could be!)? Do try to force my father to do what he wants thereby &ldquo;proving to my husband that he is #1&rdquo; as he demands everyday that I do? I cannot bear to make my mother feel like a guest in her own home after everything she has done for me. I would rather live in the street than take back what I have given her. I&rsquo;m afraid for the safety of my father! I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll give him a heart attack or God knows what else! My husband is threatening and saying that he will find a way to force them to leave with out me or them know what he did. What kind of things is he planning? I don&rsquo;t know how much more I can bear, the physical, emotional and verbal abuse is killing me. I have no appetite. Not to mention that I am pregnant and that under the happiest of marriages our situation would be hard. I also want to put it out there that I am not an angel. This marriage started as a haram relationship, but Allah knows that I repented from that years ago. I am doing my best to be a good muslimah ;alhamdulillah; I pray all my prayers, I try to give sadaqa when I can, I listen to Islamic lectures almost everyday to better myself and be a good example for my son. I make duaa every day to ease my burdens and help me find a solution to this. Also, I don&rsquo;t believe that divorce is an option. My husband has threatened to take my son from me and to only allow me to see him as a visitor in his house. He says that if we get divorced he will blame me for ruining his son&rsquo;s life and will spend the rest of his life making my life and the life of those that I love miserable just to get me back. And I believe that he is sick enough to do it. Also, I want my son to be close to me and at least see some sort of an Islamic role model. He says that if I ever tried to take our son through the courts he would kill me and him or take him and run. I don&rsquo;t want my son to grow up in a dysfunctional environment as much as I can help it. People that I ask say that he is just bluffing but Wallahi I don&rsquo;t think he is, they don&rsquo;t see his face and the way he looks and acts like I do. Please, please make duaa for me and to protect my father and family. Please try to advise me. Should I do as he asks and hope that my parents forgive me and hope that we can live happily ever after, everyone seeing everyone? Or should I do nothing and hope that my husband doesn&rsquo;t hurt them or me? Though Wallahi I believe that he will. Or is my husband right, and I am wrong? Have I betrayed him or let him down? Did I side with my father against him? Have I let my son down by letting us stay in this cramped apartment? And what if my husband carries out some crazy plot to somehow force my family to leave the house, do I then do what he wants and sell it? Or do I refuse to give in? Please respond as soon as possible because my husband is hounding me every day and I am afraid everyday that it will be too late and he will do something crazy. Jazakum Allahu Khairan for providing this service to those who are in need. I really don&rsquo;t know who are where else to turn. Forgive me for being to long-winded.","question_url":"\/en\/126899","question_no":"126899","status":"done"},{"id":"10148","category_id":"353","question":"Is it obligatory to have intercourse on the wedding night?.","question_full":"I want know it is compalssery to intercourse at marraige first night.

My wife was the wife of my brother -- may Allaah have mercy on him -- and he had four daughters and one son from her. My aim in marrying her was to take care of the orphans, even though she is 10 years older than me or more. The ongoing problem has to do with two things which are:\r\n\r\n1. She is extremely jealous all the time, and there is no reason for this extreme jealousy. She is so jealous that she gets suspicious when I speak to my relatives or anyone else.\r\n\r\n2.

Unfortunately, we brought in people we wanted to reconcile between us, but to no avail. These problems that I am facing are happening almost every month and I have tried to divorce her three times, so that I might have a break, but what has prevented me from doing that is that I love my three children and my brother's children very much.

I must start from the beginning for you to understand my problems. In August 2008 I met a man on the internet that was Muslim from Egypt. I was Catholic and I tried to convince him that he was on the wrong path in life. In October he convinced me to go and get a Qur&rsquo;an to read and learn from. I started reading but still could not accept Islam as being the truth. I was married for 22 years to a man that I didn&rsquo;t love and in January 2009 this man convinced me that if I truly believed in God that I could divorce this other man in my heart and I would not have to be with him any longer. I did this and then he told me that he wanted to marry me. He had me say that I such and such take this man such and such as my husband. I believed truly in my heart that he was now my husband in the eyes of God. I divided my first husband&rsquo;s house in two. His house is very large and we could live under the same roof and not see each other. I have a daughter with him and I thought that I could have my house in two apartments so that she could still have a stable life. We talked as husband and wife and he talked with me still about Islam. I asked my first husband for a divorce and then I decided that I would say the shahada on June 2, 2009 for this man that I took as my husband in the eyes of God. At that time I really don&rsquo;t think I truly believed in Islam but I did this for my new husband. After I said the shahada something in me changed. I had to find out more about Islam and I started to feel that Islam is the right path for me. I started to feel that what this man and I had was not a real marriage and I talked to him about this and he said he would send me a marriage contract and I must have it signed by two Muslim men. In January 2010 he sent me a marriage contract signed by him and I searched for two Muslim men that would sign it. I live in the United States in what is known as the Bible belt of America. It took me a long time to find two Muslim men that were willing to sign this paper. My entire family has turned their backs to me for choosing Islam. My brother calls me a Muslim terrorist and will not speak with me. My oldest sister calls me a sand monkey lover and my other sister says that I worship Satan because I pray in a strange language and have a ritual prayer as she calls it. My own mother will not allow me in her house wearing hijab and puts me down always. The only reason any of my family still talks with me is because of my daughter. I have lost all of my family and all of my friends except one friend who we have been friends for more than thirty years. She is the only one to accept me for me. My husband in Islam told me a long time ago not to go to the mosque for prayer, (there is a mosque in my city, and it is a very long ways from me). So I have always prayed at home in my bedroom. Everyday I pray and do duas. Everyday I read my Qur&rsquo;an and hadiths. I am trying to learn Arabic so that I can read and pray in Arabic. I have joined a women&rsquo;s class online to learn Tajweed, fiqh, and the history of Islam. I am trying to be the best Muslim woman, but everything seems so hard for me to deal with. My Muslim husband does wrong and I do cover his sins by not saying what he does. But the things he does hurt me very much. I feel lost in this world filled of hate. I live in constant pain from an injury from long ago and now I am having emotional pain as well. I have three questions and I do not know if you will answer all three, but all are very important to me. First, do I need to resay the shahada? Second am I truly married to this man from Egypt?

To My Husband they gave wrong information about me and my parents as if we ill treated them and created misunderstanding between me and my husband. Listening to his parents, he gave me three thalaq at the same time through a letter stating that due to my health reason he feels that I can&rsquo;t conceive a normal child and not fit for proceeding married life. He was not willing to solve this issue by coming to India so I went to Kuwait to prove him my innocence. There with help of Islamic scholars and relatives we made him understand what he did was out of islam and unkind. Also with help of a doctor i made him understand that there is nothing serious about my illness and that I can conceive. But he was not willing to accept and denied me shelter to spend my hidda period with him. He gave me two options either to stay in In-law&rsquo;s house or in my parent&rsquo;s house and gave me just 80 dinar for maintenance during hidda period.

I went in extreme anger and without pre-planned intention, I pronounced to my wife \"you are divorced, you are divorced second time and you are divorced third time\" in one go.  The following were the prevailing conditions at the time of pronouncements:\r\n\r\ni) Pronouncements were mainly due to my chronic sleeping disorder and continued bad mental condition due to sleeplessness especially after our baby birth.\r\n\r\nii) The anger was so intense that my eyes were closing and blurring. I faced such an extreme angry state second time in my life. Although I was aware of what I am saying but anger was so intense that it compelled me to do so and almost have lost my control over brain.\r\n\r\niii) I have had intercourse with my wife before pronouncement of divorces during her ongoing purity period.\r\n\r\niv) The pronouncements were mainly based on the general perception taken from the media or the society that people divorce the wife by three pronouncements.\r\n\r\nv) After the incident I read the procedure of divorce given in the Quran. I repented a lot that if I had known the procedure and commandments of Allah (SWT) about divorce or had been told by the religious person who taught my Nikah then it did not happen so.\r\n\r\nvi) I swear to Allah (SWT) that if I had known the procedure of divorce explained by Qur&rsquo;an and if I had known that three pronouncements in one go are counted as three irrevocable divorces and is a great sin and person left no chances of reconciliation then I must had not acted so (pronounced thrice).\r\n\r\nWe have already resumed our marital relations based on Qura&rsquo;nic verses, view point of various Ulmahs and Fatwa of Islamic Sharia Council.\r\n\r\nSeeking Ruling\/Fatwa: Although many Fatwas go in my favor, however, still doubts came in my mind.

I was born and raised in Europe by Muslim parents. We began to be very attracted to one another, not least because we are both attracted to another Dunya than this - Jannah. Or at least we want more than simply adhering to the 5 pillars of Islam. We set out to make our relationship halal of course know to get married, but my parents did not accept this man because he comes from another country, ethnicity and status. I decided not to go against my parents wishes and told them that I would drop him. Admittedly, we did not contact each other for a while. In the meantime, I encountered a religious Muslim man in Europe from the same country as my parents. He seemed very religious and cash about Islam and I fell in love all alone in the stories he told about our Prophet, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were other important trait in him which I disliked, I chose to accept his marriage offer because his religious side perhaps reminded me of the first guy I could not marry. To make a long story short, after we were married my husband changed and went no more into religion as much as he goes up in indifference culture, norms and materiel things in the world. He prays, fasts, etc., but this is not enough for me, as I had hoped imagined a lifewhere together we became stronger in religion, taught the Koran together, etc.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, we disagree about almost everything, often argue and his family mixone part in our affairs and creates problems for us. We have tried to solve our maritalproblems several times through dialogues, etc., but regardless, it helps. We fail, however, sometimes to have quiet periods, not because we have agreed but because we intentionally keep the discussions to an acceptable level.\r\n3 years after, Im still in this marriage and I now feel depressed, unhappy and easy prey to wiswas. I feel I have wasted my best young years of pointless games where I instead should have been courteous stronger and wiser in our religion.\r\n\r\nIslam is the key to happiness and purification of the soul and I had hoped he had helped me through difficult times by following the word of Allah. I am disappointedand Unhappy and only think about divorce. \r\nI have endured so long and avoided divorce because I know Allah dislikes Divorce, but on the other how do I come closer to Allah by carrying on in this marriage.

This has led to strong rumours circulating among people and the husband is living in isolation; no one visits him, not even his brothers, because of these rumours. When he confronted his wife she denied it vehemently and did not speak to him for several days, even though when the disputes between him and her family grow intense, she behaves in a manner that causes him to have doubts about her and there are times when the husband believes these rumours and times when he thinks that they are untrue.

I live with my parents in law since I got married. I started my marriage life hoping that we build a family, and that they treat me like their daughter and I will do the same. But the relationship with them became &ldquo;peaceful coexistence&rdquo;, they may be a conversation so long as they do not criticise me. I do really miss the feeling of being beloved, especially when I am ill or tired. I do not feel that she cares about my health like a mother does. If I get tired she does not ask how I feel or if I feel any better, so I just do not say that I am tired any more. Sometimes she makes me feel like if I am just acting or pretending to be ill, and this really hurts me. As I do not ask to rest while she does what the home needs of cleaning, cooking etc. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe other problem is the nature of my mother in law. She always criticises others&rsquo; actions, she is right about some things sometimes, and sometimes she just magnifies. She wants everything to happen in accordance with her desire; otherwise it is wrong, in her view. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe problem is that she mostly criticises friends, her relatives or mine. She sometimes gives really sharp critique especially when she is angry, it becomes nearly like slandering. I feel we commit much of gheebah (backbiting). If I do not answer her or if I try to justify the other&rsquo;s situation she becomes angry with me. She is only pleased when I say she is right and the other side is wrong. But so we hurt many people by this gheebah. &nbsp;What deepens my sadness is when this criticising is about my family (my father, mother brothers, and their wives). She sometimes is right about what she says, but they are humans and they do mistakes.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nShe does not only badly criticise a specific manner that made her angry in some situation, she talks about their personal life. If I show her that what she says annoys me, she becomes angry with me. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy father in law passed away less than a year ago, and this made it even worse. She became very sensitive to any word or action of anyone we know. She even criticises me, every matter in our life she criticises; my way with her son (my husband), my children and my family. She wants me to blame my family for everything she thinks is wrong. Now I see that my brother complements her (for my sake), and even if she gets angry with anyone of them he comes and apologises. Is not this enough for me to confess their complement, as they could easily leave it but they are just apologising to her for my sake.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs an example of what I am saying: my husband travelled for 10 days. My family was calling everyday to ask about us and if we need anything. But she criticised this saying that one of them should have come to us everyday to see if we want to go to anywhere etc. then the appointment of her weekly injection came. So my brother in law came and took us to the hospital, then took us to buy what we need for home. But she still criticised his behaviour saying that he should have bought something for my children who were with us. And she became very angry and said that he is stingy.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs for me, she criticises me a lot especially recently. Sometimes she uses really hurtful words in front of my children. All these years I am just patient, I did not say a word or object to anything, respect for her and seeking my husband&rsquo;s satisfaction. I always renew my intention considering all this for Allah&rsquo;s sake. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI feel I cannot tolerate it anymore. This has affected my health and made me very hot tempered with my children. I know this is the only way out to release my anger.  I try my best to stop this or avoid it but I cannot. I do not feel that I have my private marriage life. There is no time to be alone with my husband. As I always sit with her and talk so that she does not feel lonely. I try not to let the conversation be about someone, so I just make it about general matters or religious issues. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI do not spend time with my children to play; they are 9 and 6 years old. I do not that I have a home I am free in. As I have to ask for her permission before doing anything. She thinks I have no say in any matter and I cannot do anything alone, until I became really like this. What shall I do? I am doing everything within my ability to satisfy her. I do not feel I am at my home, I feel just like a guest who must be careful about what to do what should not be done all the time. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI have talked about this to my husband. He said that this is her nature and we should not consider it just as if she does this only with us. As she behaves in the same way with all people, relative or stranger person, all the same. He said I should not let it be burden on myself psychologically. To be honest I could not understand quite well this theory or cope with it. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI became just like &ldquo;intense electricity&rdquo;, I store pressure during the day and release it by crying all night so that I maybe able to tolerate the next day. I keep pressing on myself to accept what she says and show no annoyance of what she says about others, I feel very guilty as it is gheebah, or about my family, which hurts me even more. I just try to repress my anger and be extremely diplomatic trying to defend who she is making gheebah of. And I try my best to avoid her being angry with me because of me doing this. Sometimes I really fail to do both things at the same time, which makes her angry.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI lost all my friends, I preferred to be far from them before marriage so that she may not criticise me, and also because I cannot complement them as I used to do before marriage, as I cannot go out to meet them but by her permission. Even visiting my family, we must use a trick somehow to make her say visit them herself. I am not free to go out with my husband anytime. In case we go out alone, we find her angry when we come back, and it becomes very obvious even to my husband that she is angry as we went out alone. I do not find any other reason for her anger although we ask for her permission before we go out. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband does not have friends to socialise with. All the relationships are within work or they may meet outside without their families. We had very few relationships with his friends&rsquo; families and all finished because she keeps criticising every behaviour of his friend or his family. So we do not have any relationships with any family, while I am from a family who values the social life a lot. My mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s friends are increasing over years. I think they both are righteous. They brought us up memorising quran and praying. They taught us that they good companions are very important in everyone&rsquo;s life. That is why I feel emptiness in this side of my life and I do not know how to make up.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI want to have good companions but I fear it increases my problems with my mother in law, what shall I do? I feel that I just cannot keep on. At the same time I do not want to spoil the best years in my children&rsquo;s life by shouting at them. My ability to understand and appreciate is all used to absorb my mother in law&rsquo;s anger. Anyway she is my husband&rsquo;s mother; he should be good to her as I should respect her. But I feel that I won&rsquo;t be able to tolerate more. Am I mistaken? Will I use the reward of patience by complaining to my husband or by directing my anger onto my children? &nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf I ask my husband to specify sometime for us to spend it together or to go out, will this be considered disrespect or disobedience to her? How can I avoid falling into gheebah? Is it enough to denounce it by my heart and try to defend who she makes gheebah of so that I do not feel guilty of this sin and cause no problem for myself with her at the same time? If I have to answer her, can I say what satisfies her while my heart hates saying it, then ask Allah privately to forgive them? Will I be considered sinful?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI am not just doing what I should with her or at home to not feel guilty, but it is not of pure love. I hoped I could feel as if I am her daughter. But this cannot happen from one side only. As the other side must feel the same as well. Am I sinful then to treat her well only because of the womb relation and respecting the old? &nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrankly I do not feel it is my home.

I hated mixing and I hated the fact that we had no interest in our religion. No day passed when I did not read Soorat al-Baqarah, Aal &lsquo;Imraan, al-Rahmaan and Yaa-Seen, and recite a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and tasbeeh. I felt that I was better than my friends and the girls of my generation, and I felt that I was close to our Lord, and I had tranquillity and peace of mind.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDuring all this I refused everyone who came to propose marriage, because they were far away from religion and were not committed; they drank alcohol and did many other things that I feel too embarrassed to mention.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSometimes those who regarded my mentality as backward would say: You are beautiful and you appear modern, but you are not enjoying your life and you are backward in your thinking like our grandmothers&rsquo; grandmothers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYet despite that my faith in Allaah was great and I was strong in the face of all the temptations of life. I found myself in many difficult situations but every time, I chose to be close to our Lord and I overcame my self that is inclined towards evil, praise be to Allaah.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor the first time I felt that I needed a righteous, religiously-committed husband. I felt that work and study were taking up all my time, but I needed to find a marriage partner and form a family and have children.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn order to protect myself against the group who I was with in a foreign country, I put on hijab and went to pray in the mosque, and this was for the first time in my life, but they were the happiest \r\ndays of my life, a wonderful experience.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI realized how far I was falling short in my religious commitment, and how ignorant I was about many things in my religion, and how awful and how faraway from religion our society is. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut when I went back to our country I took off the hijab due to social, professional and political reasons, but I felt even more alienated and I felt very depressed.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll the people think that I have changed a great deal, most of all my family, and because of that and in order to get me out of the state I am in, they decided to go for &lsquo;umrah at the time of the Prophet&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPraise be to Allaah, I went, with my father, mother and sister, and it was an indescribable delight. I enjoyed praying in al-Rawdah al-Shareef (the area between the Prophet&rsquo;s minbar and grave) and I enjoyed praying and making du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in Makkah, and I enjoyed the conservative Saudi society. I enjoyed wearing the niqaab and abayah, as I have never enjoyed anything else. Those were some of the happiest days of my life.&nbsp;\r\nWhen I came back to my country, I took off the hijab. I had no choice but to follow the ways of my society, because of the demands of my job, i.e., meetings with men. I have no choice but to shake hands, and dress as they dress. I work all day until 6 p.m., then I go home and pray Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr and Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; all together, because at work we have no time or space to ourselves. Even the places where we could do wudoo&rsquo; are mixed. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI feel sick and tired, and I feel that my faith is very weak, and I am afraid of fitnah (temptation).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI cannot get married and I cannot live, I cannot do my religious duties and I feel alienated. Either I live like the rest of the people and accept an immoral evildoer (as a husband) &ndash; please excuse these words &ndash; or I leave this country where everything is detestable.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI have no objection to marrying someone from outside my country and leaving my country, so long as he is religiously committed and will help me to obey Allaah.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI have been to all the marriage websites on the internet and this is my last hope.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe problem now is that I have stopped praying and I have stopped reading Qur&rsquo;aan because I feel that I am living a life of hypocrisy.

We divorced 5 years ago because he was cold and cruel to me. A few months later he promised he would not behave that way anymore and that he loved me, so I went back to him because we had one son at that time and he seemed sincere. A few months after marrying again, he had a girlfriend that I found out about. I was going to leave him, but a family friend talked me into staying for our son. So I did. He continued to chase women for years. He would say that he was going to sleep at the masjid and would instead sleep at his girlfriend's house. We live in Canada and there is not a huge muslim community here, so men do not sleep in the masjid, except during Ramadan. I was raised as a Christian and reverted to Islam only one month before I found out about his last girlfriend. He was with her for a solid 2.5 years before I found out about her. I have been muslim for one year now, Alhamdullillah! I love Islam and try to live my life according to the Qur'an and Sunnah. We have another son who is now 2.5 years old. After finding out about this girlfriend he has had for such a long time and how he lied to her and me both, I approached the Imam to get help in trying to change my husband's behaviour. The Imam gave me lots of proof from the Qur'an and Sunnah to give to my husband and none of it was affective. My husband talks about Islam beautifully when it suits his agenda, but his actions show that Islam does not light up his heart. He did not want to give up his girlfriend. He even went so far as to lie to the Imam and I while sitting in the masjid about ending the relationship with her, when he really had no intention of doing it. The woman herself told me that he was still coming to see her. We have gone through marriage counselling for months, and my husband continued to lie and stay with his girlfriend. So while in a counselling session in the masjid, I told him and the Imam that I wanted a divorce. My husband said that he would give me a divorce but wasn't ready to say it that day. He wanted to come back to the Imam two days later and say it. So he did that - he came back two days later and told the Imam that he divorces me (using my name). My husband became abusive while I was waiting out my iddah, so the Imam talked to him and tried to get him to understand that in Islam he must treat me kindly, even when divorcing me. Eventually, the Imam helped me to find a family to stay with for a week to give us some space while he tried to convince my husband to stop the abuse. After the week was over, the Imam suggested I go back home to wait out my iddah. So I did. The abuse was worse and I could only endure it for 3 more weeks. Then I moved in with my friend and her family (sister is Islam). From there, I had to go to a women's shelter (government housing with high security for women fleeing violence in the home) because he was causing so much trouble and had become dangerous. I have prayed istikhara before leaving him, and at every stage of this situation that required a serious decision, and therefore believe that Allah has chosen this path for me. I believe this with all of my heart because some of my du'as have been answered immediately and Allah has provided for me everything that I have needed at every step thorughout this process. I thank Allah everyday that he has made me a muslim and that he has helped me through this very difficult time. I do not believe that my husband has any interest in changing his behaviour and I will not spend my life with someone who doesn't understand the seriousness of lying and adultery and who does not fear Allah. But I do make du'a that Allah will guide him back to the straight path so that he may be a good example for our boys and one day enter Jannah, inshaAllah. I apologize for the lengthly introduction, but it was necessary. I am thinking about the idea of getting married again, inshaAllah. So, my question is: Do you think it would be a good decision to ask the Imam to marry me? The reason I am asking is because he is a very pious man, mashaAllah. Throughout the marriage counselling and his support to me and my children while we were living in the women's shelter I have seen that he fears Allah and is very compassionate, kind, gentle, intelligent, empathetic, very honest, trustworthy, and enjoys the beauty of Islam. I have watched his halaqas on the internet (which he records in the masjid) and can see that he sees, and is moved by, the signs Allah has given to us in this world. I have always felt like I am a stranger in this world because people, especially here in Canada, don't notice the signs around them and don't appreciate what Allah has provided for them. And if I am going to marry again, I would like to marry someone who will teach me more about the beauty of Islam, not make it harder for me to maintain my iman. The Imam shows qualities that I would like in a husband - ones that I didn't have with my previous husband. There are two other points that motivate me to get your advice, and they are: 1) The Imam is married already (with 3 children) and multiple marriages are illegal in Canada. But people get married in the masjid and don't let the government know. 2) My former husband accused the Imam of divorcing us so that he could marry me. My former husband went to the masjid and spread lies about this Imam to the other Imam and the community. Once the other Imam investigated, he found that the Imam that helped me did nothing wrong or inappropriate and that my former husband was fabricating stories to defame him because he was angry with him for helping me. So, you can see my dilemma. I am torn between the desire for a pious husband with the Imam's qualities and not wanting the Imam's (or my) honour and reputation to be destroyed (considering the previous allegations). I do not even know if the Imam would be willing to marry me or not - I have not spoken a word of this to anyone, including him, and he has not done anything to make me feel like he is interested. I just wanted to get the opinion of someone from the outside who is objective and knowledgeable in Islam to tell me what they think of the idea of asking him to marry me. In Canada, we are raised with the idea that multiple marriages are severely wrong, yet I understand now why people do it. If I see a man who is a very good muslim and tries his best to follow the example of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) then I would consider being a second wife rather than take a chance on someone I don't know. I do not want another abusive relationship. Here, in Canada, people also date before marriage (as I'm sure you know) but now that I am a muslim I won't date. So the idea of marrying someone I don't know is scary. I am in a position now where I have to choose very carefully the man I may marry and I do not have muslim family members to help me in that decision. My whole family is Christian, and they will think I am crazy to agree to be a second wife. They already think that I'm not thinking straight because I reverted to Islam. I consider all of the negative aspects of marrying him and think that I should find some other man to marry, but then I think of Jannah, and how much I want to make it there, inshaAllah, and know that the Imam will help me to be the best muslim I can be and will treat me well. In conclusion, please give me your advice on this situation and tell me if you think I should ask the Imam to marry me or ask him to be my wali and help me find another man with as many of his good qualities as possible and trust that Allah will provide a good husband for me. May Allah bless you abundantly for your patience in reading this lengthly email and for the advice you give me, inshaAllah. May he use you to guide me in his intended direction.","question_url":"\/en\/126264","question_no":"126264","status":"done"},{"id":"10391","category_id":"426","question":"She married an American man who announced his Islam, then he stopped praying and denied that Allah created the heavens.

My parents have a sufistic Qadriyanni belief in which they belief the Prophet Mohammed S.A.W was a Noor and a human.

I would like to know if this form of Ibadah is in accordance with the Sunnah. If the Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W) ever recited it. My parents want me to do the Ibadah with them and they get very angry even if i question it the slightest bit because they say what do you know your so young. The alim who came has been studying for more then 60 years who are you to question them. So brother please answer my question in as much depth as possible and as much proof you can possibly have if this Dua is sunnah or just an innovation. As well i forgot to mention there is this other thing my parents want me to do after i do this supplication &nbsp;\r\nwhich is that i recite Surah 105 in the Quran and when it gets to a part where you say tarmihim to say tarmeem and take these rocks one by one bouncing them off of a metal bowl turned upside down covered with a red sheet to represent blood.

They do a lot of bidah that includes asking wasillah, teaching acts mentioned above, celebrate milad in nabi and I can keep going on for ages. Is it permissible to pray behind those imams who teaches such things? \r\nSometimes, when I try to talk to them, whether they get angry and they do not reason and give sahih daleel to their arguments. They always say that some alims taught them and they are better than us and we should follow them without question. We are facing this diellma to either be quiet and allow them to follow what they will. \r\n\r\nSometimes it ends in quarrel and at times ruins relationships\/friendship.... because as much as we try they always say that the alim is far better and knows what he is preaching.\r\n\r\nFinally, what should I do to explain my family and friends?.","question_url":"\/en\/187877","question_no":"187877","status":"done"},{"id":"10498","category_id":"249","question":"Bid\u2018ah of Sha\u2018baan.","question_full":"What is Shab e Baraat that is celebrated by many South Asian Muslims?","question_url":"\/en\/154850","question_no":"154850","status":"done"},{"id":"10499","category_id":"249","question":"Is it permissible to celebrate the night of the fifteenth of Sha\u2018baan and to distribute sweets to children to let people know that Ramadan is approaching?.","question_full":"Is it permissible to celebrate the night of the fifteenth of Sha&lsquo;baan, as it is a part of the people&rsquo;s heritage in some countries?

Five years ago we committed the crime of buying our house through an interest based mortgage from a local bank here. Relying on many fatawa of scholars here (may Allah forgive them!).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTwo years ago Allah guided us to Islam like if we just knew it. Recently, some Islamic (as they claim) financing companies here started to appear.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe following is an explanation of their way to convert an interest based mortgage to Islamic financing, based on cooperating: the Islamic company deals with a bank that deals with interest to finance their project. This Islamic company says that its relationship with the bank is not a Riba relation, it is a trade relation. \r\n\r\nThis company values the house in the local market; an appointed person licensed by the government does this valuation matter.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe monthly amount I have to pay is based on the rest of the loan I took and the profit which is about 4.9%.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome of this monthly amount I pay goes as profit, and the rest is to be discounted from the actual price of the house. The Islamic financing company&rsquo;s share is the difference between the price of the house now and what is remaining to be paid of the interest-based loan. The company evaluates the price of the house every one, two or five years. Their share of profit changes according to the number of years I choose. This means that the nisbah of profit is fixed, but the share of every one of us gets evaluated every few years.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat remains of the mortgage (their share of the house) is $178.000, their profit in the first five years is 49038.88$, and I own of the house what equals 18408.08$ of the house which cost is $178.000.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the company and the bank is unclear. It depends in its essence on buying money with money; as they did not buy the house formally. All these transactions are only on paper between the company and the bank. The house actually has nothing to do with these transactions except that it is mentioned on papers between the two sides.

PBSC donors receive daily injections of a drug called filgrastim for five days, to increase the number of blood-forming cells in the bloodstream.

I am almost ready to embrace Islam however I have two major problems. First I am\r\n      married to a Christian, he drinks a lot and is out of work at this stage, when he drinks I\r\n      become someone I do not like very much. I do not drink at all and have not for several\r\n      years. My father was an alcoholic and unfortunately I also married one. I loved him very much when we got married however he has slowly destroyed\r\n      this love with his manners and attitude. I do like him, when he is sober he is the kindest\r\n      and most giving person I know and he would do almost anything for his friends and I think\r\n      for his family. We have 2 children but they are both very fed up with his drinking. If I\r\n      had to leave him, he will most definitely land up in the gutter. He will not be able to\r\n      cope on his own. He has a very low self-esteem at this stage. I am very helpless at this\r\n      stage and do not know what to do. My second major problem is I am friends with a much younger Muslim man. We\r\n      have known each other for a couple of years now and I have also come to love him. The\r\n      major problem here is he is married and has two children, he is much younger than what I\r\n      am and he is friends with my husband and I am friends with his wife. I have never\r\n      indicated to him how I feel or what I feel, but I do dream a lot of what may be. I know\r\n      this is probably wrong. I am not the type of person who will leave my husband for another\r\n      man but we have not had a proper marriage relationship for almost six years now and I am\r\n      not dead yet. I would like to embrace Islam but I am afraid that my friend's attitude\r\n      may change towards me when I become a Muslimah, we now visit and talk about almost\r\n      anything ranging from business to religion and I would not like to loose his friendship by\r\n      committing myself.

I am interested in it because I am in a Religious Studies class\r\n      and I am interested in learning more. I just wanted to know your response to this,if I am correct in saying this...In Islam heaven is thought of as paradise of wine, women and song. It is\r\n      achieved by living a life in which, ironically, one abstains from the things with which he\r\n      or she will be rewarded in paradise. In addition to this abstentiion, one must follow the\r\n      five Pillars of Islam. It seems to me that the Islamic faith is a do-it-yourself proposition.Follow this &quot;way of life&quot;, they say, and you will gain favor\r\n      with God and eventually achieve salvation. There is NO assurance. I would hate to live\r\n      like that. I realize that Muslims do not believe in &quot;original sin&quot;, but\r\n      regardless of wether or not a man is born sinful or not, would you not agree that every\r\n      man\/woman is sinful? How does one pay for his\/her sin?I understand repentance. I agree with that...but it seems as though one\r\n      can NEVER do enough to win favor with God. That is why He sent his Son to die for us. All\r\n      of our sins past present and future.There is no possibility of assurance in the Islamic faith. I think that\r\n      would be an awful way to live knowing that I was never gonna make it...not knowing of my\r\n      salvation until the &quot;day of judgement&quot; whether or not I have done enough\r\n      &quot;goodworks&quot; or prayed enough...etc.I have asked a couple of Muslims in my class whether or not they were for\r\n      sure if they were going to &quot;paradise&quot; or &quot;heaven&quot; when they died. I\r\n      have not yet had one reply in the affirmative. Rather, they referred to the imperfection\r\n      of their lives as being a barrier to this realization. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE IN ISLAM,\r\n      BECAUSE THERE IS NO ATONEMENT, AND SALVATION DEPENDS WHOLLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S GAINING\r\n      &nbsp; ENOUGH &quot;MERIT&quot;Aslo, if I wanted to become a Muslim, I couldn't. If Muslims think that\r\n      they are the &quot;chosen people&quot; then why aren't they spreading their faith.Do you just have to be lucky enough to be born Muslim? If a person wants\r\n      to become a Christian they can. ANYONE can become a Christian in a matter of seconds. All\r\n      they have to do is confess that Jesus Christ is who He said He was and repent and\r\n      believe...that is all a lot easier said than done. But basically that is it. I wasn't born\r\n      Christian...or raised Christians assert that Jesus Chrit is the only way to God becauseScritpture says, &quot;Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no\r\n      other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. (Acts 4:12) Jesus Christ\r\n      said himself\r\n      &quot;I am the way the truth and the life, NO ONE comes to the Father\r\n      except through me...&quot;He didn't say, I am one way or a way or one truth etc....THE WAY!!!I and the Father are ONE!

I truly mean no disrespect. I write because I have been considering in accepting Allah as my only God. However, I find myself confused and this is why I seek your advice. Up until almost a year ago I attended a Baptist church and became a Christian. When I made this decision I changed my life for the better. I stop drinking, I married the father of my daughter and changed the type of music a listened to and what clothing I wore. I also changed my way of thinking and began to pray to God all the times. It seemed as if I had finally found the path God had intended for me. Three years after that, my Dad became gravely ill with cancer. During my time of sorrow my church family was nowhere to be found and I was left alone to suffer in sorrow and alone. I prayed besides my Dad death bed begging God to give me strength and comfort. I truly believe if it wasn't for my praying I would of went crazy just sitting there watching a listening to my Dad scream and cry with pain while slowly dying. When my Dad died in December I was very sad but also happy because I had prayed to God to end his suffering even if it meant taking him from us. During this time I did not receive any comfort from the church family nor a gesture of sympathy (card, flowers etc). All I got was a text message from one of them that they were praying for me. Till this day I still have not gotten a call or a visit from any of them. Because my heart was hurt and I was angry with their actions or lack off I stop going to church. I ran into one of them at a store a few weeks ago and they pretended to not see me although they looked at me straight in my face. My daughter who is 7 yrs old was with me and was hurt due to the ladies actions. During my time at the church I gave my tithes, attended ALL church functions and was always there for a fellow Christian. My husband and I made it a point to teach our daughter the teachings of the New King James Bible and what God expects from us. I can't help but feel angry at them and think that Baptists are hypocrites and all around fake. Nowhere in the Bible it read&rsquo;s that you turn your back on your brothers\/sisters. I did nothing to shame myself, family or God. So, why did they treat me that way? Now I rarely pray and I constantly think about what faith is true to Gods words and teachings. My relationship with my husband is just there. We have been together for 20 years and just married 3 yrs and I don&rsquo;t see myself in his eyes nor does he pay attention to me no matter how much I try to attract him. He almost never wants to have intercourse with me and is always on the computer till 3 am every night. I try so hard to do everything for him and go beyond what he needs just to keep him happy but it never works. We barely talk and I just feel that we are together for our daughter&rsquo;s sake and nothing more. Lately, satan has been working on me because now I look and think of other men other than my husband especially a Muslim man that works at my job and has shown (respectful) kindness to me. I fear to going back to the life I had before I became Christian and I fear the wrath of God. I have been reading on Islam culture, religious beliefs etc. and wondered if this is God&rsquo;s true path for me. Please believe me when I say that wanting to accept Allah has NOTHING to do with this Muslim man but everything to do with fear of getting lost in the worldly things again. Can I be accepted into the Islam faith although I&rsquo;m Hispanic (from Puerto Rico & Venezuela), have had a child out of marriage 7 yrs ago and am I Baptist Christian? And is it true that a woman like me is seen as damaged goods to a Muslim man therefore even if my husband and I were to divorce there could never be any relationship between me and a Muslim man?

A Muslim sister answered me with \"No\" because I am not a virgin in addition that dating is not allowed in Islam. I am feeling badly as I love him much and respect his religion.

I am a nineteen-year-old male. Allah has blessed me with religious commitment, and I am a seeker of knowledge and a Haafiz of His holy Book. But my problem is that I suffer from the pressure of desire, which has led to the appearance of localised pain in the testicles (which is sometimes very severe) and difficulty in urination. I asked a Muslim doctor over the Internet and described the symptoms to him in detail. He told me that I am suffering from vasocongestion because of ongoing provocation and lack of draining of the fluids. Then he told me that in the event of increased provocation I have to masturbate so as to remove this congestion.

I feel very ashamed of myself, especially because people look at me with respect. I have been living with a bitter psychological conflict because of this matter, because sometimes I feel that my intention is not pure when I engage in this habit.
