If the purchaser agrees to pay a higher price in return for delaying \r\n    payment, the transaction is valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; al-Bukhaari (2086) narrated that Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah when they used to pay \r\n    in advance the price of fruits to be delivered within two or three years. He said, &ldquo;Whoever pays in advance the price of a thing to be delivered \r\n    later should pay it for a specified measure at specified weight for a specified period.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Bay&rsquo; al-salam (forward buying) is permissible \r\n    according to the texts and scholarly consensus, and it is akin to purchase by installments. The scholars mentioned that the wisdom behind it is \r\n    that it benefits the purchaser by reducing the price and the vendor by bringing him money sooner. This indicates that something may be added to \r\n    the price in return for delaying payment, and that there is nothing wrong with this when buying and selling. See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 6\/385.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The actions of the Muslims indicate that \r\n    it is permissible to increase the price in return for delaying payment, and none of them denounced that. So it became like consensus (<i>ijma&rsquo;<\/i>) \r\n    that this kind of transaction is permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about the ruling on \r\n    increasing the price in return for delaying payment, He said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is nothing wrong with this transaction \r\n    because paying cash for the product is different from delaying payment. The Muslims are still doing such transactions and this is like consensus \r\n    that it is permissible. Some scholars held an odd opinion and said that it is not permissible to increase the price in return for delaying \r\n    payment, and they thought that this was a kind of riba, but this is a baseless view. It is not a kind of riba at all, because when the dealer \r\n    sells the product to be paid for later, he agrees to the delay so that he may benefit from the increase in price, and the purchaser agrees to the \r\n    increase so that he may take his time and because he is unable to pay the price in cash on the spot. So both of them benefit from this \r\n    transaction. There is a proven report from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which indicates that this is permissible; \r\n    he commanded &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr ibn al-&lsquo;Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) to equip an army and\r\n    <span>he was buying one camel \r\n    for two camels, to be handed over at a later date<\/span>. Moreover this transaction comes under the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;O you who believe! When you contract a debt \r\n    for a fixed period, write it down&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Baqarah 2:282]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This transaction is one of the permissible \r\n    kinds of debt that are mentioned in this verse; it is also akin to forward buying (bay&rsquo; al-salam).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, \r\n    2\/331&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>See <i>Bay&rsquo; al-Tasqeet<\/i> by Dr. Rafeeq \r\n    Yoonus al-Masri&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8003","question_id":"8003","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      There is no set limit to which a trader must adhere in the \r\n      profits he makes on his business, but if the goods have a known market \r\n      value, it is not permissible for him to cheat the buyer by selling goods \r\n      to him for more than the usual market value and taking advantage of his \r\n      ignorance. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n      blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Do not meet incoming traders and \r\n      whoever meets them and buys from them, when the trader reaches the \r\n      marketplace he has the choice (of annulling the transaction).&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n      Muslim, 1519.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam gives the trader the choice, when he reaches the \r\n    marketplace, because the one who met him probably cheated him and bought \r\n    from him at a price other than the market value.

We have stated that our view is that it is not valid, \r\n    whether the guardian gives permission or not. This is also the view of Abu \r\n    Thawr. Al-Thawri, Abu Haneefah, Ahmad and Ishaaq said: It is valid (for a \r\n    child) to buy and sell with his guardian&rsquo;s permission. It was narrated from \r\n    Abu Haneefah that he regarded it as permissible without the guardian&rsquo;s \r\n    permission. Ibn al-Mundhir said: Ahmad and Ishaaq regarded it as permissible \r\n    (for a child) to buy and sell for a small amount, i.e., without permission. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i> (4\/168): It is valid for a child who has reached the age of \r\n    discernment to engage in transactions by buying and selling, if his guardian \r\n    has given permission for that, according to one of the two reports. This is \r\n    also the view of Abu Haneefah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second view is that it \r\n    is not valid until the child reaches puberty, which is the view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because he is not accountable, therefore he is more like the \r\n    one who has not reached the age of discernment, and because discernment \r\n    cannot be defined as a certain age, therefore the Lawgiver has set a \r\n    guideline for that, namely puberty. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We also have the words of \r\n    Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And try orphans (as regards \r\n    their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find \r\n    sound judgement <span>in them, release their \r\n    property to them<\/span>&rdquo; [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:6]<\/i>. What this means is test them to \r\n    see if they are mature and wise, and testing them is done by delegating them \r\n    to buy and sell, so that it may be determined whether they will be cheated \r\n    or not. If he is wise and has discernment, under the care of a guardian, \r\n    then his transactions with the permission of his guardian are valid, like a \r\n    slave. This is different from the case of one who has no discernment; no \r\n    interest can be served by his engaging in transactions, because he has no \r\n    discernment or knowledge, and there is no need to test him, because his \r\n    condition is known.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They say that it is not \r\n    possible to know the age at which a person reaches discernment. We say that \r\n    may be known by seeing his behaviour and attitude, as it may be known in the \r\n    case of an adult. Knowing that he is mature and of sound mind is a condition \r\n    of giving him his own wealth, and of the validity of his transactions, and \r\n    the same applies here.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to transactions \r\n    done without the permission of his guardian, his transactions are not valid, \r\n    but they may be valid, subject to the approval of his guardian. This is the \r\n    view of Abu Haneefah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for a child who has not \r\n    reached the age of discernment, his transactions are not valid, even if his \r\n    guardian gives him permission, except in the case of small amounts, as it \r\n    was narrated from Abu&rsquo;l-Darda&rsquo; that he bought a small bird from a boy and \r\n    let it go. This was narrated by Ibn Abi Moosa. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up: the transactions \r\n    of a child, buying and selling, may be valid in two cases:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; If it has to do with \r\n    something small, in which case it is valid even if he has not reached the \r\n    age of discernment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; If it is done with the \r\n    permission of his guardian.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Small thing means a (small) \r\n    loaf of bread, or a piece of candy and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>Mataalib Ooli \r\n    al-Nuha<\/i> (3\/10): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Except for something small, \r\n    such as a small loaf of bread, a bunch of herbs or a piece of candy and so \r\n    on. &hellip; Otherwise, if the guardian of the child who has reached the age of \r\n    discernment or the fool gives them permission, then the transaction is valid \r\n    &ndash; even if it concerns a large amount &ndash; because Allaah says &ldquo;<i>And try \r\n    orphans (as regards their intelligence)<\/i>&rdquo;.

Abu \r\n    Hurayrah said: You have made permissible the selling of sakks [sakk: a \r\n    letter from the ruler ordering that food and other items be given to a \r\n    certain person].

But the one who buys it does not have \r\n    the right to sell it until after he has taken possession of the food. This \r\n    is the view of the Maalikis and Shaafa&rsquo;is.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That all people are forbidden to sell it before taking \r\n    possession of it. This is the view of Imam Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>al-Muntaqa<\/i> by al-Baaji (4\/284); <i>Haashiyat \r\n    al-Dasooqi<\/i> (3\/151); <i>al-Qawaa&rsquo;id<\/i> by Ibn Rajab (p.84); <i>\r\n    al-Muhadhdhab ma&rsquo;a al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (9\/328).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Sharh \r\n    Muslim<\/i>: The sakk is a document that represents something that is owed. \r\n    What is meant here is the document that is issued by the governor for food, \r\n    which entitled a person to such and such of food or other goods, which the \r\n    owner sells to that person before taking possession of it. The scholars \r\n    differed concerning that, but the more correct view according to our \r\n    companions and others is that it is permissible to sell them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Those who disallowed it based that on the apparent \r\n    meaning of the words of Abu Hurayrah and his argument, whereas those who \r\n    allowed it interpreted the case of Abu Hurayrah as meaning that the one who \r\n    bought the sakk from the one to whom it was issued sold it to a third party, \r\n    before the buyer took full possession of it, so the prohibition applies to \r\n    the second sale, not the&nbsp; first, because the one to whom it was issued was \r\n    the owner and was not a buyer, so he was not forbidden to sell it before \r\n    taking possession of it, just as it is not forbidden to sell what one \r\n    inherits before taking possession of it. al-Qaadi Iyaad said, after \r\n    explaining it in a similar manner: They used to trade in them, and the buyer \r\n    would sell them before taking possession of them, so they were forbidden to \r\n    do that. He said: News of that reached &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab and he rejected \r\n    it and said: Do not sell food until you have taken full possession of it. \r\n    End quote.

There is a clearer report in al-Muwatta&rsquo; which says that Hakeen ibn \r\n    Hizaam bought food concerning which &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) had issued a document, and Hakeem sold the food that he \r\n    bough before he took possession of it.

This varies from \r\n    one situation, person, place and time to another. It is proven in <i>Saheeh \r\n    Muslim<\/i> in the hadeeth of &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \r\n    when Jibreel asked him about the signs of the Hour: &ldquo;When you see the \r\n    barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in the construction of lofty \r\n    buildings.&rdquo; Ibn Rajab said, commenting on this hadeeth: What is meant is \r\n    that the lowest of the people will become their leaders, and their wealth \r\n    will increase, until they compete in building tall buildings, and adorning \r\n    them. Al-Nawawi mentioned the same meaning in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, \r\n    where he discussed this hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to making a building tall for a legitimate \r\n    purpose, such as to provide facilities and accommodation for the needy, or \r\n    as a means of earning money, or because one has a lot of dependents and the \r\n    like, there is nothing wrong with that as far as we can see, because things \r\n    are to be judged by their purpose. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Actions are but by intention, and every man will \r\n    have but that which he intended.&rdquo; This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari \r\n    and Muslim in their <i>Saheehs<\/i> from &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq &lsquo;Afeefi, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    Ghadyaan, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Munay&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> \r\n    (4\/490).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have been told that every deed of the son of Adam will be \r\n    rewarded except building a house. Is this correct? If it is correct, what is \r\n    the reason? Please mention the hadeeth in which it was narrated. May Allaah \r\n    reward you with good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, this was narrated concerning a man who spent his money \r\n    extravagantly on mud, i.e., in building that which he had no need for. As \r\n    for building that which a person needs, it is one of the necessities of \r\n    life, and if a person spends on himself for the necessities of life, he will \r\n    be rewarded for that if he spends it seeking thereby the Countenance of \r\n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. But showing off and competing in \r\n    constructing tall buildings is something in which there is nothing good, \r\n    rather it is nothing but a waste of money. As for that which a person builds \r\n    because he needs it, he will be rewarded for that, if he seeks thereby the \r\n    Countenance of Allaah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said to Sa&rsquo;d ibn Abi Waqqaas: &ldquo;Know that you will never \r\n    spend anything seeking thereby the Countenance of Allaah, but you will be \r\n    rewarded for it, even (the food) that you put in your wife&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Liqa&rsquo; al-Shahri<\/i> (15\/question \r\n    no. 6).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the ahaadeeth and comments of the scholars \r\n    concerning this issue in the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]21658[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence you may know the ruling on building the house that your \r\n    wife wants you to buy for them, and we will sum that up for you in the \r\n    following points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is not permissible to buy a \r\n    house with money from haraam sources such as riba-based loans or wealth that \r\n    was unlawfully seized.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>&nbsp;There is no reward for simply \r\n    building a house, but if the owner intends to shelter his family and protect \r\n    them from heat and cold, he will be rewarded for his intention, not just for \r\n    the house itself.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is not permissible for a \r\n    Muslim to build or buy a house with the intention of boasting and showing \r\n    off, and if he does that then he is sinning.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>There is no reason why the \r\n    house should not have a pool or garden, but that is subject to the condition \r\n    that it should not be extravagance or going to extremes with regard to the \r\n    size and price of the house.

When \r\n    something is rented, that means that the usage or benefits of the item (and \r\n    not the item itself) are transferred to the renter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Selling something implies that the purchaser both owns the \r\n    item itself and enjoys usage of it, and if it is worn out or destroyed he \r\n    bears the cost of that and the loss of both the item and its benefits; none \r\n    of that falls upon the seller. But if something is rented, the owner who is \r\n    renting it out bears the cost of any loss or any wear or tear to the item or \r\n    its benefits, unless the renter has transgressed the limits or shown \r\n    negligence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: The rental fees are calculated on a yearly or \r\n    monthly basis in such a way that towards the end of the state term, the \r\n    value of the item is paid off, but the seller calls these payments &ldquo;rental \r\n    fees&rdquo; so that the purchaser cannot not sell the item until he has paid the \r\n    whole amount. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: If the value of the item in question is fifty \r\n    thousand riyals and the monthly rent is usually one thousand riyals, he \r\n    makes it two thousand. In fact this is part of the price until, towards the \r\n    end of the term, the value of the item is paid. But if the purchaser is \r\n    unable to make the final payment, for example, the item will be taken away \r\n    from him on the grounds that it is something rented, and he will not be \r\n    given back the money that he has paid on the grounds that he has made use of \r\n    it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obvious that this is wrongdoing and forcing people to \r\n    borrow money to make the last payment. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: This kind of contract leads to the poor being \r\n    careless about debts until many of them end up heavily in debt.

Based on this, the bank does not have the right to sell the \r\n    car until it has taken possession of it. Goods are taken possession of \r\n    according to custom, and taking possession of a car means that it is moved \r\n    physically from where it was. Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said: &ldquo;Whatever is moveable, such as garments, animals and cars etc, \r\n    possession is taken of it by moving it, because this is the custom.

This does not come under the heading of a man selling \r\n    something that he does not own, because the one who was asked for the \r\n    product only sold it to the one who asked for it after he had bought it and \r\n    taken possession of it. He does not have the right to sell it to his friend, \r\n    for example, before buying it, or after buying it but before taking \r\n    possession of it, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) forbade selling a product where it was bought, until the merchants \r\n    had added them to their own goods.

This is permissible, whether the \r\n    condition of the fruits is known or not, and there is no difference of \r\n    opinion among the fuqaha&rsquo; concerning this, because the sale of the fruit in \r\n    this case is connected to the trees, and the basic principle according to \r\n    the scholars is that rules may be relaxed when an item is sold along with \r\n    another item, but not when it is sold on its own.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The \r\n    fruits may be sold before their condition is known so long as the purchaser \r\n    cuts them down straight away, and does not wait until they ripen. This sale \r\n    is valid according to scholarly consensus, and the scholars gave the reason \r\n    that the prohibition on selling before the condition of the fruits is known \r\n    is due to the fear that the fruits may be destroyed by blight before they \r\n    are picked, but there is no risk of that if they are cut down straight \r\n    away.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The \r\n    condition of cutting them down straight away applies in some cases where the \r\n    fruits may be used before they ripen, such as if they may be used as animal \r\n    feed and other ways of benefiting from them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If there is \r\n    just one orchard, it is not essential that the condition of the fruits on \r\n    every tree be known, rather each kind of fruit should be considered on its \r\n    own, and it is sufficient for the condition of the fruits of one tree of \r\n    each type to be known.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>For example, \r\n    if the orchard contains different types of dates such as barhi and sukkari \r\n    for example, then the condition of the barhi dates is not sufficient for the \r\n    sukkari dates to be sold, rather the condition of each type must be known, \r\n    even if it is only one tree.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (4\/31):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the \r\n    condition of one tree is known, that suffices for all the other trees of \r\n    that type in the orchard.

This is a deviation from \r\n          the purpose for which the Qur&rsquo;aan was revealed, as it was revealed to \r\n          guide people, teach them in a good manner and to be read regularly, \r\n          etc. The Qur&rsquo;aan was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind \r\n          and jinn.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; Many people hang up such things to seek &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; \r\n          from them, which is a form of bid&lsquo;ah (innovation). The blessing as described \r\n          in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Qur&rsquo;aan, not from hanging \r\n          it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional \r\n          images.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; This is contrary to the practice of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs \r\n          (al-Khulafaa&rsquo; al-Raashidoon), may Allaah be pleased with them, who never \r\n          did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations. \r\n          History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the \r\n          adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of aayaat only \r\n          happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          4 &ndash; Hanging up such pictures or plaques is a means that \r\n          may lead to shirk, because some people think that these plaques and \r\n          hangings are amulets that will protect the house and its people from \r\n          evil and disease. This belief is shirk and is haraam, because the One \r\n          Who really offers protection is Allaah, may He be glorified, and one \r\n          of the means of gaining His protection is to recite the Qur&rsquo;an and du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;s \r\n          taught in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, with humility and certain faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          5 &ndash; By writing such things, it means that the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n          may be taken as a means of promoting one&rsquo;s business or increasing one&rsquo;s \r\n          earnings. The Qur&rsquo;aan should be protected from being used for such purposes. \r\n          It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and \r\n          plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          6 &ndash; Many of these plaques are painted with real gold, \r\n          which makes using them and hanging them up even more haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          7 &ndash; Many of these plaques clearly involve a kind of frivolity, \r\n          because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no \r\n          benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are \r\n          fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly \r\n          forbidden pictures of animate beings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          8 &ndash; Ayaat and soorahs of the Qur&rsquo;aan are exposed to misuse \r\n          and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are \r\n          piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects \r\n          may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken \r\n          down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned. This is in addition \r\n          to the fact that they may be hung up in places where Allaah is disobeyed \r\n          and the sanctity of the Qur&rsquo;aan is not respected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          9 &ndash; Some Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking \r\n          put these plaques up so that they can feel that they are doing something \r\n          religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt &ndash; in spite of \r\n          the fact that this practice does not help them in any way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          All in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow \r\n          the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people \r\n          the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in belief \r\n          and in all rulings of their religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Moreover, if someone were to say, &ldquo;We are not going to \r\n          abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we just want \r\n          to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings&rdquo;, our response \r\n          would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually \r\n          happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these aayaat \r\n          when they raise their heads? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          What really happens is the opposite: people go against \r\n          the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in \r\n          gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume \r\n          that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact \r\n          is that they are very few, and this does not change the hukm (Islamic \r\n          ruling) on the matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The Muslims must turn to the Book of Allaah, read it \r\n          and recite it, and act in accordance with it.

But if the amount of alcohol is little and will not cause \r\n    intoxication no matter how much is drunk, then it is permissible to use it \r\n    and sell it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;It says in \r\n    a fatwa issued by the Standing Committee concerning the sale of perfumes \r\n    that contain alcohol: &ldquo;If the amount of alcohol in the perfume reaches the \r\n    level where it will cause intoxication if a lot of that perfume is drunk, \r\n    then drinking that perfume is haraam, dealing in it is haraam, and that \r\n    applies to all kinds of uses, because it is alcohol, whether it is a lot or \r\n    a little. But if the thing with which the perfume is mixed, such as alcohol, \r\n    does not reach the level where drinking a lot of it will cause intoxication, \r\n    then it is permissible to use it and deal in it, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;Whatever causes \r\n    intoxication in large amounts, a little of it is haraam.&rsquo;&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>(<i>Fataawa \r\n    al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, 13\/54)<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;6 &ndash; \r\n    Whatever it is haraam for a Muslim to use, it is also haraam for him to sell \r\n    it to either Muslims or kaafirs, because the kaafirs are also addressed by \r\n    the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah, including rulings on minor issues, according to \r\n    the view of the majority of scholars, and what is forbidden for Muslims is \r\n    also forbidden for them. So it is not permissible to sell them alcohol or \r\n    pork, or anything else which is proven to be forbidden in our religion, even \r\n    if we assume that it is permitted to them in their religion, because the \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah of Islam abrogates and corrects the laws that came before it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;It says in\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> 13\/49:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Question: \r\n    Is it permissible to deal in alcohol and pork if one does not sell them to a \r\n    Muslim?<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Answer: It \r\n    is not permissible to deal in that which Allaah has forbidden, whether that \r\n    is food or other things, such as alcohol and pork, even if one is dealing \r\n    with kaafirs, because it was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When Allaah forbids a thing, He also \r\n    forbids its price.&rdquo; (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 2564; Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;, 5107). \r\n    And because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    cursed alcohol and the one who drinks it, the one who sells it, the one who \r\n    buys it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who consumes its price, the one who squeezes out the juice and the one for whom it is squeezed out.&rdquo; (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1295; <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>, 1041).<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"8097","question_id":"8097","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big><span>We \r\n          put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen, may Allaah \r\n          preserve him, who answered as follows: <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><span>It \r\n          is permissible to pay that as a fee. <\/span><\/big>\r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"8098","question_id":"8098","answers":"<p>\r\n      <span>\r\n      Praise\r\n      be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is not permissible to sell haraam things \r\n    such as cigarettes, promiscuous magazines or magazines that promote evil, \r\n    even if they are published by Muslims, because when Allaah forbids a thing \r\n    He also forbids its price.

It exploits their love of accumulating wealth. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

This \r\n    analogy in the hadeeth serves to make this prohibition very emphatic indeed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; After a thorough examination of this issue, it is clear that introducing the \r\n    product &ndash; which is software programs, a web site and e-mail &ndash; does not change the ruling on this operation, because it is obvious that the product \r\n    is not what most of those who rush to buy actually want, as is proven from the evidence mentioned in the detailed answer. Introducing this product \r\n    in this manner makes it even more haraam, because it involves trickery that leads to a haraam transaction which is a kind of gambling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; This operation is unlike the kind of commission that is permitted, in several \r\n    ways:&nbsp; one has to pay money in order to enter the scheme, unlike the commission that requires no such condition. The purpose is not to sell the \r\n    product to those who need it, rather the purpose is to build an incentive system. Even if we accept that this is commission, it is still haraam \r\n    because it involves cheating the purchaser and raising false hopes and being insincere towards him. Based on this, the view of those who permit it \r\n    on the grounds that it is commission is not correct.&nbsp; Perhaps the reason for that is that this matter has not been described to them as it really \r\n    is, or the one who issued this ruling did not understand it properly. This ruling is applicable to many kinds of dealings and transactions that \r\n    occur nowadays in the marketing field. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Those who wish to learn more will find detailed discussion of these points in the \r\n    detailed answer and in the discussion of basic principles given below.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><b>Detailed Answer:<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Before giving a detailed answer to this question, and in order to train ourselves \r\n    to accept the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah, we should start by noting some of the basic principles of sharee&rsquo;ah etc which will help the Muslim &ndash; who \r\n    submits to the rulings of Allaah &ndash; to deal with this operation and similar schemes devised by business-minded people, in a confident manner, \r\n    especially when the following five main factors are present in these operations:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Widespread media and advertising media<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Ease of financial transfer by means of credit cards and the like<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Increased need for money among ordinary people, because of excessive desire to accumulate \r\n    non-essentials<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Greed and love of money in human nature<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Lack of religious commitment and desire to seek halaal provision among many Muslims<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There follow a number of principles that will help us to deal with this kind of \r\n    operation and similar types which are bound to appear in the future, so we should pay attention to these details:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The fitnah (temptation) of money is one of the greatest fitnahs that can \r\n    affect man&rsquo;s religious commitment and the blessing of what he already has of wealth and children. So we must beware of that and seek to ensure \r\n    that the sources of our wealth are permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Avoiding doubtful issues is a principle that is well known in Islam, even if \r\n    one is not quite certain that the doubtful matter is in fact haraam. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;What it \r\n    halaal is clear and what is haraam is clear, and between them lie doubtful matters which many people do not know about. Whoever is avoids the \r\n    doubtful matters has protected his religious commitment and his honour, but whoever falls into doubtful matters will fall into that which is \r\n    haraam.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 52; Muslim, 1599.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; &ldquo;If any of this money comes to you without you asking for it or hoping for it, \r\n    then take it, but do not think about it or hope for it.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 138, in a marfoo&rsquo; report. This means: do not let yourself dwell \r\n    on thoughts of money that you do not have, or let that make you feel sad if you do not get it. The prohibition on thinking about it mentioned in \r\n    this hadeeth refers to being given a gift of something that is permissible &ndash; so how about if you dwell on thoughts of dubious wealth, or wealth \r\n    that is haraam? This will inevitably lead to more negative effects and should be shunned even more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; &ldquo;Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him \r\n    with something better than it.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad and&nbsp; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. This includes both the one who gives up something haraam \r\n    and the one who gives up something concerning which there is doubt. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; Blessing in wealth, even if it is little, is better than seeking to increase \r\n    wealth in haraam or dubious ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; The Muslim should strive to be completely honest with himself in recognizing \r\n    his motive in joining such schemes. Is he hoping to get money and needs the product as a means to reduce guilt and ward off blame, or is the \r\n    product itself what he basically wants? He should note that whatever he conceals of his intentions is known to Allaah who knows what is secret and \r\n    what is yet more hidden, and He will ask him about that and bring him to account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; The ruling on a matter is based on the way in which it is understood. Withholding some \r\n    information from the mufti does not allow you to follow his fatwa, and that does not excuse the one who follows it from blame, so long as he knows \r\n    that the mufti does not have the full picture.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>8 &ndash; &ldquo;Righteousness is that with which the heart feels at ease, and sin is that \r\n    which you feel uneasy about, even if the people give you fatwa after fatwa.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, 17320. Al-Albaani said in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb<\/i>, \r\n    1734, it is hasan li ghayrihi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>9 &ndash; If the one who consumes haraam wealth acknowledges that he is doing something \r\n    haraam, this is less serious than one who consumes it by means of deceit and trickery, because the latter has added another sin to his consumption \r\n    of haraam wealth, which is his trying to deceive Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Changing the definition and name of things that are haraam when their essence remains the \r\n    same is even more evil, as well as involving an attempt to deceive Allaah and His Messenger, and claiming that Islam accepts trickery, deception, \r\n    cheating and hypocrisy, and that sharee&rsquo;ah forbids something because it is evil but then allows it when it becomes even worse. Hence Ayyoob \r\n    al-Sakhtiyaani said that some people try to cheat Allaah like they cheat children. If they were to commit the sin believing that it is a sin that \r\n    would be less serious.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Ighaathat al-Lahfaan<\/i>, 1\/354.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>10 &ndash; If it is proven to a person that a thing is haraam, then he must stop \r\n    thinking about it and should feel no regret for not having it when he sees that others have it. He should praise Allaah for having saved him and \r\n    ask Him to make him hate haraam things no matter how great they are, and help him always to avoid them, and help him to strive against his nafs \r\n    (self) to stop thinking about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>11 &ndash; The rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah are based on complete knowledge and wisdom. It pays \r\n    attention to the common interest even if that involves something that he thinks may be detrimental to his own personal interests. So the Muslim \r\n    should not think only of his own personal gains and overlook the aims of sharee&rsquo;ah which seeks the common interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the detailed answer, it may be summed up in the following three points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly: The way this operation is done is very similar to so called pyramid \r\n    schemes or multi-level marketing (MLM), even though it may not be exactly the same in all aspects. Pyramid schemes are based on an incentive \r\n    system, and those who invented them in the west looked only at earning money, with no attention to the question of whether the source is \r\n    permissible or not. If we assess this system in the light of the texts and principles of sharee&rsquo;ah, it will become clear that it is haraam from a \r\n    number of angles, such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is based on consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully, because this pyramid will inevitably have a \r\n    final level, and these people will definitely lose out to the interests of the higher levels. The pyramid can only grow when there are people who \r\n    will lose out to the interests of the higher levels which will collect insanely high commissions. In the last two levels of every branch there \r\n    will be two levels, the first of which is lying and giving false hope to the next level of making a profit, and the last level which will be \r\n    fooled and cheated, because it will buy but will never find someone to sell to. We have already mentioned above the verses and hadeeth which \r\n    sternly forbid consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is based on gambling, which means that a person pays money in return for which he may get more \r\n    money than he paid, or he may lose his money. This is what happens to those who join such schemes. This is one of the most important and clearest \r\n    reasons for it being haraam.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Because pyramid schemes involve a lot of cheating and deception, they have been banned and outlawed \r\n    by many kaafir western systems &ndash; if they appear in a form where there is no product for sale &ndash; even though those systems allow riba and gambling \r\n    in principle &ndash; and their experts have warned against them. (See the following website and its many links:\r\n    http:\/\/skepdic.com\/pyramid.html)<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Based on the above, the &ldquo;Business&rdquo; operation mentioned in the \r\n    question is haraam for many reasons, because it resembles pyramid schemes in the main reason why it is haraam, which is th1at it is a form of \r\n    gambling and consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly: Including a product in such a program does not make \r\n    it permissible or remove the reasons why it is haraam, rather it makes it even more emphatically haraam, because this is a kind of trickery aimed \r\n    at making this operation acceptable and giving the impression that the product is the main objective. But &ldquo;Changing the definition and name of \r\n    things that are haraam when their essence remains the same is even more evil, as well as involving an attempt to deceive Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger.&rdquo; <i>Ighaathat al-Lahfaan<\/i>, 1\/354&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It seems that the product has no effect of rendering the \r\n    operation permissible for the following reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The most important motive for participants is the marketing, not the product, based on the fact that \r\n    these kinds of programs and services existed many years before this company appeared and still exist, for a lower price! What is making so many \r\n    people rush towards these schemes, and this particular company, apart from the hopes of the income generated by joining this scheme?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The suggestion that the products are useful and easy to operate and have distinct features that make \r\n    it worth paying one hundred dollars for them is a flawed argument, because this program has no copyright preventing individuals making use of the \r\n    site through the one who has already joined, without the new user paying anything. Indeed if one individual subscribes, dozens could use it and \r\n    benefit from all the services offered on the site. It only has copyright protecting other companies from using it. What motive is there to spend \r\n    money on it except to be part of this pyramid scheme which is in effect gambling?<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>There is an essential condition for joining this pyramid scheme, which is that one buys the product \r\n    for more than the price of similar products in order to obtain more commission and to use the company&rsquo;s website for advertising and marketing. \r\n    Temptation leads people to pay the exorbitant price in the hope of recouping it and making more by means of the marketing which is the primary \r\n    purpose for joining. This is the essence of gambling which is forbidden in sharee&rsquo;ah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The mention of tempting commission in return for marketing is what motivates people to buy and join \r\n    the scheme, because usually they do not buy unless this commission is mentioned, and because some may even agree to buy without checking on the \r\n    products they are buying, or without needing them in the first place. The fact that many people do not benefit from most of the programs confirms \r\n    this further; in fact some of them do not even use the programs at all.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(v)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The amount required to join - $99 &ndash; is equivalent to a month&rsquo;s salary or more in some countries, so \r\n    ordinary people would not pay such an amount and join this scheme, unless there is the hope of making a lot of money. Yet despite that many people \r\n    join and even take out loans for that purpose.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(vi)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When those who join for the sake of the product find out the company states that three-quarters of \r\n    what they paid is spent on marketing instead of using advertising agencies, this motivates them to take part in marketing in order to recoup what \r\n    they have paid in excess of the product&rsquo;s value. So they get involved in the marketing process, then they get carried away and do not stop at \r\n    making up what they have lost, rather they keep going.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(vii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Some enthusiasts buy the company&rsquo;s product more than once and some, as they have themselves admitted, \r\n    buy it one hundred times!

No one would doubt that this is a form of gambling, and clearly indicates that the aim of this operation is gambling.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(viii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The company obliges purchasers to continue marketing and earning high commissions by renewing their \r\n    subscriptions annually for the same amount, on the basis that they are going to add new services. But these new services &ndash; even if they are real &ndash; \r\n    still add up to buying something unknown for a set price, because the new services may be small, or they may contain new programs that the \r\n    subscriber has no need of. So this purchase is haraam because it involves deceit and ambiguity, as one of the parties has no idea what he is \r\n    buying.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(ix)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The individual should check himself and understand his intentions in joining this program.

Those muftis who stated that it is a kind of brokerage only answered \r\n    questions in which no details were mentioned that would give a proper picture of the issue, thus these fatwas do not reflect reality. One of the \r\n    conditions for a ruling to be valid is that it must be based on proper understanding of the issue. Based on this, it is not permissible to follow \r\n    one whose ruling is known to be based on an imperfect understanding of the issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The differences between this operation and permissible brokerage include the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Brokerage refers to when a middleman points out a product or some benefits that are sought in and of \r\n    themselves, where ultimately the one who acquires the product will benefit from it. The marketing offered by this company is simply opportunities \r\n    for marketing to people who will sell it to others, and it will ultimately reach a person or persons who will not get what they hoped for from the \r\n    transaction.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>In brokerage there is no condition which requires the broker to pay any money because it is not in \r\n    the interests of the owner of the product to discourage the broker by imposing the condition that he pay him or buy from him. But in the case of \r\n    this marketing, the one who wants to be a part of it is obliged to pay a sum of money, included in the price of the program, in order to join it \r\n    or benefit from it, so that he can become a marketing agent. Then he has to renew the payment annually in order to continue marketing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The broker is keen to look for more people who need the product, whereas the marketing agent looks \r\n    for those who are most able to market the program, regardless of whether they need it or not.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The broker has nothing to do with what the purchasers do with the product, whereas the marketing \r\n    agent in these schemes needs to market the product continually, so that he can complete the numbers required in order to earn his commission.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(v)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>In the case of brokerage, the broker earns according to how much he sells, but in this scheme two \r\n    people may have a share in the number of people to whom the product is marketed, directly or indirectly, but there may be a huge difference in the \r\n    commission they earn because of the conditions that they stipulate as to how commission is earned. This confirms the fact that the main aim is \r\n    multi-level marketing, not promotion of the product.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>These five differences between the two operations demonstrate the essential \r\n    differences between them, which means that the &ldquo;Business&rdquo; scheme cannot be regarded as permissible when compared with brokerage, especially since \r\n    there are many factors in the &ldquo;Business&rdquo; program which render it haraam, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(vi)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If we assume that it is a kind of brokerage &ndash; which is not correct &ndash; then it is still haraam because \r\n    this marketing agent cannot state to the one to whom he presents this product that there is a similar product offered by other companies for \r\n    one-quarter or one-half of their price, or that he may not need some of what is on offer, let alone the fact that he could benefit from the \r\n    program by going to the company&rsquo;s site and using the marketing agent&rsquo;s password, without affecting him or paying him anything. He has to focus on \r\n    the large commission that he will earn if he buys and markets the product.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(vii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Those who regard it as a kind of brokerage and say that it is permissible stipulate that the \r\n    marketing thereof should not involve any kind of deceit and should not praise the product for qualities that it does not possess.

The hadeeth clearly states that the \r\n    hand-to-hand transaction is essential when selling gold for gold and silver \r\n    for silver. Based on that, it is not permissible to sell one currency for \r\n    another unless the exchange is made on the spot in the same meeting as the \r\n    deal is done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One currency should not be sold for another unless it is done \r\n    hand to hand, like for like.

Islamically acceptable means are available and are \r\n    sufficient &ndash; praise be to Allaah &ndash; and the people have no need of riba, but \r\n    the shaytaan calls them to that and makes quick earnings by means of riba \r\n    attractive to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> \r\n    (7\/294, 295).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah al-Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with dealing in currencies, which \r\n    means selling one currency for another, but that is subject to the condition \r\n    that the exchange be made before parting, whether one pays actual currency \r\n    and receives something that takes the place of currency, such as certified \r\n    cheques, in return, and whether the two parties are acting on their own \r\n    behalf or on behalf of someone else.

The way in which the exchange takes place may vary according to \r\n    the situation and customs with regard to receiving the value. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among the non-physical forms of receiving the value that are \r\n    permissible are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Transferring money into the \r\n    agent&rsquo;s account in the following ways:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When it is deposited into the \r\n    agent&rsquo;s account, directly or via wire transfer<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When the agent makes \r\n    arrangements between himself and the bank to receive the money in the case \r\n    of buying one currency for another, so that the money will automatically be \r\n    transferred to the agent&rsquo;s account<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When the bank &ndash; on the \r\n    instructions of the agent &ndash; deducts money from one account to another \r\n    account of his in a different currency, whether it is in the same bank or a \r\n    different one, in the interests of the beneficiary or another agent.

One of the main \r\n    causes of the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange on &ldquo;Black Monday&rdquo; was \r\n    dealings with the margin system, because of commands to sell that were \r\n    programmed into brokers&rsquo; computers, telling them to sell in the event that \r\n    prices dropped to a certain level. When the prices actually fell, the \r\n    commands to sell were triggered automatically, which led to an unprecedented \r\n    flooding of the market when there was no demand, and this is what led to the \r\n    collapse.

Some of them said that it is permissible because \r\n    if a man buys an item because he wants the item itself or he wants its price \r\n    (by selling it), and both are valid aims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars said that it is not permissible, because \r\n    the aim is to take dirhams for dirhams, and the item comes in between as a \r\n    means of making the transaction permissible, and making a haraam thing \r\n    permissible by other means does not change anything. And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Actions are but by \r\n    intentions, and each man will have but that which he intended.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The view that this kind of <i>tawarruq<\/i> is haraam is that \r\n    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and it was narrated in one report \r\n    from Imam Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to the report of Abu Dawood, Imam Ahmad regarded it \r\n    as a type of &lsquo;aynah, as was narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in <i>Tahdheeb \r\n    al-Sunan<\/i>, 5\/801.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But in light of the people&rsquo;s needs nowadays and the lack of \r\n    lenders, we should say that it is permissible, subject to certain \r\n    conditions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the person be in need of \r\n    money; if he is not in need of money then it is not permissible, like those \r\n    who resort to this method in order to lend to others.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That he should not be able to \r\n    obtain money in any other permissible manner, such as a loan. If he is able \r\n    to obtain money in some other manner, then this method is not permissible \r\n    because he has no need for it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That the contract should not \r\n    include anything that resembles forms of riba, such as saying, &ldquo;I sell this \r\n    to you, the price of which is ten, for eleven&rdquo; and so on. If it includes \r\n    such things then it is either makrooh or haraam. It was narrated that Imam \r\n    Ahmad said concerning such deals: such as if it is dirhams for dirhams, it \r\n    is not valid. This is the view of Imam Ahmad. Based on this, the correct \r\n    method is for the lender to know the value of the item and how much profit \r\n    he will make, then say to the borrower: I will sell it to you for such and \r\n    such, until one year.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The borrower should not sell it \r\n    until he has taken possession of it and moved it to his own space, because \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade selling \r\n    an item before the traders move it to their own space. <\/span>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If these four conditions are met, then the view that <i>\r\n    tawarruq<\/i> is permissible may be adopted, so as to relieve the people of \r\n    hardship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted that it is not permissible for the \r\n    borrower to sell it to the lender for less than he bought it for under any \r\n    circumstances whatsoever, because this comes under the heading of &lsquo;aynah. \r\n    End quote.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8129","question_id":"8129","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to this kind of transaction we need to address \r\n    both the seller and the buyer. We say to the seller: Are you raising the \r\n    price of the product because of this prize, or not? If you are raising the \r\n    price then that is not permissible, because if the price is raised and the \r\n    people buy from him, they will be either losers or winners, i.e., they will \r\n    either lose out or gain something.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this product is worth ten in the marketplace, for example, \r\n    but you sell it for twelve because of the prize, this is not permissible, \r\n    because the one who buys it for twelve will either lose the extra amount \r\n    that he paid, or he will gain many times that amount in the prize, so this \r\n    comes under the heading of gambling, which is haraam. This is one point. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the seller says, &lsquo;I am selling it for the regular price, \r\n    no more and no less,&rsquo; then he may offer those prizes to encourage people to \r\n    buy from him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then we turn to the buyer and say to him: Did you buy this \r\n    product because you need it, and you would have bought it whether there was \r\n    a prize or not? Or did you buy it only because of the prize? If he says the \r\n    former, we say: there is nothing wrong with buying from this one or that \r\n    one, because so long as the price is like the regular price, and you are \r\n    buying this product because you need it, then you will either be a winner or \r\n    you will be safe from loss. In that case there is nothing wrong with buying \r\n    from the one who offers prizes. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he says: I am buying it although I do not want the \r\n    product, I am only buying it so that I can get the prize, we say: This is a \r\n    waste of money, because you do not know whether you will win the prize or \r\n    not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I have heard that some people will buy a carton of milk when \r\n    they do not want it; they buy it and throw it away, because there is the \r\n    chance of winning a prize. This is a waste of money, and it was proven that \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting \r\n    money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There remains a third point: if someone were to say: This \r\n    transaction harms other sellers, because if this seller offers prizes and \r\n    his price is like everyone else&rsquo;s, then all the people will go to him and \r\n    the products of other sellers will remain unsold, so it will be harming \r\n    others.

At that time the \r\n    scribe was in the service of the scholar or author, and would make one copy \r\n    or several copies with his pen, and were it not for that, the book would be \r\n    limited to the author&rsquo;s original copy and would be vulnerable to being lost \r\n    forever if the original copy was destroyed.&nbsp; So copying the book was not a \r\n    transgression against the author, and the copier was not making use of the \r\n    efforts and knowledge of another person for his own benefit; rather the \r\n    opposite was true &ndash; he was serving him and spreading his knowledge and \r\n    efforts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; But after the invention of printing presses, it became \r\n    the exact opposite: the author may spend most of his life writing a \r\n    beneficial book, and publishing and selling it, then another person could \r\n    take a copy of it and publish it by modern means of printing and \r\n    photocopying, and he could sell it in competition with the author, or \r\n    distribute it for free in order to become famous by means of distribution, \r\n    and thus the author&rsquo;s efforts would be wasted. The same may also be said of \r\n    inventors.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is something that could discourage people of knowledge \r\n    and smart people from writing and inventing, when they see that their \r\n    efforts are going to be stolen as soon as they appear, and people who put no \r\n    effort into them as the original authors and inventors did will make a \r\n    business out of selling them and competing with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The situation changed with the development of new means and \r\n    methods, which had a serious impact on the change from what things used to \r\n    be to how they have become, which requires us to examine anew how people&rsquo;s \r\n    efforts and rights may be protected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The author and inventor should have rights with regard to \r\n    that which they have written and invented, and this right is something that \r\n    belongs to them according to sharee&rsquo;ah. It is not permissible for anyone to \r\n    take it away from them without their permission, provided that the book or \r\n    research does not promote evil in any way, or contain bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) or \r\n    misguidance that is contrary to the laws of Islam, otherwise it should be \r\n    destroyed and it is not permissible to publish it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly neither the publisher with whom the author makes a \r\n    deal nor anyone else has the right to change any of the book&rsquo;s content or to \r\n    change anything else without the author&rsquo;s consent. This right may be \r\n    inherited from the author, but should be restricted to the norms of \r\n    international rules, covenants, systems and traditions which do not go \r\n    against sharee&rsquo;ah and which regulate and define this right after the author \r\n    dies and in the light of his individual rights and the public&rsquo;s rights, \r\n    because every author and inventor seeks the help of ideas and products of \r\n    those who came before him, even it is only in terms of general information \r\n    and means that existed before him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the author or inventor who is commissioned or \r\n    hired by a publisher to write a book or by a company to invent something for \r\n    it for a specific purpose, what he produces becomes the right of the company \r\n    that hired him, and he is bound by the conditions that they agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

I have been doing \r\n    that without purchasing an original copy of these programs, knowing that \r\n    these programs carry warnings against making copies and their copyright is \r\n    protected, like the phrase &ldquo;all rights reserved&rdquo; which appears on some \r\n    books. The author of the program may be a Muslim or a kaafir. My question \r\n    is: is it permissible to make copies in this manner or not?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied: It is not permissible to make copies of \r\n    programs whose authors have forbidden the making of copies without their \r\n    permission, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The Muslims are bound by their conditions.&rdquo; And he (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever reaches a permissible thing \r\n    first has more right to it.&rdquo; It does not matter whether the author of the \r\n    program is a Muslim or a kaafir who is not in a state of war with Islam, \r\n    because the rights of a kaafir who is not in a state of war with Islam are \r\n    to be respected like the rights of a Muslim.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, \r\n    13\/188.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, it is not permissible for anyone to copy \r\n    anything of which the author&rsquo;s copyright is protected, and it is not \r\n    permissible to buy any of these programs that have been copied without the \r\n    permission of their authors. With the ease of communication nowadays, it is \r\n    not difficult to obtain and purchase these things. The original program is \r\n    available and one should be able to get it from the official agents of these \r\n    companies. They are also available on the websites of the same companies on \r\n    the internet and one can easily buy them and obtain them from those places.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of our scholars think that it is haraam to do this (copy \r\n    things) for the purpose of selling them, but if a person makes a copy just \r\n    for himself, that is permissible. This opinion is a moderate one that treads \r\n    a middle path between those who ban it altogether and those who permit it \r\n    altogether.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]21927[\\fatin] we gave a brief answer to \r\n    this question, quoting from Shaykh Sa&rsquo;d al-Humayyid, in which it says the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Making copies of books or disks for the purpose of selling \r\n    them or to cause harm to the original author is not permissible. But if a \r\n    person makes a single copy for his own use, then we hope that is o.k., even \r\n    though it is better and preferable not to do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There follows a fatwa from Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) which is in accordance with that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Question: Is it permissible to copy a computer program even \r\n    though the companies and the system do not allow that? Or is that regarded \r\n    as a monopoly? They are sold at high prices but if they are copied they may \r\n    be sold for cheaper prices.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: Do you mean Qur&rsquo;aan (programs)?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: Computer programs in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: For Qur&rsquo;aan?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: For Qur&rsquo;aan and other things, hadeeth and many \r\n    other programs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: Do you mean what is recorded in it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: What is recorded on the disks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: If the authorities forbid that, then it is not \r\n    permissible, because Allaah has enjoined us to obey those who are in \r\n    authority, except it if involves disobedience to Allaah, but banning the \r\n    copying of these things is not disobedience to Allaah. With regard to \r\n    companies, what I think is that if a person makes a single copy for himself \r\n    only, there is nothing wrong with it, but if he makes copies to sell, that \r\n    is not permissible, because it is harming others, and it is like \r\n    undercutting one's Muslim brother, because if they sell it for one hundred \r\n    and you copy it and sell it for fifty, this is undercutting your brother.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: Is it permissible for me to buy it for fifty from \r\n    the shop-owners, if it is a copy?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: It is not permissible, unless he proves that he has \r\n    permission, but if he does not have such proof then this is encouraging sin \r\n    and transgression.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: If he does not have permission &ndash; may Allaah \r\n    reward you with good?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: If you do not know, sometimes a person may not know, \r\n    he may pass by a store and buy something and he does not know, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with that; the one who does not know is not to blame.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Liqaa&rsquo;aat al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i> \r\n    (178\/question no. 6)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information please see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]52903[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8163","question_id":"8163","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no differentiation between Muslims and non-Muslims \r\n    when it comes to that which it is haraam to sell and deal in.

In every case \r\n    where the seller knows that the buyer is going to use (the item) for sinful \r\n    purposes, it is haraam for him to sell it to him. Applying perfume to idols \r\n    and killing animals for food without slaughtering them properly are two \r\n    major sins even for them, because the correct view is that the rules of \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah are addressed to the kuffaar just as they are addressed to the \r\n    Muslims.

I \r\n    [the narrator] said to Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas: Why is that? He said: Because they are \r\n    exchanging dirhams for dirhams, but the delivery of food is delayed?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2132; Muslim, 1252<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Ibn Hajar said in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 4\/349: What is meant \r\n    is that he was asking about the reason for this prohibition, and Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    replied that if the purchaser sells it before taking possession of it when \r\n    the item is still in the possession of the seller, it is as if he sold \r\n    dirhams for dirhams. This is explained by what is mentioned in the report of \r\n    Sufyaan from Ibn Tawoos that is narrated by Muslim. Tawoos said: I said to \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas: Why is that? He said: Don&rsquo;t you see that they are exchanging \r\n    gold, but the delivery of food is delayed? i.e., if he buys foodstuff for \r\n    one hundred dinars, for example, and he gives the money to the seller but \r\n    does not take the foodstuff from him, then he sells the foodstuff to someone \r\n    else for one hundred and twenty dinars and takes it from him when the food \r\n    is still in the possession of the (first) seller, then it is as if he sold \r\n    one hundred dinars for one hundred and twenty dinars, it looks as if he sold \r\n    one hundred dinars for one hundred and twenty. According to this \r\n    interpretation the prohibition is not restricted only to foodstuffs. Hence \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: I think that all things are like this. And this is \r\n    supported by the hadeeth of Zayd ibn Thaabit, according to which the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade \r\n    selling a product in the place where it was bought until the merchants have \r\n    taken it to their own places.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood; classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-&lsquo;Ayni said in <i>&lsquo;Umdat al-Qaari<\/i> (11\/250): What this \r\n    means is: If he buys some food from a man for one dirham to be delivered \r\n    later, then he sells it back to him or to someone else before taking \r\n    possession of it for two dirhams, for example, that is not permissible \r\n    because it is in effect selling cash for cash, when the food is not there. \r\n    So it is as if he sold his dirham with which he brought the food for two \r\n    dirhams, which is riba, because it is selling something that is not there \r\n    (not in the possession of the seller) for cash. So this (transaction) is not \r\n    valid. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: It is not permissible for a Muslim to \r\n    sell an item for cash or credit unless he owns it and has taken possession \r\n    of it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said \r\n    to Hakeem ibn Hizaam: &ldquo;Do not sell that which you do not possess.&rdquo; And he \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth of \r\n    &lsquo;Abdullah ibn &lsquo;Amr ibn al-&lsquo;Aas (may Allah be pleased with him): &ldquo;It is not \r\n    permissible to take a loan and sell at the same time or to sell that which \r\n    is not in your possession.&rdquo; Narrated by the five with a saheeh isnaad. \r\n    Similarly, the one who buys it does not have the right to sell it until he \r\n    also takes possession of it, because of the two hadeeths quoted above and \r\n    because of the report narrated by Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawood, and classed as \r\n    saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim, from Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) forbade selling a product in the place where it was \r\n    bought until the merchants have taken it to their own places.

The first is that if a specific amount of money is \r\n    stipulated, it is possible that they may not make any other profit, so that \r\n    person will take all of the profit. And it is possible that they may not \r\n    make a profit at all, so it would be taken from the capital. Or they may \r\n    make a great deal of profit, and the one for whom a specific amount of money \r\n    was stipulated will lose out. The second reason is that the share of the \r\n    agent should be a known percentage, because it is not permissible for it to \r\n    be a set amount of money. If the percentages are unknown, it is invalid.

That is because transactions should be \r\n    based on fairness, and these transactions are a kind of partnership, and it \r\n    can only be a partnership if each partner gets a percentage, such as \r\n    one-third or one-half.

Based on \r\n    that, this is not allowed according to sharee&rsquo;ah because it involves \r\n    ambiguity and consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully, since the one who joins \r\n    the scheme does not know whether he will succeed in convincing others to \r\n    join or not. If he succeeds then he will profit at their expense from their \r\n    subscriptions, otherwise he will lose the money that he paid to join the \r\n    scheme, and those who joined through him will be subject to the same risks. \r\n    Each level in the pyramid will lose, unless there is a level beneath them \r\n    which can bear the brunt of the loss, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatout]43595[\\fatout]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows \r\n    best<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8174","question_id":"8174","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This company&rsquo;s activities \r\n    are similar to those of the &ldquo;Business&rdquo; company, and the scholars have stated \r\n    that it is haraam to subscribe to this company.

Then each of these people who joined the program has to convince \r\n    others to buy as well, and the first one gets increased commission [?] and \r\n    so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason why it is haraam to join this type of program may \r\n    be explained by the following points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; It is based on consuming wealth unlawfully&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It is based on ambiguity (and deceit) that is forbidden \r\n    in sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>Consuming wealth unlawfully:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is clear from the above that this kind of program cannot \r\n    grow without there being someone who will lose out to the interests of those \r\n    who profit from it, whether it stops growing or not.&nbsp; Loss is inevitable for \r\n    the final levels of the pyramid in all cases, and without it the higher \r\n    levels cannot gain their astronomical commission. The losers will be in the \r\n    majority and only a few will profit, i.e., the few will take the wealth of \r\n    the majority unlawfully. This is consuming wealth unlawfully which the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan forbids. The economists call this a zero-sum game, whereby what some \r\n    gain is what the others lose.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>Ambiguity:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic meaning of the kind of ambiguity that is haraam is \r\n    paying money in exchange for something which one thinks is most likely not \r\n    to exist, or may exist in a manner that is not desired. Hence the fuqaha&rsquo; \r\n    said: ambiguity is uncertainty between two things, the most likely of which \r\n    is the one that the person fears or dislikes most. The one who joins these \r\n    schemes pays money in return for profits that are unlikely to be realized.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Conclusion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Schemes that are based on pyramid selling, including the \r\n    scheme mentioned in the question, are based on consuming wealth unlawfully \r\n    and deceiving others, because this pyramid cannot continue forever, and when \r\n    it stops the result will be that a few will gain at the expense of the \r\n    majority. The logic of pyramid marketing depends on huge profits for the top \r\n    levels at the expense of the lower levels of the pyramid, and the last \r\n    levels will always lose out, even if we assume that the pyramid will never \r\n    end. The fact that there is a product does not make this scheme permissible, \r\n    rather this makes it come under the heading of deceit which is haraam. And \r\n    Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Shaykh also said concerning the &ldquo;Tasweeq net&rdquo; company in \r\n    particular:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The system mentioned in the question is a pyramid marketing \r\n    system, which may appear in a variety of forms, but may be summed up as \r\n    being a system where the subscriber persuades others to buy in order to join \r\n    the marketing scheme. As long as the commission is greater than the price of \r\n    the product, the aim behind buying is primarily to earn commission; the \r\n    product is a secondary concern. Based on that, it is not allowed according \r\n    to sharee&rsquo;ah because it involves ambiguity and consuming wealth unlawfully, \r\n    because the subscriber does not know whether he will succeed in convincing \r\n    others to join or not. If he does succeed, he will be making profit at their \r\n    expense and the expense of the money they pay to subscribe, and if he does \r\n    not then he will lose out to the tune of whatever portion of his original \r\n    payment went towards marketing, and those who joined through him will suffer \r\n    the same fate, so every level of the pyramid will lose out, unless there is \r\n    a level or two beneath him who will bear the brunt of the loss, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also questions no. <a>\r\n    40263<\/a> and [fatin]41620[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows \r\n    best<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8175","question_id":"8175","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><span>What your husband&rsquo;s\r\n      sister said has no basis in sharee&rsquo;ah.

If what you \r\n    took is more than that, then you have to strive to return the additional \r\n    amount in an acceptable manner, or by bringing more customers for it, until \r\n    the two amounts are equal and you know that you have restored people&rsquo;s \r\n    rights or the equivalent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo; (may Allah have mercy on them) have outlined \r\n    numerous ways that make it easier for the one who wants to get rid of haraam \r\n    wealth to do so. For example, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said: This is based on an important Islamic principle having to do with the \r\n    one who has taken something to which he is not entitled according to \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah, then decides to get rid of it: if the item in question was taken \r\n    without the consent of its owner and he did not give him something to \r\n    compensate him, then he must return it to him. If he is not able to return \r\n    it to him, then he should pay off a debt that the person owes on his behalf. \r\n    If that is not possible, then he must return it to his heirs. If that is not \r\n    possible, then he must give it in charity on his behalf. If the rightful \r\n    owner chooses to take the reward for that charity on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection, then he may do so, but if he insists on taking from the good \r\n    deeds of the one who took it unlawfully, he will be able to do so in return \r\n    for the wealth (that was taken), and the reward for the charity will go to \r\n    the one who gave it, as was proven from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the money was paid with the consent of the giver in return \r\n    for something haraam, such as one who paid for alcohol or pork, or for \r\n    adultery or immoral deeds, in that case the money is not to be returned to \r\n    the one who paid it, because he paid it willingly and took something haraam \r\n    in return for it. So it is not permissible for him to have both the money \r\n    and the thing he paid for, because that is helping in sin and transgression, \r\n    and making it easy for sinners to commit sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What else could the adulterer or the one who commits immoral \r\n    actions want, if he knows that he will get what he wants and have his money \r\n    back?! Sharee&lsquo;ah is far above prescribing such a thing, and it makes no \r\n    sense. But the one who receives the money should not consume it; rather it \r\n    is evil and impure, as ruled by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him). But it is evil and impure because of the way in which \r\n    it was acquired, not because of wrongdoing to the one from whom it was \r\n    taken. The way to get rid of it and complete one&rsquo;s repentance is to give it \r\n    in charity. If he is in need of it, he may take as much as he needs and give \r\n    the rest in charity. This is the ruling on all impure earnings that are \r\n    impure because of the way in which they are acquired, whether that was in \r\n    return for something that is haraam, whether it was an item or a service. \r\n    The fact that it is deemed to be impure does not mean that it must be \r\n    returned to the one who gave it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) ruled that the earnings of a cupper are impure, but it is \r\n    not obligatory to return them to the one who paid them.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad<\/i>, 5\/690-691&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On our website, in a number of questions, we have previously \r\n    discussed these matters.

The following morning I \r\n    asked him, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, what is this strict issue that has been \r\n    revealed?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if a man were \r\n    killed in battle for the sake of Allaah, then brought back to life, then \r\n    killed and brought back to life again, then killed, and he owed a debt, he \r\n    would not enter Paradise until his debt was paid off.&rdquo; Classed as hasan by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>, 4367.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Because of this &ndash; and other \r\n    &ndash; evidence, one should not get deeply involved in debt, taking loans for \r\n    necessary and unnecessary things, or borrowing large amounts of money in \r\n    order to get into business when he does not know, perhaps Allaah will not \r\n    grant him success in this business, and then what will he do?

Rather \r\n    he should look at those who are beneath him and have less wealth than him. \r\n    If his salary is not enough, then he should look for other work through \r\n    which Allaah may grant him sufficient provision. As for taking risks and \r\n    taking loans that he is unable to pay off, this is not right. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on buying shares in \r\n    companies? And what is the ruling on taking loans in order to buy shares?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Buying shares in companies \r\n    is subject to further discussion, because we have heard that they put their \r\n    money in a foreign bank, or a virtually foreign bank, and they take interest \r\n    on it, and this is riba. If that is true then buying shares in them is \r\n    haraam, and is a major sin, because riba is a major sin. But if it is free \r\n    of that, then buying shares is halaal so long as there are no other shar&rsquo;i \r\n    reservations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for taking a loan in \r\n    order to buy these shares, whether the loan is taken in a shar&rsquo;i way, such \r\n    as an interest-free loan, or in a way that involves blatant riba, or a way \r\n    that involves hidden riba by means of a trick intended to deceive Allaah and \r\n    the Muslims, that is foolishness, because he does not know whether he will \r\n    be able to pay it off in the future or not, so how can he get involved in \r\n    this loan, when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And let \r\n    those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, \r\n    until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty&rdquo; [al-Noor 24:33]<\/i>? Allaah did \r\n    not tell these people who cannot afford it to take out loans, even though \r\n    the need for marriage is greater than the need for wealth. Similarly, the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell the \r\n    one who could not afford it to do that, and he did not tell the one who \r\n    could not find an iron ring for a mahr to do that. As this is the case, it \r\n    indicates that the Lawgiver does not approve of taking loans, so the wise \r\n    man who is keen to protect his religious commitment and reputation will \r\n    beware of indulging in loans.

This transaction is called tawarruq which is derived from <i>\r\n    al-wariq<\/i>, meaning silver, because the purchaser does not want the \r\n    product per se, rather he wants cash.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This transaction is \r\n    permissible according to the majority of scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; What is known as \r\n    organized tawarruq through the bank.

The customer then delegates the \r\n    bank to sell the item for a lower price, but the customer does not take \r\n    possession of the product either, or even see it; he is not interested in it \r\n    in most cases, rather what he wants is cash. This form of tawarruq is \r\n    haraam, but it is widespread nowadays, and some banks offer this on the \r\n    basis that it is a legitimate form of tawarruq. A number of scholars have \r\n    issued fatwas stating that it is haraam, and the Islamic Fiqh Council has \r\n    also issued a resolution stating that it is haraam.

This is interest that is charged to the \r\n    purchaser if he does not make a decision on the same day, and which may be a \r\n    percentage of the loan or a set amount.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Commission, which is the money that the agent gets as a \r\n    result of the investor&rsquo;s (customer&rsquo;s) dealing through him, and it is an \r\n    agreed-upon percentage of the value of the sale or purchase.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; The pledge, which is a commitment signed by the customer \r\n    agreeing to leave the contract with the agent as a pledge for a loan, giving \r\n    him the right to sell these contracts and take back the loan if the \r\n    customer&rsquo;s losses reach a specific percentage of the margin, unless the \r\n    customer increases the pledge in order to compensate for a drop in the price \r\n    of the product.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Committee believes that this transaction is not \r\n    permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah for the following reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: It involves obvious riba, which is represented by \r\n    the addition to the amount of the loan which is called &ldquo;paying fees for \r\n    delaying the deal&rdquo;. This is a kind of haraam riba. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains \r\n    (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>279.&nbsp;And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war \r\n    from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital \r\n    sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you \r\n    shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:278-279]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: The agent stipulates that the customer must deal \r\n    through him, which leads to combining both giving a loan for something in \r\n    return and paying commission, which is akin to combining giving a loan and \r\n    selling at the same time, which is forbidden in sharee&rsquo;ah because the \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It is not \r\n    permissible to give a loan and sell at the same time&hellip;&rdquo; The hadeeth was \r\n    narrated by Abu Dawood (3\/384) and al-Tirmidhi (3\/526), who said it is a \r\n    hasan saheeh hadeeth. In this case he has benefited from his loan, and the \r\n    fuqaha&rsquo; are unanimously agreed that every loan that brings a benefit is \r\n    haraam riba.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: Dealings that are done in this manner in the global \r\n    markets usually involve many contracts that are haraam according to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Dealing in bonds, which comes \r\n    under the heading of riba which is haraam. This was stated in a resolution \r\n    of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah, no. 60, in its sixth session.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Dealing indiscriminately in \r\n    company shares. The fourth statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the \r\n    Muslim World League in its fourteenth session in 1415 AH stated that it is \r\n    haraam to deal in the shares of companies whose main purposes are haraam, or \r\n    some of their dealings involve riba.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Selling currencies is usually \r\n    done without the hand to hand exchange which makes them permissible \r\n    according to sharee&rsquo;ah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Dealing in options and futures. \r\n    A resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah no. (63), in its sixth \r\n    session, stated that options are not permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah, \r\n    because the object of dealing in these contracts is not money or services or \r\n    a financial obligation which it is permissible to exchange. The same applies \r\n    to futures and trading in indexes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>In some cases the agent is \r\n    selling something that he does not possess, and selling what one does not \r\n    possess is forbidden in sharee&rsquo;ah. <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly: This transaction involves economic harm to the \r\n    parties involved, especially the customer (investor), and to the economy of \r\n    the society in general, because it is based on borrowing to excess and \r\n    taking risks. Such matters usually involve cheating, misleading people, \r\n    rumours, hoarding, artificial inflation of prices and rapid and strong \r\n    fluctuation of prices, with the aim of getting rich quickly and acquiring \r\n    the savings of others in unlawful ways. Hence it comes under the heading of \r\n    consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully, in addition to diverting wealth in \r\n    society from real, fruitful economic activity to this type of risk that has \r\n    no economic advantage, and it may lead to severe economic turmoil that will \r\n    cause great loss and harm in society.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Council advises financial institutions to follow the ways \r\n    of finance that are prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah and that do not involve riba and \r\n    the like, and do not have harmful economic effects on their customers or on \r\n    the economy in general, like shar&rsquo;i partnerships and the like.

So we may find a person who gave a small loan winning thousands \r\n    of pounds, whilst the one who lent thousands does not get anything. The \r\n    former takes his share of the riba and the shares of many others, whilst the \r\n    share of the latter goes to someone else.

The permissible kind \r\n    is that which involves buying an item from a trader by instalments, and \r\n    selling it for cash to someone else. We have discussed the permissibility of \r\n    this kind of tawarruq and its conditions in the answers to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]45042[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]36410[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the haraam kinds of tawarruq, there are two kinds:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Where you buy an item by instalments and sell it to the \r\n    one from whom you bought it. This is what is called bay&rsquo; al-&lsquo;eenah, and it \r\n    is called al-&lsquo;eenah because the exact product (&lsquo;ayn al-sal&rsquo;ah) that he sold \r\n    goes back to him.

In it, it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After listening to the research presented on this topic and \r\n    the discussions concerning it, it is clear to the council that the tawarruq \r\n    done by some banks at present means:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That the bank, in a regular procedure, buys an item (that is \r\n    not gold or silver) from the global market or otherwise for the mustawriq \r\n    (the person who is engaging in this transaction of tawarruq to obtain cash) \r\n    and sells it to him for a price to be paid later on, on the basis that the \r\n    bank will commit &ndash; either as a condition of a contract or according to \r\n    custom &ndash; to sell it on his behalf to another purchaser for a price to be \r\n    paid immediately, and it will hand over that price to the mustawriq.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After examining and studying the matter, the council has \r\n    determined the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: Tawarruq in the form discussed above is not \r\n    permissible for the following reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The seller&rsquo;s (i.e., the bank&rsquo;s) \r\n    commitment in the tawarruq contract to act as the deputy in selling the item \r\n    to another purchaser or arranging for someone to buy it makes it akin to the \r\n    &lsquo;eenah transaction that is forbidden in sharee&rsquo;ah, whether this commitment \r\n    is stipulated clearly or is assumed on the basis of what is customary.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>This transaction frequently \r\n    leads to a failure to fulfil the condition of taking possession of goods, \r\n    which is essential according to sharee&rsquo;ah in order for the transaction to be \r\n    valid.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>This transaction is in fact \r\n    based on providing finance with interest from the bank to the customer, and \r\n    the process of buying and selling is illusionary in most cases. \r\n    <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This transaction is not the genuine tawarruq that is known to \r\n    the fuqaha&rsquo;. In its fifteenth session the Fiqh Council stated that it is \r\n    permissible with regard to genuine transactions and subject to specific \r\n    conditions which they described. That is because there are many differences \r\n    that were discussed in previous statements.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Genuine tawarruq is based on the real purchase of an item for \r\n    a price to be paid at a later date, which enters into the possession of the \r\n    purchaser, and he acquires it in a real sense, and he becomes responsible \r\n    for it, then he sells it for cash because he needs the money, and he may or \r\n    may not be able to get it. The difference between the price of purchase that \r\n    is deferred and the sale price does not come into the bank&rsquo;s possession, and \r\n    the bank is only introduced into this tawarruq transaction in order to \r\n    justify getting more for the loan that it gave to that individual by means \r\n    of transactions that are illusionary in most cases. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: The Fiqh Council advises all banks to avoid haraam \r\n    transactions, in obedience to the command of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whilst the Council appreciates the efforts of the Islamic \r\n    banks to save the Muslim ummah from the calamity of riba, it also urges them \r\n    to make use of the genuine transactions that are based on the rulings of \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, without resorting to illusionary transactions that are \r\n    essentially pure financing in return for extras that benefit the financing \r\n    party. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Ibraaheem al-&lsquo;Uthmaan (may Allaah \r\n    bless him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reasons why we say that organized tawarruq as done by the \r\n    banks is not permissible are as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Riba &ndash; as stated above &ndash; in the \r\n    report of Sa&rsquo;eed ibn al-Musayyab (may Allaah have mercy on him).<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>(Which is similar to what we \r\n    have mentioned above) the mustawriq is not interested in the product per se, \r\n    rather he is interested in the money, and the sale in question is an \r\n    illusionary sale. The whole issue boils down to obtaining cash immediately, \r\n    to be paid for later on with a greater amount.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What indicates that this sale is something illusionary is the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The bank does not take possession of the product purchased \r\n    from the global market in any real sense, and it does not receive any \r\n    original receipts from the warehouses where this product is kept; the \r\n    product is traded on the stock market and moves from one purchaser to \r\n    another until it ends up with the final consumer, who is able to take \r\n    possession of what he has bought.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of the mustawriq it is even worse: he does not \r\n    take possession of the product in a real sense or even on paper. Hence he is \r\n    selling something that he has never acquired and that is not even specified, \r\n    because what the bank sells to its customer is something that is owned by \r\n    the bank, which is defined by a number used to identify the product, and \r\n    this number does not refer to small quantities of the product, but it is a \r\n    number that is used for the big unit that the bank divides among those who \r\n    seek tawarruq.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Appointing the bank to act on \r\n    behalf of the customer in the case of bank-type tawarruq is contrary to what \r\n    is expected of the agent, because what the bank is doing in its role as \r\n    agent is contrary to the interests of the mustawriq, which is selling the \r\n    product for a lower price than that for which the mustawriq bought it. (If \r\n    there is any aim to be achieved from a contract in the true sense of the \r\n    word, and there is a condition stipulated that contradicts this aim, then \r\n    this contract is self-contradictory in that it both affirms and denies the \r\n    aim of the contract, so nothing can be achieved and this kind of condition \r\n    is invalid.) Appointing the bank as one&rsquo;s agent in this tawarruq is one such \r\n    condition, even though it is not stipulated. If there was no such \r\n    appointment, the mustawriq would not have bought from the bank in the first \r\n    place.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Giving guarantees to the last \r\n    purchaser. The bank makes a deal with an independent party that commits to \r\n    buying the product that is being used in this transaction. This commitment \r\n    ensures that the selling price will not go beyond a certain limit as a \r\n    protection against fluctuation in prices. In return for this assurance, the \r\n    bank is committed to selling it for him, in the sense that the bank is not \r\n    entitled to sell the product in the open market even if the price rises \r\n    above the price agreed upon with the second purchaser. Thus these assurances \r\n    come from both parties: from the bank which commits to sell to the second \r\n    purchaser, and from the purchaser who agrees to buy it at a certain price.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Organized tawarruq differs from \r\n    the kind of tawarruq which is permitted by the majority of fuqaha&rsquo; in \r\n    several ways, such as the following:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The bank is in charge of \r\n    selling the product that was bought from it, to whomever it wants, whereas \r\n    when the mustawriq is the one who is in charge of selling when he enters \r\n    into a tawarruq transaction by himself, and the first seller has nothing to \r\n    do with the sale of the product to the final purchaser.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>There is prior agreement \r\n    between the bank and the final purchaser which guarantees that he will \r\n    purchase whatever the bank offers at the price for which the bank bought it, \r\n    as stated above, whereas in individual tawarruq, the mustawriq is the one \r\n    who sells the item for the price that he paid for it, or more or less.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Organized tawarruq comes under \r\n    the heading of bay&rsquo; al-&lsquo;eenah which is haraam, because the bank is the \r\n    source of cash for the mustawriq in both cases.

Its capital is 15 billion riyals \r\n    and it does not have any debts at the moment, but it has signed an agreement \r\n    with a group of banks to obtain financing for 4.8 billion riyals to cover \r\n    the cost of project building. According to what is mentioned in their \r\n    prospectus, some of this financing is in the form of loans with interest \r\n    from riba-based banks, although the larger part of it will be through \r\n    Islamic investment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This website adopts the opinion that it is haraam to buy \r\n    shares in companies that deal with haraam, whether borrowing or lending, \r\n    even if their activities are permissible in general. See the answer to \r\n    question no. [fatin]45929[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among those who have ruled that it is haraam to buy shares in \r\n    the company mentioned is Dr. Muhammad al-&lsquo;Usaymi (may Allaah preserve him) \r\n    who said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Praise be to Allaah and blessings and peace be upon the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The activities of this company are in petrochemical \r\n    manufacturing, which is a permissible activity and is essential to the Saudi \r\n    economy. I have read the prospectus and it is clear to me that the company \r\n    does not at the present time have any haraam loans or investments, rather it \r\n    states that the money it has in the bank is 15 billion riyals in Islamic \r\n    investments that gives a return of 4.5%. I am well known for having \r\n    reservations about the way many commercial banks offer Islamic products \r\n    through &ldquo;Islamic service counters&rdquo; in the form of investments that are not \r\n    based on proper shar&rsquo;i guidelines, rather they are superficial in many of \r\n    their operations, especially when the money involved is huge amounts that \r\n    the available investment products cannot fully absorb. Still, I appreciate \r\n    such blessed efforts and believe that they are a step in the right \r\n    direction. But the prospectus has declared the company&rsquo;s intention to take \r\n    both interest-based and Islamic loans from commercial banks. Although the \r\n    prospectus expresses thanks that Islamic banks and local, regional and \r\n    international banks, in addition to some governmental and semi-governmental \r\n    bodies, are expected to contribute to the financing of this project, \r\n    focusing on increasing the share of the Islamic banks in financing, the news \r\n    mentioned on the website confirms that the company is taking this direction \r\n    in borrowing and that the financing will not be purely Islamic.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because this prospectus, as far as I am concerned, is a \r\n    proposal from the company to potential investors, and as it contains what \r\n    has been mentioned above, I think that it is not right for a Muslim to be a \r\n    part of this contract or to accept it or appoint someone to act as his agent \r\n    in such dealings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, it is not permissible to invest in this \r\n    company.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I would like to take this opportunity to call on the people \r\n    in charge of this company and others to avoid haraam loans and haraam \r\n    investments. Islamic alternatives &ndash; praise be to Allaah &ndash; are available and \r\n    are sufficient. I would also like to remind them to fear Allaah with regard \r\n    to that which has been entrusted to them and about which He will ask them on \r\n    the Day of Resurrection.

The former is called a mudaarabah transaction, in which \r\n    the profits are shared according to whatever he has agreed upon with the \r\n    owners of the money. It may be 20% or more or less, but the rate must be \r\n    stipulated in the mudaarabah contract.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for losses, he does not \r\n    bear any of them; the losses are borne entirely by the owner of the capital, \r\n    and the worker loses his work and effort, unless the loss is due to some \r\n    shortcoming or transgression on the part of the worker, in which case he has \r\n    to bear the loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If it is stipulated in the \r\n    mudaarabah contract that any loss or part of it &ndash; such as 50% - is to be \r\n    borne by the worker, then this condition is invalid and there is a \r\n    difference of scholarly opinion as to whether the contract itself is valid \r\n    or invalid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you are contributing \r\n    both your wealth and your work, then the profits are to be shared according \r\n    to the agreement, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for losses, they are to \r\n    be borne according to the capital invested. If you put in one-tenth of the \r\n    capital, for example, then you must bear one-tenth of the loss; if you put \r\n    in one half of the capital, then you must bear one half of the loss, and so \r\n    on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the comments of the \r\n    scholars about the worker in a mudaarabah contract not having to bear any \r\n    financial loss, and the partners bearing losses according to their shares \r\n    are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (5\/22): The loss is to be borne \r\n    by each partner according to his share of the wealth; if the shares (of two \r\n    partners) were equal then they each bear half of the loss. If there were \r\n    three shares then they each bear one third of the loss. We do not know of \r\n    any difference of scholarly opinion concerning this matter, and it is the \r\n    view of Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The loss in a mudaarabah \r\n    contract affects the (invested) money only, and the worker does not bear any \r\n    loss, because the loss affects the capital, which has to do with the owner \r\n    of that capital, and the worker has nothing to do with it, so the loss \r\n    affects the investor&rsquo;s wealth only; but they share any growth that takes \r\n    place. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He also said: If it is \r\n    stipulated that the worker is liable for the money or for part of any loss, \r\n    this condition is invalid, and we do not know of any dissenting opinion, but \r\n    the contract is still valid. This was stated by Ahmad and it was the view of \r\n    Abu Haneefah and Maalik.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Ahmad \r\n    that the contract is invalidated thereby, and this was narrated from \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because it is an invalid condition which invalidates the \r\n    mudaarabah contract.

Thus \r\n    sales and purchases happen repeatedly to the same thing before taking \r\n    possession of it until the deal reaches the final purchaser, who may want to \r\n    take possession of the goods from the first seller, who sold what he did not \r\n    possess, or ask for the difference in the price at the time of delivery, \r\n    which is the time when things are settled, at the time when the role of the \r\n    buyers and sellers, apart from the first and last ones, is limited to taking \r\n    the difference in price when there is a profit or paying the difference when \r\n    there is a loss, at the time of delivery as mentioned above, which is \r\n    exactly what happens among gamblers.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>What is done by financiers of \r\n    monopolizing shares, bonds and commodities in the market in order to control \r\n    the sellers who sold what they did not possess in the hope of buying before \r\n    the appointed delivery time at a lower price and still deliver on time, and \r\n    trying to put them in a difficult situation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (v)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The danger of the financial \r\n    market becomes a means of affecting the markets in general, because prices \r\n    in it are not based on real supply and demand on the part of those who need \r\n    to sell and buy, rather they are based on many things, some of which are \r\n    artificial, deliberate acts on the part of those who are dominating the \r\n    markets or those who have monopolies on commodities or bonds, such as \r\n    spreading false rumours and the like. Here resides the danger that is \r\n    forbidden in Islam, because that leads to unnatural fluctuations in prices, \r\n    which may affect economic life in a bad way.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the stock market has produced a lot of arguments and \r\n    debates among economists, the reason being that during certain periods in \r\n    the world&rsquo;s economic history, it has caused the loss of huge amounts of \r\n    wealth in a short period of time, and it has caused others to become rich \r\n    with the minimum of effort.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For all these reasons, after studying the facts about the \r\n    market for bonds and commodities (the stock market) and the immediate and \r\n    deferred transactions in shares, bonds, commodities and currencies that are \r\n    conducted in it, and discussing that in the light of Islamic shar&rsquo;i rulings, \r\n    the Islamic Fiqh Council has determined the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The aim of the stock market is to create a permanent market \r\n    in which there will be supply and demand, and traders buying and selling. \r\n    This is something that is good and useful, and it prevents professionals \r\n    from cheating the inexperienced. But this advantage of the stock exchange is \r\n    accompanied by a number of things concerning which there are shar&rsquo;i \r\n    reservations, as well as gambling, exploitation and consuming people&rsquo;s \r\n    wealth unlawfully. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence it is not possible to give a general shar&rsquo;i ruling \r\n    concerning it, rather it is essential to explain the rulings on the various \r\n    types of transaction that are conducted in it, each one on its own.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to deferred deals involving goods which are \r\n    actually present and in the seller&rsquo;s possession, in cases where it is \r\n    stipulated by sharee&rsquo;ah that payment or transfer of goods must occur in the \r\n    same sitting where the deal is done &ndash; these are permissible transactions so \r\n    long as they are not transactions in haraam things. But if the sold item is \r\n    not in the possession of the seller, then the conditions of the salam \r\n    (forward buying) transaction must be fulfilled.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The immediate transactions in institutional and company \r\n    shares, where the shares are in the seller&rsquo;s possession, are permissible, so \r\n    long as the field of activity of those companies or institutions is not \r\n    haraam, such as riba-based banks and alcohol companies; in that case it is \r\n    haraam to deal in their shares, whether buying or selling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Both immediate and deferred transactions in bonds which \r\n    involve interest, of all kinds, are not permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah, \r\n    because they are transactions that deal with haraam riba.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Deferred transactions of various kinds which take place in an \r\n    open manner, i.e. in shares and commodities that are not in the seller&rsquo;s \r\n    possession, in the manner in which it is done in the stock market, are not \r\n    permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah, because it is narrated in a saheeh \r\n    report that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not sell what you do not possess.&rdquo; And Imam Ahmad and \r\n    Abu Dawood narrated with a saheeh isnaad from Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) forbade selling goods in the place where they were bought until \r\n    the merchants had moved them to their own location.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sixthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Deferred transactions in the stock market are not like the \r\n    salam transaction which is permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah, because there \r\n    are two differences between them:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>In the stock market, the price \r\n    in deferred transactions is not paid in the same sitting where the deal is \r\n    done<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>In the stock market, the \r\n    product which is the subject of the deal is sold many times whilst still in \r\n    the possession of the first seller and before the first purchaser acquires \r\n    it, and the aim behind that is only to take or pay the difference in price \r\n    between sales and purchases that are not real (i.e., on paper only), and are \r\n    done on a basis of risk to make a profit, exactly as in the case of \r\n    gambling, whereas it is not permissible to sell the item in a salam \r\n    transaction before taking possession of it.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, the Islamic Fiqh Council thinks that \r\n    those who are in charge in Muslim countries should not give the stock \r\n    exchanges in their countries free rein to deal as it wishes with \r\n    transactions and deals, whether they are permissible or haraam, and not \r\n    leave them to those who tinker with prices and do what they want. Rather \r\n    they should oblige people to pay attention to the shar&rsquo;i, permissible \r\n    methods of doing deals and prevent deals which are not permissible according \r\n    to sharee&rsquo;ah, so as to prevent the kind of tinkering which leads to \r\n    financial disaster and ruins the public economy, causing calamity for many, \r\n    because all goodness is in adhering to the way of Islamic sharee&rsquo;ah in all \r\n    things. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and \r\n    follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. \r\n    This He has ordained for you that you may become Al&#8209;Muttaqoon (the pious)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:153]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the source of strength and the One who guides \r\n    to the straight path.

So long as the transaction \r\n    is in your name, your giving the money to your brother is by way of a loan. \r\n    So if you buy the shares from the bank for 100,000 &ndash; for example &ndash; and you \r\n    sell them for 90,000, you are lending 90,000 to your brother, and he is \r\n    taking responsibility for the remaining ten thousand that belonged to the \r\n    bank, which you had to pay because of him. If the lender is doing a favour \r\n    to the borrower, he should not be penalised for that. <i>&ldquo;No ground (of \r\n    complaint) can there be against the Muhsinoon (good-doers)&rdquo; [al-Tawbah 9:91]<\/i>. \r\n    This is not regarded as a loan that brings a benefit, because in fact it \r\n    does not bring you any benefit except in the Hereafter, in sha Allah. \r\n    Concerning the reward for giving a loan, the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no Muslim who lends something to another \r\n    Muslim twice, but it will be like giving charity once.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn \r\n    Maajah (2430); by Ibn Hibbaan in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>; and by al-Bayhaqi in a \r\n    marfoo&lsquo; mawqoof report.

Dr. Muhammad &lsquo;Abd al-Haleem &lsquo;Umar said in his paper <i>\r\n    at-Tafaaseel al-&lsquo;Amaliyyah li &lsquo;Aqd al-Muraabahah<\/i>, which was published in \r\n    the fifth edition of <i>Majallat Majma&lsquo; al-Fiqh al-Islami<\/i>: \r\n    <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Muraabahah may be \r\n    done in one of two ways that were defined in classical fiqh.

This is when someone buys an item for a \r\n    certain price, then he sells it to another person for the original price \r\n    plus an extra amount of profit. In this case he is buying it for himself \r\n    without any prior request from anyone else, then he offers it for sale on \r\n    the basis of muraabahah.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>-2-<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This has recently \r\n    been called &ldquo;muraabahah transaction for one who issued instructions to buy.&rdquo; \r\n    How this is done is as follows: one person goes to another and says to him: \r\n    Buy a particular item which is present (in the market) &ndash; or he gives a \r\n    description of it &ndash; and I will buy it from you for the price you bought it \r\n    for, and I will add a certain amount or percentage of the first price as \r\n    profit. Although this kind has been called &ldquo;muraabahah transaction for one \r\n    who issued instructions to buy&rdquo; by contemporary fuqaha&rsquo;, the way it is done \r\n    has been described by the earlier fuqaha&rsquo;, as is mentioned in <i>al-Umm<\/i> \r\n    by ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i, in which it says: If one man shows an item to another man \r\n    and says: Buy this and I will give you such and such profit for it, and the \r\n    man buys it, this purchase is permissible. Then he said: The same applies if \r\n    he says: Buy something for me &ndash; and he describes it &ndash; or buy any item you \r\n    want and I will give you a profit for it, all of that is the same and the \r\n    transaction is permissible. End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&ldquo;muraabahah \r\n    transaction for one who issued instructions to buy&rdquo; is permissible on \r\n    condition that the one who is instructed to make the purchase buys the item \r\n    for himself and takes possession of it in a real sense before he sells it to \r\n    the one who gave those instructions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It says in <i>\r\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (13\/153): If someone asks another person \r\n    to buy a specific car or a car that meets the description he gives, and he \r\n    promises to buy it from him, and the one who was asked to do so buys it and \r\n    takes possession of it, it is permissible for the one who asked him to do \r\n    that to buy it from him after that, whether for cash or by instalments, for \r\n    a stated amount of profit. This does not come under the heading of selling \r\n    what one does not possess, because the one who was asked for the product is \r\n    only selling it to him after buying it and taking possession of it. But he \r\n    does not have the right to sell it to his friend, for example, before he has \r\n    bought it or after he has bought it and before he has taken possession of \r\n    it, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade \r\n    selling an item in the place where it was bought, until after the merchants \r\n    have taken it to their own places.

After \r\n    listening to the discussions on this topic between fuqaha&rsquo; and economists, \r\n    and referring to the definition of credit cards in its statement no. 63\/1\/7, \r\n    which defined an uncovered credit card as &ldquo;a document given by the issuer \r\n    (the issuing bank) to a person or entity (the cardholder) on the basis of a \r\n    contract which enables the cardholder to purchase goods or services from \r\n    anyone who accepts this document (the business) without paying money \r\n    straight away because the issuer is committed to paying and payment is made \r\n    from the issuer&rsquo;s account; the issuer then charges the cardholder who is \r\n    obliged to pay by a certain deadline. Some of them impose interest or riba \r\n    on the entire unpaid balance after a specified length of time from the date \r\n    of billing, and some do not impose interest.

In that case, if it serves the \r\n    interests of the Muslims, it is permissible to copy it, so as to ward off \r\n    harm.

This is \r\n    a form of loaning with interest, which is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason for that is that a loan means giving money or \r\n    property to someone to benefit from it and then give it back.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The money that is given to the landlord will be returned \r\n    after the agreed lease period ends, so this money is a loan, and the lender \r\n    benefits from this loan by making use of the house until his money is \r\n    returned to him. So this deal is in fact a loan which brings a benefit, and \r\n    the scholars are agreed that every loan which brings a benefit to the lender \r\n    is haraam, because it is a type of riba.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i> (6\/436):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Every loan in which it \r\n    is stipulated that something extra be given (when paying back) is haraam, \r\n    with no dispute. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They are unanimously agreed that if \r\n    the lender stipulates that the borrower should give something extra or give \r\n    him a gift, and he gives the loan on that basis, then taking the extra \r\n    amount is riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn \r\n    Mas&rsquo;ood that they forbade loans that bring benefits. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>al-Sharh<\/i> <i>al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 4\/64:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>An example of benefits \r\n    as a condition of a loan is when a man comes to another man and says: &ldquo;I \r\n    want you to lend me one hundred thousand,&rdquo; and he says, &ldquo;But I will live in \r\n    your house for a month.&rdquo; Here the loan brings a benefit to the lender so it \r\n    is haraam and is not permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle concerning loans is that they are an act \r\n    of kindness towards the borrower, but if conditions are introduced it \r\n    becomes a kind of business deal, and if it is a kind of business deal then \r\n    it involves riba al-fadl and riba al-nasee&rsquo;ah. So for example if someone \r\n    borrows one hundred thousand from me and I stipulate that I will live in his \r\n    house for a month, then it is as if I sold him one hundred thousand in \r\n    return for something extra, which is my living in the house for a month. \r\n    This is riba nasee&rsquo;ah because it is a delay in handing over what has been \r\n    borrowed, and it is riba al-fadl because it involves giving something \r\n    extra.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the scholars said that every loan that brings a benefit \r\n    is riba. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (3\/266):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The conditions of a loan \r\n    being valid:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The first condition: the lender should not benefit. If the \r\n    lender benefits form giving the loan either by stipulating conditions in the \r\n    contract or otherwise, then if it is by stipulating conditions then it is \r\n    haraam without any scholarly dispute on that point&hellip; end quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Attention should be paid to what a contract really involves \r\n    in spite of what it is called. In fact this contract &ndash; as stated above &ndash; is \r\n    a loan that brings benefits, and this is a kind of riba. The fact that \r\n    people call it renting does not alter the fact at all, and does not change \r\n    the ruling thereon. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) told us that some people among his ummah would drink khamr (alcohol) \r\n    and call it by another name.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So beware of making halaal things that are haraam. Paying a \r\n    small amount as rent does not make this haraam action permissible, because \r\n    the larger amount that is paid is still a loan that brings a benefit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The owner of the money has not paid the larger amount of \r\n    money (the loan) which will come back to him for any purpose other than to \r\n    make use of the house, and the owner of the house has not given the house to \r\n    the other person to use except in return for the loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Nothing is hidden from Allaah, and He has punished the one \r\n    who makes haraam things halaal by means of trickery with a swift punishment, \r\n    as happened in the story of the Sabbath-breakers (see al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:47 and \r\n    al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:163).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8304","question_id":"8304","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Custom dictates that the person whose name is written on the \r\n    contract papers is the contract holder, and if that is the case then you are \r\n    the contract holdr and you must fulfil the contract, because Allaah has \r\n    enjoined fulfilment of contracts.

The scholars have stated that in order for a contract to be \r\n    valid, there are several conditions, such as that the usage be permissible, \r\n    so it is not permissible to rent a house to one who will make it into a \r\n    church or a store for selling alcohol. If it is rented for such purposes \r\n    then the contract is not valid, because the usage is not permissible. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Sales of things which be used \r\n    for haraam purposes are not valid, such as selling grapes to one who will \r\n    use them to make wine, if that is known, as is the view of Ahmad and others, \r\n    or suspected, as in one of the two views narrated from him. This is \r\n    supported by the fact that our companions said: If the landlord thinks that \r\n    the renter is renting the house for sinful purposes such as selling wine and \r\n    the like, then it is not permissible for him to rent that house to him, and \r\n    the rental contract is not valid. Sales and rentals are the same.

If the haraam usage is mentioned in the rental \r\n    contract or is known from circumstantial evidence, the contract is invalid. \r\n    So it is not permissible to rent it out to him, and the landlord of the \r\n    house may prevent the dhimmi renter from selling wine in rented premises \r\n    because it is a sin.

With regard to the luggage \r\n    that a person brings with him, reference should be made to the conditions; \r\n    if there are no conditions then the reference point is what is customary. As \r\n    for the fee, whether that is for transporting people or goods, the reference \r\n    point is also the conditions, otherwise it is what is customary.

One of the things in which many people go against \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, causing them a lot of problems, is not defining the period of \r\n    rental, because defining the period of rental prevents disputes and protects \r\n    the rights of both sides; it obliges the landlord to let the tenant stay in \r\n    the property and it obliges the tenant to pay the rent to the landlord for \r\n    the duration of the rental period, and it obliges him to adhere to the terms \r\n    of the lease and pay the rent even if he does not use the property.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact \r\n    that it is permissible to rent out property.

This is like the accommodation that is provided by the university to its \r\n    students; they have the right to make live in it but they do not possess the \r\n    right to benefit from it, and if a student does not need the accommodation \r\n    he does not have the right to rent it out to someone else.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if neither of the two possibilities is stated \r\n    in the contract, then it is essential to ask the company.

It is \r\n    permissible to rent or hire out anything that can be used in permissible \r\n    ways but still remains, such as land, houses, slaves, animals, clothing, \r\n    pavilions, ropes, tents, bags, lamps, reins, swords, spears and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (1\/263) it says: Renting \r\n    or hiring out items of which ownership is shared with others: if the item in \r\n    question is shared and one of the two partners wants to rent out the benefit \r\n    of his share of it, then it is permissible for him to rent it out to his \r\n    partner, according to scholarly consensus. With regard to renting out to \r\n    someone other than one&rsquo;s partner, then according to the majority of Hanafis, \r\n    Shaafa&lsquo;is and Maalikis, and according to one report narrated by Ahmad, this \r\n    is also permissible, because renting or hiring is one kind of transaction, \r\n    so it is permissible to rent out shared property just as it is permissible \r\n    to sell it, and shared property may be benefitted from by turns [i.e., each \r\n    partner may benefit from it for a certain period]. Hence it is permissible \r\n    to sell it. It says in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>: Abu Hafs al-&lsquo;Akbari favoured the \r\n    view that it is permissible to rent out shared property to someone other \r\n    than one&rsquo;s partner. Ahmad suggested that, because it is in his possession \r\n    and he could rent it out to his partner, therefore he could rent it out to \r\n    others, like selling. And because it is permissible if both partners do that \r\n    together, so it is permissible for one of them to do that with his share on \r\n    his own, as is also the case with selling.

But if there is \r\n    a particular reason for hiring that specific person, then giving the job to \r\n    someone else is not permissible. For example, if you hired someone to copy \r\n    out <i>Zaad al-Mustaqni&lsquo;<\/i> (a book of Hanbali fiqh) for you, and you know \r\n    that this man has good handwriting or makes few mistakes, then he hired \r\n    someone who has beautiful handwriting to copy it for a lower price, the \r\n    scholars say that this is not permissible because what matters is copying \r\n    properly, not just beautiful handwriting. Rather what matters is beautiful \r\n    handwriting, proper punctuation and minimum errors. How many people have the \r\n    most beautiful handwriting but they make too many mistakes. Many students \r\n    have good handwriting but they do not follow the rules of writing; many \r\n    people have poor handwriting that no one can read except one who is used to \r\n    it, but there are no errors in his writing.

Undoubtedly women&rsquo;s going \r\n    out of their homes and mixing with men and speaking softly to them whilst \r\n    wearing their finest adornments are all among the greatest causes of fitan. \r\n    Concerning this the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;I have not left behind me any fitnah more harmful to men than women.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5096). And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Beware of this world and beware of women, for the \r\n    first fitnah (trial) among the Children of Israel had to do with women.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated byMuslim (2742).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we examine reality we will become even more certain of the \r\n    truth of what the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said, who did not speak on the basis of whims and desires but was given \r\n    Revelation. Nations and societies &ndash; Islamic and non-Islamic &ndash; whose women \r\n    went out of the home and mixed with men gained nothing from that but evil, \r\n    moral decline and a lot of illegitimate children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Recent statistics show that for the first time in history the \r\n    rate of illegitimate births in Britain has surpassed that of births that \r\n    occurred within the bounds of marriage, and this is a lesson for those who \r\n    pay heed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In America statistics show that between 70 and 90% of female \r\n    employees have committed zina. <i>Al-Da&rsquo;wah<\/i> magazine, issue no. 1783.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some wise men warned against that, but nobody has enough \r\n    wisdom to listen and learn. The famous English writer, Lady Cooke, said in \r\n    the Echo newspaper:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The more mixing there is, the more illegitimate children \r\n    there are. It is no secret that this is a great calamity for women. O \r\n    fathers, do not be tempted by a few pennies that your daughters may earn \r\n    when working in factories and the like, when you know how they are going to \r\n    end up. Teach them how to keep away from men as statistics tell us that \r\n    calamities resulting from fornication increase when there is more mixing \r\n    between men and women. Don&rsquo;t you see that most of the mothers of \r\n    illegitimate children are those who work in factories or as servants in \r\n    houses, and those women who are more exposed to men? Were it not for doctors \r\n    who give prescriptions to cause abortions, we would have seen many times \r\n    more illegitimate children than the numbers we see now.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>al-Islam Rooh al-Madaniyyah<\/i> by \r\n    Mustafa al-Ghalaayeeni (p. 212)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam enjoins on women that which will best protect their \r\n    chastity and protect society from that which may harm it. For example, it \r\n    forbids speaking out loud in front of men who are non-mahrams, unless there \r\n    is an urgent need for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In congregational prayer, if the imam makes a mistake, men \r\n    should draw attention to it by saying tasbeeh, and women by clapping, so \r\n    that they will not speak out loud in the gathering of men, even though they \r\n    are engaged in an act of worship that is the greatest act of worship in \r\n    Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The woman who is in ihraam for Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah should not say \r\n    the Talbiyah out loud, rather it should be at a level where only her female \r\n    companions can hear her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly, working as a broadcaster is absolutely contrary \r\n    to that, because thousands or hundreds of thousands of men who are \r\n    non-mahrams can hear her, without there being any urgent need for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have seen and heard female broadcasters presenting the \r\n    news and presenting programs on sports and economics and religion. What is \r\n    the need for that? Aren&rsquo;t there men who can do this job better?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we look at a woman&rsquo;s work as a broadcaster on television, \r\n    we will see that it involves a number of things that are contrary to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Mixing with non-mahram men, such as the cameraman, director, \r\n    producer and others who work with her; she may often end up being alone with \r\n    one of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The need to uncover her face, with makeup and adornment which \r\n    is the finest it can be. Allaah says of old women (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, \r\n    it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as \r\n    not to show their adornment&rdquo; [al-Noor 24:60]<\/i>. So how can it be \r\n    permissible for a young woman to appear with full adornment before hundreds \r\n    of thousands of non-mahram men?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Many of them make their speech soft, and all of them have \r\n    beautiful voices &ndash; which is one of the main reasons why they are chosen to \r\n    be broadcasters. A woman&rsquo;s beautiful voice is a cause of fitnah, so how \r\n    about if she also makes it soft and alluring? Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a \r\n    disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with \r\n    desire&rdquo; [al-Ahzaab 33:32]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for a woman to address men who are not \r\n    her mahrams except in cases of necessity, and with a voice which is not \r\n    attractive and she should not speak to them any more than is necessary.

Moreover it is well known that a woman who works in \r\n    broadcasting strives to make her voice beautiful and makes it soft and \r\n    alluring. This is also something which must be avoided because of the fitnah \r\n    involved. Among men there are both young and old who could do the job.

The \r\n    student may benefit from these activities more than the lesson itself.

He has to combine the two interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the activities that he does are not important, or someone \r\n    else is giving them sufficient attention, or he is giving them too much \r\n    attention and wasting time with them, at the expense of doing his job in the \r\n    classroom, then undoubtedly this is neglecting his duty and betraying the \r\n    trust. <i>&ldquo;And Allaah knows him who means mischief from him who means good&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Baqarah 2:220]<\/i>. He should fear Allaah and get his priorities \r\n    straight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Explaining the importance of activities and the obligation of \r\n    cooperating in organizing them, Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) \r\n    said:&nbsp; We should cooperate and help one another in important matters that \r\n    are needed in the school, such as preparing articles, researching issues, \r\n    taking part in school activities, writing announcements, messages and advice \r\n    to inspire the school and its members to advance, giving a strong impression \r\n    to visitors of the strength of its activities, advice and ideas. Undoubtedly \r\n    this cannot be achieved by one or two people, and the principal should not \r\n    neglect this aspect and sit alone in the office and limit himself to making \r\n    each teacher teach his subject in the classroom; rather he must do more than \r\n    that, and encourage more student activities, and motivate them to do \r\n    righteous deeds, and encourage the students, teachers and employees to \r\n    cooperate with one another, and make some effort and spend some time on \r\n    writing memos and the like which will attract attention and impress \r\n    visitors, and demonstrate their sincerity towards students and others. If \r\n    the principal of the school does not do that, then the teachers should offer \r\n    suggestions and show their willingness to cooperate with him in the \r\n    interests of all. If the principal asks them or some of them to do some \r\n    tasks, then they should hasten to fulfil that request. This is something \r\n    that is required of everyone, and it comes under the heading of cooperating \r\n    in righteousness and piety. If money is needed to sponsor these activities, \r\n    then it is the duty of the one who is able to hasten to do that. Similarly \r\n    if the principal asks one of them to buy something important in the \r\n    interests of the school, and he is one who knows how to buy it and it is not \r\n    a great hardship, then it is the duty of brotherhood and friendship to \r\n    respond to the request and not limit himself to giving lessons inside the \r\n    classroom. Although that is his basic duty, there are other activities that \r\n    may be connected to this activity. It is known that the teacher&rsquo;s working \r\n    hours are like those of any other worker; he should be available for the \r\n    whole time, from beginning to end. So if he is employed full-time, he should \r\n    not disdain to work with others in the interests of all.

Indeed, the physical education teacher has a \r\n    great role to play in influencing the students&rsquo; behaviour and attitude. He \r\n    is close to them because he does something with them that they love, and he \r\n    can make the most of his position with them to teach them good attitudes and \r\n    how to interact with others in a good manner, and he can remind them to pray \r\n    regularly and on time, and do other duties, in addition to the physical and \r\n    health benefits that the students may gain from this subject, if the teacher \r\n    is sincere in his work and does not fall short in his duties towards Allaah \r\n    and towards other people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in <i>al-Liqa&rsquo; al-Shahri<\/i> \r\n    (14\/question no. 6):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I call on my brothers who practise these sports to adhere to \r\n    Islam.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The purpose of sport is to train the body to move and become \r\n    strong and healthy, and to become able to carry heavy objects and put up \r\n    with hardship, because a person may need to rely on himself sometimes, and \r\n    if he has physical strength he will be able to walk on his own two feet for \r\n    a day or several days, and he will be able to carry his luggage and supplies \r\n    and food on his head, and save himself from doom. It has happened that some \r\n    people&rsquo;s bus broke down in the desert and they were a day and night&rsquo;s walk \r\n    from the nearest town, and not one of them was able to save himself, so they \r\n    all died, and there were about forty of them. Hence we think that \r\n    governments should train their troops, workers and young people to walk and \r\n    run and carry heavy objects, and to put up with hunger and the like. This is \r\n    the benefit of sports and physical training, and this is what the sports \r\n    player gets used to through training his body to move and bear hardship. But \r\n    as for interviewing players and watching them on audio or video broadcasts \r\n    or following news that is published about them, I think that this is not \r\n    important, rather it is a waste of time and financial resources, and a \r\n    blatant loss, because of the evils, envy, competition, travelling for long \r\n    distances and great expense involved, in addition to the fact that it does \r\n    not bring any benefit to the spectator, because when he goes to watch \r\n    matches and buys a ticket, and he sits waiting and then watching for several \r\n    hours, then at the end he is faced with the crowds and dangers, and there \r\n    are sometimes traffic accidents and the like, all of that is evil and \r\n    harmful and dangerous, which has no benefit. What benefit can he gain from \r\n    watching these players and reading the newspapers that carry reports about \r\n    them, and spending a lot of money on them and a lot of time reading them and \r\n    following news of them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We advise the trainers and sportsmen to encourage the \r\n    students of physical education to enter fields and competitions and to \r\n    learn, and to warn them against wasting time on reading, listening and \r\n    watching, or following news that is of no importance. Thus they will guide \r\n    them to that which is beneficial and steer them away from that which is \r\n    harmful. It is not permissible to praise the kuffaar if they become \r\n    prominent in their field and excel in sports, rather we should compete in \r\n    that which will benefit us in this world and in the Hereafter.

It is not \r\n    permissible, according to the majority of fuqaha&rsquo;, to rent out a house for \r\n    purposes that are not acceptable according to sharee&rsquo;ah, such as if the \r\n    renter is going to use it as a place for drinking alcohol or gambling, or he \r\n    is going to make it into a church or place of idol-worship. In that case it \r\n    is haraam to accept the rent and to pay it, because it is helping in sin. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if the practitioner of \r\n    witchcraft is going to use it as a place of residence and you know for \r\n    certain or based on circumstantial evidence that he is not going to use it \r\n    for practising witchcraft and falsehood, then it is permissible to build it \r\n    and paint it, although it is better to keep away from that, because the \r\n    practitioner of witchcraft should be shunned and rebuked, and the community \r\n    should oppose him until he repents from his haraam actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thus the difference is \r\n    clear between the house that is acquired for sinful purposes and the house \r\n    that is acquired to live in.

For the \r\n          opinion of the mujtahid may change from time to time, according to the \r\n          evidence that is available to him and depending on the circumstances. \r\n          &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, when his ijtihaad differed \r\n          concerning matters of inheritance, &ldquo;At that time, that was our decision, \r\n          and this time this is our decision.&rdquo; The ijtihaad of the mujtahid is \r\n          no more than his opinion, which cannot be said to be the ruling of Allaah; \r\n          rather it may coincide with the ruling of Allaah or it may go against \r\n          it. The opinion of everyone except the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace \r\n          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may be accepted or rejected. The \r\n          opinions of the mujtahids cannot be divided into immutable matters and \r\n          variables because they are all open to being changed if it is proven \r\n          that they go against sound evidence. But the rulings of Allaah and His \r\n          religion cannot be changed or altered. So the seekers of knowledge must \r\n          be cautious in their speech and not say anything which opens the way \r\n          for those who follow their whims and desires and who promote false arguments, \r\n          because they (seekers of knowledge) are speaking with the words of the \r\n          scholars and what they say may be taken as evidence concerning matters \r\n          of religion.

These positions also require perfect wisdom,\r\n    reason and alertness, and the testimony of a man has been made equal to that of two women,\r\n    the reason for which Allaah has explained in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;&hellip;\r\n    so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Baqarah\r\n    2:282]<\/i>. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Imaam al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudaamah said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;For this reason the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) and his successors (khulafa&rsquo;) and those who came after them\r\n    never appointed a woman to be a judge or a governor of a province, as far as we know.

Because of their weakness,\r\n    women are not able to do many things. Women are imperfect, and the positions of leaders\r\n    and judge are among the most perfect of positions for which only the most perfect of men\r\n    are qualified.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Undoubtedly this is proven by reality. People know from\r\n    experience that only men are fit for leadership, because women by nature are more\r\n    emotional and more easily swayed by their feelings and compassion. These qualities have\r\n    been created in women to enable them to carry out their most important duty, which is that\r\n    of motherhood and nurturing children. Men, on the other hand, are not usually swayed by\r\n    their emotions as women are. Their way is usually one of logic and deliberation, which\r\n    form the essence of responsibility and leadership.<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the question of whether a woman may be\r\n    appointed as a judge, the majority of Maaliki, Shaafa&rsquo;i and Hanbali scholars say that\r\n    a woman cannot be appointed as a judge, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of\r\n    Abu Bakrah quoted above.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Ibn al-Teen said: Those who say that a woman cannot be\r\n    appointed as a judge use the hadeeth of Abu Bakrah as evidence, and this is the view of\r\n    the majority.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to other administrative positions, there is no\r\n    shar&rsquo;i reason why women should not be appointed to run institutions where they will\r\n    work with other women and not men, because in this case there are no shar&rsquo;i\r\n    reservations about their work.<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is no validity in what most modern writers say about\r\n    how women have to go out and take part in parliaments and public councils, and that these\r\n    are part of the rights granted to women by Islam.

The hadeeth is general in \r\n    meaning and applies to all positions of public authority. So it is not \r\n    permissible to appoint a woman, because the word &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; is general in \r\n    meaning and includes all the public affairs of the Muslims.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no stern warning greater than stating that they will \r\n    never prosper, and the most important issue is to rule according to the \r\n    rulings of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and therefore this \r\n    warning applies more emphatically to women.

Rather he intended to \r\n    forbid his ummah from imitating those people (the Persians) by delegating \r\n    any of their public affairs to a woman, and he used this incident to convey \r\n    this message to the people who were keen to be prosperous so that they would \r\n    comply with this advice. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) used definitive language to state that lack of prosperity is \r\n    inevitable when a woman is appointed in charge of any affairs. Undoubtedly \r\n    the prohibition that is derived from this hadeeth applies to any woman in \r\n    any era; women are not to be appointed to positions of public authority. \r\n    This general meaning is understood from the wording of the hadeeth. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Moreover, the nature of woman means that a woman should \r\n    not be appointed to a position of public authority.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Fatwa Committee of al-Azhar said, after mentioning the \r\n    arguments based on the hadeeth:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This ruling is based on this hadeeth, which is that the \r\n    ruling that women should not be appointed to positions of public authority \r\n    is not a ruling which is to be followed as a religious ritual without \r\n    necessarily understanding the wisdom behind it, rather it is one of the \r\n    rulings that are based on reasons which are obvious to those who understand \r\n    the differences between the two types of human beings, men and women. This \r\n    ruling is not connected to anything other than the femininity which is \r\n    indicated by the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in the hadeeth. So femininity alone is the \r\n    reason. &hellip; Because of her nature, woman is designed to fulfil the mission for \r\n    which she was created, which is the role of mother and caring for and \r\n    raising children. This means that she is likely to be affected by emotion. \r\n    In addition to that she is faced with natural events that happen repeatedly \r\n    over the months and years, which may weaken her strength and resolve in \r\n    forming opinions and adhering to them and in fighting for them. This is \r\n    something which women themselves cannot deny, and we do not need to quote \r\n    examples and evidence to prove the emotional nature of woman throughout the \r\n    ages. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Practical experience in some countries indicates that \r\n    women are not fit to play the role of judge. When Islam forbade women to be \r\n    appointed to positions of public authority, it brought something that would \r\n    protect people&rsquo;s rights and ward off corruption, which is something that is \r\n    not understood by those who are short-sighted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In one of the Muslim countries the Ministry of Justice opened \r\n    the door for talented women to become judges, but after five years they \r\n    dismissed all of these female judges and banned women from entering the \r\n    graduate school for judges because of their failure despite the \r\n    opportunities they had for learning and training, and despite the fact that \r\n    they got higher grades than the men in the theoretical field.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In another Muslim country women were given the opportunity to \r\n    become judges, but after they failed the state had to remove them from the \r\n    courts to the technical and research fields.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This indicates that women are not qualified to be judges.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; The judge is required to be present among men&rsquo;s \r\n    gatherings and to mix with disputants and witnesses, and may need to be \r\n    alone with them. Islam seeks to protect women and preserve their honour and \r\n    dignity, and protect them from those who would toy with them. So Islam tells \r\n    women to stay in their homes and not go out except in cases of necessity. \r\n    And it forbids them from mixing with men and being alone with them, because \r\n    that poses a threat to women and their honour.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; The position of judge requires a high level of \r\n    intelligence, insight and reason, and women have less of these qualities \r\n    than men, and they have little experience in the affairs of life and \r\n    disputes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In addition to that, women are faced with natural phenomena \r\n    during certain days, months and years, namely menstruation, pregnancy, \r\n    childbirth and breastfeeding etc, which weakens their bodies and affects \r\n    their understanding of things, which is incompatible with the position and \r\n    status of a judge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>Wilaayat al-Mar&rsquo;ah fi&rsquo;l-Fiqh al-Islami<\/i> (p. \r\n    217-250) &ndash; Master&rsquo;s Thesis by Muhammad Anwar.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8390","question_id":"8390","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, it is obligatory for a Muslim woman to strive to \r\n    understand her religion as much as possible, but serving her husband, \r\n    obeying her husband and raising her children are also important obligations.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;She should make time to learn every day, even if it is only \r\n    a little.

If a woman is widowed with children, and has no breadwinner and is\r\n    receiving no money from the <i>Bayt al-Maal<\/i> (treasury), it is permissible for her to\r\n    earn a living. Although we say that a woman is permitted to work outside the home when it\r\n    is necessary, she should nevertheless do only the work she needs to do in order to meet\r\n    her needs. If a woman has professional skills which not every woman possesses, and which\r\n    are needed by other woman and society as a whole, then it is permissible for her to\r\n    practice her profession outside the home, so long as she adheres to the conditions\r\n    prescribed by sharee&rsquo;ah and has the permission of her legal (shar&rsquo;i) guardian.\r\n    The evidence that it is permissible for the woman to work outside the home in a field\r\n    where there is a need for her work, as long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by\r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, is to be seen in the fact that at the time of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), midwives used to attend women in labour, and skilled\r\n    women used to practice circumcision, and he did not condemn them for doing so. It is also\r\n    known that Rufaydah al-Ansaariyyah used to treat the wounded in her tent, which had been\r\n    set up in the mosque for that purpose. She was very skilled in treating the sick, and her\r\n    work was done with the knowledge and express permission of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). Sa&rsquo;d ibn Mu&rsquo;aadh was transferred to her tent\r\n    for treatment. This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to practice her\r\n    profession outside the home, and by analogy we may deduce that it is permissible for a\r\n    female doctor to open a clinic outside her home for the treatment of women and children.\r\n    By doing this, she is fulfilling the duty of fard kifaayah (a duty falling on the entire\r\n    community &ndash; if some people fulfil it, responsibility is lifted from the rest,\r\n    otherwise all will be held accountable. Translator). Such clinics make it easy for sick\r\n    women to come to a female doctor, hence they no longer have to uncover their &lsquo;awrah\r\n    before a male doctor when they need treatment.<\/p>\r\n    <p>But this permission is given on the condition that this work does not\r\n    affect her duties towards her own home, husband and children, and that she has her\r\n    husband&rsquo;s permission, because these duties are her individual duties (<i>fard\r\n    &lsquo;ayn<\/i>), which take precedence over her responsibilities towards the community (<i>fard\r\n    kifaayah<\/i>). When there is any conflict, her individual duties must come first. (<i>Al-Mufassal<\/i>\r\n    by &lsquo;Abd al-Kareem, 4\/272).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Another hadeeth which describes Muslim women at the\r\n    beginning of Islam practising a profession was narrated by Hafsah, concerning a woman who\r\n    used to treat the wounded. Al-Bukhaari, may Allaah have mercy on him, reported in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>\r\n    that Hafsah said: &ldquo;A woman came and stayed at the fort of Bani Khalaf, and told us\r\n    about her sister. Her sister&rsquo;s husband used to go out on military campaigns with the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He had been on twelve campaigns,\r\n    and she (his wife) had accompanied him on six. She said, &lsquo;We used to treat the\r\n    wounded and take care of the sick&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no.\r\n    313).<\/p>\r\n    <p>But a woman&rsquo;s work as a nurse or doctor is\r\n    regulated by the rules indicated in other Islamic texts. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, may Allaah\r\n    have mercy on him, commenting on the above hadeeth, mentioned some of these conditions:\r\n    &ldquo;What we learn from this hadeeth is that a woman is allowed to offer medical\r\n    treatment to a non-mahram man (one to whom she is not related), so long as this takes the\r\n    form of bringing medicine to him, for example, or other forms of indirect treatment (i.e.\r\n    with no touching or direct contact involved) &ndash; except in cases where it is necessary\r\n    and there is no fear of temptation (such as in an emergency situation or in the event of a\r\n    disaster).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a woman works in complete hijaab, without touching a male patient,\r\n    or being alone with him in any way, and as long as there is no fear that she may be the\r\n    cause of temptation or be tempted herself, and she is not neglecting a more essential duty\r\n    such as taking care of her husband or children, and she has the permission of her\r\n    guardian, then it is permissible for her to work. In principle, men should be treated by\r\n    male doctors and nurses, and women by female doctors and nurses. There should be no mixing\r\n    of the sexes in medical treatment, except when it is necessary and as long as there is no\r\n    fear of temptation.

He is \r\n    obliged to denounce this evil and change it and remove it; if he cannot then \r\n    he must leave that place. The basic principle is that the Muslim should shun \r\n    sinful places and keep away from them, and not help the people there to \r\n    disobey Allaah. Staying in such places goes against the command to the \r\n    Muslim to change evil wherever he sees it, and it goes against the command \r\n    to shun places of evil and sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And it \r\n    has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur&rsquo;aan) that when you \r\n    hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with \r\n    them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with \r\n    them) certainly in that case you would be like them.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; \r\n    4:140]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>al-Qurtubi \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him)said: &ldquo;<i>then sit not with them, until they \r\n    engage in a talk other than that<\/i>&rdquo; means, other than kufr. &ldquo;<i>(but if \r\n    you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    this indicates that it is obligatory to avoid keeping company with sinners \r\n    if they openly commit evil, because the one who does not avoid them is \r\n    approving of their actions, and approving of kufr is kufr. Allaah says: &ldquo;<i>(but \r\n    if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    so everyone who sits in a sinful gathering and does not denounce them, \r\n    shares the burden of sin equally with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He should \r\n    denounce them if they speak of sin and commit sin.

He had him beaten in order to \r\n    discipline him, and he recited this verse: &ldquo;<i>certainly in that case you \r\n    would be like them<\/i>&rdquo; i.e., approving of sin is also sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote \r\n    from <i>Tafseer al-Qurtubi<\/i> (5\/418)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Denouncing \r\n    sin in one's heart is obligatory for every one, which means hating and \r\n    despising the evil, and separating from those who commit sin if one is \r\n    unable to denounce it with one's hand or tongue (i.e., by taking action or \r\n    speaking out).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Al-Durar \r\n    al-Saniyyah fi&rsquo;l-Ajwabah al-Najdiyyah<\/i> (16\/142)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover \r\n    there is the fear that the one who works in these places will become weak in \r\n    faith, and may lose all sense of gheerah (protective jealousy), and the \r\n    shaytaan may tempt him to sin.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    stated in the same hadeeth the reason why it is haraam to give him gifts and \r\n    that is because he is appointed to do this job, and this is unlike giving \r\n    gifts to someone other than a worker, which is mustahabb. The ruling on that \r\n    which a worker takes in the name of a gift is that it must be returned to \r\n    the giver, and if that is not possible it must be given to the bayt \r\n    al-maal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Sharh \r\n    Muslim<\/i> (6\/462).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was \r\n    narrated from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Buraydah from his father that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever we appoint to do \r\n    a task and we give him his provision, whatever he takes after that is \r\n    ghulool (stolen booty).&rdquo; What this hadeeth means is: whoever we appoint for \r\n    a task and give him money for that, it is not permissible for him to take \r\n    anything after that.

If it is not permissible, what is the kind of commission that \r\n    is permissible?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Answer: If the manufacturer or trader gives you some money \r\n    for every item that is sold through you, to encourage you to continue to \r\n    look for customers, and this money does not increase the price of the \r\n    product and that does not cause any harm to others who sell this product, \r\n    meaning that this manufacturer or trader sells it for a price like that for \r\n    which it is sold by others &ndash; that this is permissible and there are no \r\n    reservations concerning it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if this money that you take from the owner of the factory \r\n    or store increases the price of the product paid by the purchaser, then this \r\n    is not permissible for you to take it and it is not permissible for the \r\n    seller to do that, because this is harming the purchaser by increasing the \r\n    price for him.

Ibn \r\n    al-Qayyim said: &lsquo;Umar refused it because he thought that the gift was \r\n    because of the loan. When he realized that it was not because of the loan, \r\n    he accepted it.

But if that is because \r\n    the lender and borrower used to do that before this loan, then there is \r\n    nothing wrong with it.

This is what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant when he said: &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t \r\n    he sit in the house of his father and mother and see if he will be given \r\n    anything or not?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; These \r\n    bribes tempt the worker to favour the giver, so that he may give him \r\n    something that he is not entitled to, which will cause harm to the one who \r\n    hired him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; They may \r\n    cause the worker to resent others who do not give him anything, so he does \r\n    not do a good job for them, and falls short in his work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; It may \r\n    make the worker audacious in asking and demanding, and make him expect tips \r\n    and hope for them, which is a bad habit which should be stopped and fought, \r\n    because Islam calls on us to have pride and self-respect, and not to look \r\n    for that which is in the hands of others. Rather Islam forbids us to ask \r\n    except in the case of necessity. Islam does not want a large majority of the \r\n    ummah to become beggars, even if it is in the form of tips. <\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;These \r\n    negative effects may be weighed against the idea of being kind to the worker \r\n    and giving him something extra as a kind of charity if he is poor, or \r\n    responding to his request for more so as to avoid being unkind to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But the \r\n    basic principle according to the scholars is that warding off harm takes \r\n    precedence over seeking benefits. Based on this, it is not permissible to \r\n    give so-called tips, except within narrowly-defined terms that are free of \r\n    these evils, such as if the worker has finished his work and is not expected \r\n    to do any more work for the giver of the tip, so there is no risk of bribery \r\n    or favouritism. In that case it is permissible to give him something by way \r\n    of honouring him or helping him, according to the fatwas issued by some \r\n    scholars, as we shall see below, but it is better not to do that, because \r\n    that may make him get used to asking for or expecting tips, and it may make \r\n    him resent those who do not give him anything.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Examples of \r\n    scholars&rsquo; comments on this issue:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The \r\n    fatwa issued by the Standing Committee (23\/548):&nbsp; What is the Islamic ruling \r\n    on one who is given money when he is at work without him asking for it or \r\n    using any tricks in order to take that money? For example, the mayor or the \r\n    Shaykh of a village, to whom people come for certificates and documents \r\n    because they live in his village, and they give him some money for that. Is \r\n    it permissible to take it? Is this money regarded as permissible? Can we \r\n    take as evidence for it being halaal the hadeeth of Saalim ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Umar, from his father &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar, from &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to give me a stipend and I would say: \r\n    &ldquo;Give it to one who is in greater need of it than me.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Take it, \r\n    for if any of this wealth comes to you when you are not hoping for it and \r\n    asking for it, then take it and keep it, then if you wish you may give it in \r\n    charity, but whatever does not come to you, do not seek it.&rdquo; Saalim said: \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah used not to ask anyone for anything, and he would not reject \r\n    anything that he was given. Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Answer: If \r\n    the situation is as described, whatever is given to this mayor is haraam, \r\n    because it is a bribe. The hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) has nothing to do with this matter, because that has to do with one who \r\n    is given something from the bayt al-maal of the Muslims by the Muslim ruler \r\n    without asking for it or expecting anything. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Shaykh \r\n    Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: We have a banquet \r\n    hall in which there are cooks, and some of the cooks ask for tips in \r\n    addition to their salaries. Is it permissible to give a worker some money as \r\n    a tip, as he is used to taking from people?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: \r\n    If there is a worker who has a salary and is paid a set amount by the boss, \r\n    then it is not permissible for anyone to give him anything, because this \r\n    will make him resent others, as some people are poor and cannot afford to \r\n    give them anything. So doing this is a bad habit.

The \r\n    worker has no right to single out anyone for better service, rather he \r\n    should treat all people in the same manner. But if there is no risk of \r\n    bribery or favouritism being involved in this tip, then there is nothing \r\n    wrong with it in that case, such as if you intend thereby to be kind to this \r\n    poor and needy worker, and you are not going to go back to that restaurant. \r\n    End quote from question no.

As for maintenance, that depends on the child&rsquo;s needs, and it is \r\n    not essential to give each one the same. Whoever is in need of maintenance \r\n    may take it, and whoever does not need it should not take it. It is well \r\n    known that maintenance of a minor is not like maintenance of a grown-up, and \r\n    the maintenance of one who is studying at the primary level is not like \r\n    maintenance of one who is studying at university, and maintenance of a girl \r\n    is not usually like maintenance of a boy. That includes maintenance with \r\n    regard to marriage &ndash; a father may give to one who is about to get married \r\n    what he does not give to one who is not about to get married.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If \r\n    we assume that one of them is in school and needs support with regard to his \r\n    schooling, such as books, exercise books, pens, pencils and the like, and \r\n    the other one does not read, and he is older than him but he is not in need, \r\n    if he gives to the former must he also give to the latter?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that he does not have to, because fairness in \r\n    maintenance means giving each one what he needs. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: if a male child needs a ghutrah (head cover) and \r\n    skullcap that cost one hundred riyals, and a female needs earrings that cost \r\n    one thousand riyals, what is fair?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is: What is fair is to buy the headgear worth one \r\n    hundred riyals for the boy and to buy earrings for the girl that are worth \r\n    ten times more than what he bought for the boy; this is proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example: if one of them needs to get married and the \r\n    other does not need that, what is fair?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that he should give to the one who needs to get \r\n    married and not to the other.

Even for the heirs, it is not permissible \r\n    to carry out this bequest except for those who have reached puberty and are \r\n    of sound mind.

In that case we \r\n    should do that in order to achieve that interest. With regard to that which \r\n    is haraam in and of itself, it is haraam for the one who takes it and for \r\n    others. So for example, if a Jew or a Christian who thinks that wine is \r\n    permissible were to offer me some wine as a gift, it is not permissible for \r\n    me to accept it because it is haraam in and of itself. If a person were to \r\n    steal someone&rsquo;s money and give it to me, it is haraam for me to take this \r\n    stolen money because it is haraam in and of itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This principle dispels a \r\n    great deal of confusion. That which is haraam because of the way in which it \r\n    was acquired is haraam only to the one who acquires it, not to anyone who \r\n    takes it in a permissible manner, unless shunning him and not taking \r\n    anything from him and not accepting his gift or dealing with him will serve \r\n    an interest by deterring him from doing such things; in that case he should \r\n    be shunned in order to achieve that purpose.<\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: See: As&rsquo;ilat al-Baab il-Maftooh, vol. 1, p. 76, by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)."},{"id":"8475","question_id":"8475","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This kind of gift is \r\n    subject to some conditions, which is his saying: If you like this program \r\n    then you can donate to the programmer.

A gift is given with the intention \r\n    of honouring a specific person, either because you love him and he is your \r\n    friend, or because you want something. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to accept gifts and reward people for \r\n    them, so that no one could remind him of their favours, but he did not \r\n    accept the &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; of people that they gave to purify themselves of sins, \r\n    namely charity. He did not accept charity for this and other reasons. Once \r\n    this is understood, then charity is better, but there is a sense in which a \r\n    gift is better than charity, such as giving a gift to the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during his lifetime \r\n    out of love for him, or the gifts which a person gives to a relative in \r\n    order to uphold the ties of kinship, or to a brother in Islam.

The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said to him, &lsquo;Have you done the same for all of your children?&rsquo; He \r\n    said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Fear Allaah and treat your children justly.&rsquo; So my \r\n    father came back and took back that gift.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to a version narrated by Muslim, the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O Basheer, do \r\n    you have any other children?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Have you given all \r\n    of them a similar gift?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Then do not ask me to bear \r\n    witness to this, for I do not bear witness to injustice.&rdquo; The evidence in \r\n    this hadeeth is clear:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The Prophet commanded justice, and a command implies that \r\n    it is obligatory.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; He explained that showing preference to one child or \r\n    singling him out to the exclusion of the others is falsehood and injustice, \r\n    in addition to his refusal to bear witness to it and his commanding him to \r\n    take back his gift. All of that indicates that differentiating between one&rsquo;s \r\n    children is haraam.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They also referred to the evidence of common sense:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Hajar mentioned in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> (5\/214):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the evidence of \r\n    those who say that it is obligatory to treat one&rsquo;s children equally is the \r\n    fact that this (differentiating between children) is the first step that may \r\n    lead to something haraam, because cutting off family ties and disobeying \r\n    one&rsquo;s parents are two things which are haraam, so that which leads to them \r\n    may also be haraam, and differentiating between one&rsquo;s children is something \r\n    that may lead to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is supported by something which was mentioned in a \r\n    version narrated by Muslim (1623): &ldquo;He [the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, &lsquo;Ask someone else to bear witness to \r\n    this.&rsquo; Then he said: &lsquo;Would you like your children to all honour you \r\n    equally?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Of course.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Then do not do this.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Further evidence is the fact that preferring some of them to \r\n    others generates enmity and hatred between them, and also between them and \r\n    their parents, so that is not allowed (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 5\/664); this \r\n    meaning is similar to that mentioned above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who favoured the second opinion, that it is permissible \r\n    to differentiate between one&rsquo;s children when there is a need, a reason or an \r\n    excuse, quoted as evidence the hadeeth narrated by Maalik in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    with his isnaad from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said \r\n    that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq had given her as a gift twenty wisq of his wealth, \r\n    but when he was on his deathbed he said, &ldquo;By Allaah, O my daughter, there is \r\n    no one whom I would like to see rich after I die more than you, and there is \r\n    no one whom it hurts me to see poor after I die than you. I had given you \r\n    twenty wisq, and if you have already gone and collected them, then they are \r\n    yours, otherwise whatever I leave is to be divided among all my heirs, who \r\n    are your two brothers and your two sisters, so divide it amongst yourselves \r\n    according to the Book of Allaah&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Hajar said in <i>al-Fath<\/i> (5\/215): its isnaad is \r\n    saheeh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The evidence from this \r\n    hadeeth, is as Ibn Qudaamah mentioned, &ldquo;It may be that Abu Bakr gave it only \r\n    to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah because she was in need and was unable to earn a living, even \r\n    though she enjoyed a unique status as one of the Mothers of the Believers, \r\n    and other virtues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Adapted from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 5\/665)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As justification for Abu Bakr&rsquo;s action, al-Haafiz said in <i>\r\n    al-Fath<\/i> (2\/215): &ldquo; &lsquo;Urwah said concerning the story of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah that \r\n    her brothers and sisters had agreed to that.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (<i>Kitaab al-&lsquo;Adl bayna al-Awlaad<\/i>, p. 22 ff)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said that it is \r\n    haraam in absolute terms in <i>Ighaathat al-Lahfaan<\/i>, 1\/540. He said: &ldquo;If \r\n    there were no clear saheeh Sunnah reports that disallowed that, then by \r\n    analogy and based on the principles of sharee&rsquo;ah and its concern for \r\n    people&rsquo;s interests and to protect them from evil, it would have to be \r\n    haraam.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) stated that it \r\n    is absolutely forbidden to show preference to some of one&rsquo;s children over \r\n    others, and that it is obligatory to treat them all equally, males and \r\n    females alike, in accordance with their shares of inheritance, unless they \r\n    give permission and are adults of sound mind. (<i>al-Fataawa al-Jaami&rsquo;ah \r\n    li&rsquo;l-Mar&rsquo;ah al-Muslimah<\/i>, 3\/1115, 1116)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: it \r\n    is not permissible for a man to give some of his sons preferential treatment \r\n    over others, but he may differentiate between males and females, giving the \r\n    males double what he gives the females, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Fear Allaah and treat your children \r\n    fairly.&rdquo; So if he gives one of his sons 100 dirhams, he has to give the \r\n    other sons 100 dirhams each as well, and give the girls 50 dirhams each, or \r\n    else take back the money that he gave to the first son. This that we have \r\n    mentioned is to be applied in cases other than the spending which is \r\n    obligatory; with regard to obligatory spending, he should give each one \r\n    whatever he needs. So if it so happens that one of his sons needs to get \r\n    married, and he gets him married and gives him the mahr because the son is \r\n    not able to pay the mahr, then in this case he does not have to give all the \r\n    other sons the same as he gave to the one who needed to get married, because \r\n    getting one&rsquo;s children married is part of spending on them. Here I want to \r\n    draw attention to something that some people do out of ignorance, which is \r\n    when a man has sons who have reached marriageable age, he gets them married, \r\n    and he has other children who are still small, he makes a will saying that \r\n    in the event of his death, they should be given money equal to that which \r\n    was spent on the adult children. This is haraam and is not permissible \r\n    because this will is a will that gives something to an heir, and willing \r\n    something to an heir is haraam, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah has given everyone his due, \r\n    so there is no will for an heir.&rdquo; (This version narrated by Abu Dawood, \r\n    3565; al-Tirmidhi, 2\/16 and others. The isnaad of this version was classed \r\n    as hasan by al-Albaani, and the version &ldquo;There is no will for an heir&rdquo; was \r\n    classed as saheeh in <i>al-Irwa&rsquo;<\/i>, 6\/87). So if he says, &ldquo;I am leaving \r\n    this money for them in my will because I got their brothers married for a \r\n    similar amount,&rdquo; we say that if these young children reach marriageable age \r\n    before you die, then get them married for the same amount of money as you \r\n    got their brothers married, but if they do not reach that age (before you \r\n    die) then you do not have to get them married.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, 3\/30.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"8497","question_id":"8497","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih\r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who replied as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <p>If this is a two-way exchange of gifts, then there is nothing wrong\r\n    with it.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"8498","question_id":"8498","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>That \r\n          is not haraam, but it is better not to take it.

Hence the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n      be upon him) did not recommend or encourage his ummah to do this, and did\r\n      not command or hint to them to do this. Nothing to this effect has been\r\n      transmitted from any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). If\r\n      it was a good thing, they would have done it before us.

The maintenance that the father spends on his children varies \r\n    according to their needs. What is spent on a small child is not the same as \r\n    what is spent on an older child, and the expenses of a child who is studying \r\n    at the elementary stages is not like the expenses of a child who is studying \r\n    at the University. The expenses of a daughter are not usually like the \r\n    expenses of a son.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This includes the expenses of marriage. If a father spends on \r\n    the marriage of one of his sons, he is not obliged to give something similar \r\n    to those who are not married, because this comes under the heading of \r\n    expenses which are given only to the one who needs it. When another one \r\n    grows up he will arrange his marriage too, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This may also be said to regard to accommodation. If the \r\n    father has a house or apartment, and the married son needs it, the father \r\n    may give it to him for him to make use of it, not to own it, and thus he \r\n    meets his need. The same applies if he needs a car for example; he may give \r\n    it to him to drive it but not to take possession of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that he may give each son what he needs and what \r\n    is appropriate for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for gifts which are additional to maintenance, this is \r\n    where equality and fairness is required and it is haraam to prefer one son \r\n    over the others. Sons should be given equal gifts, and each male is given a \r\n    share of two females. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    pointing out the difference between maintenance and giving:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    if we assume that one of them is at school and needs expenses \r\n    for school such as books, exercise books, pens, ink and the like, and the \r\n    other one does not need that, and he is older than him but he does not need \r\n    those things, if he gives something to the first one does he have to give \r\n    something similar to the second?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that he does not have to do that, because being \r\n    fair in spending on maintenance means giving each one what he needs. An \r\n    example of that is if a son needs a ghutrah and cap which costs 100 riyals, \r\n    and the female needs earrings which cost 1000 riyals. What is fair?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that what is fair is to buy the headgear for \r\n    the boy for 100 riyals, and to buy earrings for the girl for 1000 riyals, \r\n    which is 10 times more than what the boy gets. This is fair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example: if one of them needs to get married and the \r\n    other does not, what is fair?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that he should give the one who needs to get \r\n    married and not to the other. It is to be regarded as a mistake when some \r\n    people arrange marriages for their sons who have reached the age of \r\n    marriage, and they have younger sons, so they write in their wills that the \r\n    sons who are not yet married are to have marriages arranged for them with \r\n    the costs covered from one third of the will [which it is permitted to \r\n    bequeath]. This is not permissible, because marriage comes under the heading \r\n    of meeting needs, and these children have not reached the age of marriage, \r\n    so making this will in their favour is haraam and should not be executed, \r\n    because even the heirs are not permitted to execute the will except if they \r\n    are of the age of maturity and give their consent, in which case each heir \r\n    may decide to carry out these wishes with regard to his own share. End quote \r\n    from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (4\/599).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the obligation of treating children equally in \r\n    giving, please see the answer to question number\r\n    [fatin]22169[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On the basis of the above, if a person has a son who is \r\n    married and needs accommodation, there is nothing wrong with giving him \r\n    permission to live in one of the apartments, whilst retaining ownership of \r\n    it, and he does not have to give anything to his brothers or sisters. \r\n    Similarly, you do not have to give them anything, so long as they are not in \r\n    need of accommodation, either because they are living with you and under \r\n    your care, or because the daughter is living with her husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the son does not need accommodation, then letting him live \r\n    in the apartment for free comes under the heading of giving, in which case \r\n    you have to pay attention to fairness, by giving the rest of his siblings \r\n    something equivalent to the rent of the apartment, or by making the son pay \r\n    rent which should go to you, or giving all of his siblings their share of \r\n    the rent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you want to give your children ownership of the \r\n    apartments, then you have to treat them fairly and give each male twice the \r\n    share of each female, as in the case of inheritance. It is wrong to give the \r\n    apartment to the son, for example, and then tell him: Give to your brothers \r\n    and sisters, or to put it in the ownership of the males and tell them to \r\n    give to the females, because they may or may not give to them. The fact that \r\n    the son needs the accommodation -- if he indeed needs it &ndash; can be met by \r\n    letting him live there, without giving him possession. If the father wants \r\n    to give him possession, then he must treat them all fairly, and it must be \r\n    documented properly in order to prevent disputes and differences between the \r\n    children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which \r\n    pleases Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8515","question_id":"8515","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible to give the representative any money or \r\n    gifts, because that comes under the heading of bribery and haraam gifts to \r\n    workers.

It is not \r\n    permissible to accept this from anyone, because it must be returned to its \r\n    owner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (The second type is) that which is haraam because of the way \r\n    in which it has been acquired, such as money that is taken by means of \r\n    dealing in riba or doing haraam actions, such as bribes, cheating and \r\n    payments for singing and dancing. That also includes what you have mentioned \r\n    of working as a sound engineer for haraam movies and soap operas. This \r\n    wealth which is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired is haraam \r\n    only for the one who acquires it. As for the one who takes it from him by \r\n    permissible means, there is nothing wrong with that, although it is better \r\n    to refrain from taking it and to err on the side of caution and not benefit \r\n    from it, especially if not taking it will affect its original owner and make \r\n    him give up this work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated in a saheeh report from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he was asked about a person \r\n    who had a neighbour who consumed riba and invited him to eat with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said: Accept his invitation, for the pleasure will be \r\n    yours and the burden of sin will be his.

If he does not eat his father's food, is that considered \r\n    disobedience to his father?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: With regard to the man who knows that his \r\n    father's wealth is haraam, if it is haraam in and of itself, in the sense \r\n    that he knows that his father stole this money from someone, then it is not \r\n    permissible to eat it. If you know that your father stole this sheep and \r\n    slaughtered it, then do not eat and do not accept his invitation. But if it \r\n    is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired, such as if he deals \r\n    with riba or cheats and so on, then eat, and the sin is on him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is that the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allaah be upon him and his family) accepted gifts and food from the \r\n    Jews, who are known deal in riba and consume haraam. A Jewish woman gave him \r\n    a poisoned sheep in Khaybar so that he would die, but Allaah protected him \r\n    against that until an appointed time. And a Jewish man invited him to eat \r\n    barley bread and fat, and he accepted his invitation and ate. And he bought \r\n    food for his family from a Jew, and he and his family ate. So let him eat \r\n    and the sin is on his father.

If he gives it without the \r\n    intention of getting rid of it and he gives you the money and you give it to \r\n    your husband, there is nothing wrong with that, as stated above, because you \r\n    have taken it in a permissible manner which is as a gift, and the sin is \r\n    only on the one who acquired it (unlawfully).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is permissible to accept the gift of a kaafir, so as to \r\n    soften his heart towards Islam or to honour him as a relative, neighbour and \r\n    the like.

It is not permissible for the Muslim who is about to meet \r\n    Allah -- as he has reached the age of 80 -- to do this, thus causing \r\n    resentment and grudges among his sons and going against the command of the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: &ldquo;&hellip; Fear Allaah \r\n    and treat your children fairly.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2398) and Muslim \r\n    (3055).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if your \r\n    father did not intend to do such a trick; rather he actually wanted to sell \r\n    his property to any purchaser as your brother claims, because he was in \r\n    urgent need of the money, then he should sell it for the market price, and \r\n    there is nothing wrong with his reducing the price a little for his son, as \r\n    people customarily do such things when involved n similar transactions. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If more than \r\n    one of a man&rsquo;s children wanted to buy his property and all of them wanted to \r\n    buy it for a similar price, then he should cast lots among them, and the one \r\n    whose name is drawn will have the right to buy the house, so as to avoid any \r\n    hint of favouritism towards one of his sons with regard to giving and so \r\n    that all his sons will be free from resentment, grudges, shunning and envy \r\n    towards one another.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the \r\n    father did do wrong and favoured one of his sons, and the others did not \r\n    approve of that, then it is their right to object to that sale and to ask \r\n    him to cancel it.

What matters is the value on the day \r\n    he gives it back, not the day he asked for it, as it says in al-Kharashi and \r\n    elsewhere. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ibn al-&lsquo;Attaar said: Whatever is given of a \r\n    ram or similar gifts at the time of the wedding party, it should be given \r\n    back to the giver if he asks to be rewarded later on, as is customary. It is \r\n    an implicit deal that everyone should do that on the basis that he will be \r\n    given something similar when he has a wedding &hellip;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It may be understood from the phrase &ldquo;when \r\n    he has a wedding&rdquo; that the giver is required to be patient until he has a \r\n    wedding or similar event. And it says something similar in al-Burzuli. \r\n    However, the apparent meaning of the words of at-Tataa&rsquo;i is that he does not \r\n    have to be patient, if that is the custom. He was followed in this view by \r\n    al-Ujhoori and al-Kharashi. The recipient does not have to give a gift of \r\n    more or less the same value unless he receives it in his hand, in which case \r\n    he is obliged to give the value of the gift, based on its value on the day \r\n    he received it. And the giver has the right to take back part of the value \r\n    straight away and he does not have to wait until he has a wedding.

Rather \r\n    it is a kind of reward and help and treating one another fairly. Just as the \r\n    first giver gave you a loan at your time of need, it is only fair that you \r\n    should give him a loan at his time of need, and not only repay his loan. \r\n    This is, in some ways, like a group of employees in which each one lends to \r\n    another on the basis that the other will lend to him when it is his turn to \r\n    have a loan.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said, concerning the verse in which Allah says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And have in his mind no favour from anyone for which a \r\n    reward is expected in return, Except only the desire to seek the Countenance \r\n    of his Lord, the Most High; He surely will be pleased (when he will enter \r\n    Paradise)&rdquo; [al-Layl :19-20]<\/i>: What is meant is: his giving is not limited \r\n    to those who did him favours before, because this is a kind of fair \r\n    treatment that is required of all people when they deal with one another. It \r\n    is like when you exchange items when buying and selling and renting. This is \r\n    required of all people towards all other people; if there is no one whom he \r\n    should reward for having done him a favour (as mentioned in the verse quoted \r\n    above), then his giving is not subject to this equation and his giving is \r\n    purely for the sake of his Lord Most High.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    7\/372.

It \r\n    was not permissible for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) to accept charity, whether it was voluntary or obligatory (i.e., \r\n    zakaah), but he ate from the charity that had been given to Bareerah, \r\n    because Bareerah took it in a lawful manner, then the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) also took it in a permissible manner even though \r\n    if he had taken it in the manner in which Bareerah had taken it, it would \r\n    not have been permissible for him.

He said: &ldquo;Have you given to all of \r\n    them like you have given to this one?&rdquo; He said: No. He said: &ldquo;Then do not \r\n    ask me to bear witness for I will not bear witness to injustice.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: A man must \r\n    be fair in giving gifts to his children, and not single out one of them or \r\n    do anything to indicate that he prefers one of them over another. If he \r\n    singles out one of them for giving, or he shows that he prefer one over \r\n    another, then he is sinning, and he must treat them all fairly by means of \r\n    one of two things, either taking back what he gave to some in exclusion of \r\n    others, or giving to the others. Tawoos said: That is not permissible, not \r\n    even if you show preference to one by giving him a burned loaf of bread \r\n    (that you do not give to the others). This was also the view of Ibn \r\n    al-Mubaarak, and something similar was narrated from Mujaahid, and &lsquo;Urwah. \r\n    End quote from <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (5\/387).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the children are both male and female, then treating them \r\n    fairly means giving each male the share of two females, because this is the \r\n    division that Allah has approved for His slaves in terms of inheritance. \r\n    This is the view of the Hanbalis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    However the majority are of the view that males and females \r\n    should be given equal shares when giving gifts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Once this is \r\n    proven, the fair giving that is recommended is to share among them in \r\n    accordance with the way in which Allah has ordained inheritance to be shared \r\n    out. So each male should be given the share of two females. This is the view \r\n    of &lsquo;Ata&rsquo;, Shurayh, Ishaaq and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan. Shurayh said to a man \r\n    who shared out his wealth among his children: Refer to the division of the \r\n    estate as mentioned in the Book of Allah and share it out accordingly. &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; \r\n    said: They (the salaf) did not share out wealth but in accordance with the \r\n    Book of Allah, may He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i and Ibn al-Mubaarak said: \r\n    The female is to be given the same as the male, because the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Basheer ibn Sa&lsquo;d: &ldquo;Treat \r\n    them fairly (equally)&rdquo; and he explained that by saying: &ldquo;Would you like them \r\n    all to honour you equally?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Then treat them fairly \r\n    (equally).&rdquo; And the daughter is like the son in terms of the duty to honour \r\n    the parents, and the same applies to giving gifts to her. It was narrated \r\n    that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Treat your children fairly (equally) in giving gifts; \r\n    and if I were to have given precedence to anyone, I would have given \r\n    precedence to women over men.&rdquo; Narrated by Sa&lsquo;eed in his <i>Sunan<\/i>. And \r\n    because it is a gift given during one&rsquo;s lifetime, so male and female are to \r\n    be treated equally, as is the case with regard to spending on maintenance \r\n    and clothing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But we say: Allah, may He be exalted, has explained how \r\n    wealth is to be divided among them and He has given the male a share equal \r\n    to that of two females. So it should be divided in accordance with the way \r\n    in which it is to be divided after death, i.e., inheritance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is confirmed by the fact that a gift given to children \r\n    is like hastening to pass on wealth before one&rsquo;s death, and is similar to \r\n    what happens after death. Therefore it should be divided in accordance with \r\n    the way in which it is to be divided after death. This is like when one pays \r\n    zakaah before it becomes due: it is to be paid in the same manner as it \r\n    would be paid after it becomes due. Moreover the male is in greater need of \r\n    wealth than the female because when they get married, the dowry, maintenance \r\n    and maintenance of the children are the responsibility of the male, and the \r\n    female is benefitting from all that; hence giving precedence to the male is \r\n    more appropriate because his need is greater. Allah, may He be exalted, has \r\n    ordained the manner in which the estate is to be divided and He has given \r\n    precedence to the male for the reasons referred to above. The same reason is \r\n    applicable to gifts given during a person&rsquo;s lifetime.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 5\/389&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the father gave more to some than they were entitled to \r\n    during his lifetime, then he died, the children should correct this division \r\n    and establish justice.

He said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I said: \r\n    Then one half? He said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I said: One third? He said: &ldquo;Yes, but one \r\n    third is a lot. If you leave your family well off that is better than \r\n    leaving them asking of people.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (16\/317): It \r\n    is not permissible to bequeath more than one third, and a bequest to an heir \r\n    is not valid unless the other heirs agree, because of the words of the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah has given \r\n    each person who has rights his rights, and there is no bequest for an heir.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, at-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah, and ad-Daaraqutni, \r\n    who added at the end of it: &ldquo;unless the [other] heirs agree.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Many of the scholars regard it as mustahabb or encouraged for \r\n    the one who makes a bequest to bequeath less than one third. It says in <i>\r\n    al-Kaafi fi Fiqh Ibn Hanbal<\/i> (2\/265): Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: I wish that \r\n    people would bequeath less than one third, because the Messenger of Allah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said &ldquo;&hellip; but one third is a lot.&rdquo; \r\n    Agreed upon.

The scholars explained that as involving compulsion using \r\n    the weapon of embarrassment, which is like compulsion using a real weapon. \r\n    In fact many people would accept the real sword and put up with the injuries \r\n    it causes when they would not accept the sword of embarrassment, out of fear \r\n    for their dignity and standing which to which wise people give precedence \r\n    and fear greatly for it.

It says in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> \r\n    (2\/77): Ibraaheem said: First of all comes (the cost of) the shroud, then \r\n    paying of debts, then bequests.

With regard to your estate in particular, the \r\n    inheritance is to be divided among your wife and your siblings, if you die \r\n    before them. Your wife is entitled to one quarter of the estate because you \r\n    have no children to inherit from you.

The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions also mentions that in \r\n    some cases, such as when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) ordered that the vessels and containers of wine be broken; when he \r\n    ordered &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar to burn the two garments that were dyed with \r\n    safflower; and when on the day of Khaybar he ordered that the pots in which \r\n    the flesh of domesticated donkeys had been cooked be broken, then they asked \r\n    him for permission to wash them and he gave them permission. This indicates \r\n    that both things are permissible, because the penalty is not necessarily by \r\n    breaking. Another example is when he demolished the mosque of the \r\n    hypocrites; when he burned the belongings of the one who had stolen from the \r\n    war booty before it had been shared out; when he took half of the wealth of \r\n    the one who had withheld zakaah, on the orders of Allaah; when he ordered \r\n    the one who was wearing a ring of gold to throw it away, and he did so, and \r\n    no one touched it; when he cut down the palm trees of the Jews to annoy \r\n    them; when &lsquo;Umar and &lsquo;Ali burned down places in which alcohol was sold; when \r\n    &lsquo;Umar burned the castle of Sa&rsquo;d ibn Abi Waqqaas when he hid from the people \r\n    he had been put in charge of.&nbsp; These cases are all saheeh and well known, \r\n    and it cannot be claimed that they have been abrogated. The one who says \r\n    that financial penalties have been abrogated and that this is general in \r\n    application has gone beyond the views of the imams in quoting and reaching \r\n    conclusions. Most of these issues are acceptable according to the madhhab of \r\n    Ahmad and others, and many of them are acceptable according to Maalik. The \r\n    fact that the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the senior Sahaabah did these \r\n    things after the death of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) also shows that the claim that the ruling has been abrogated is \r\n    false.

[fatin]82497[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These gifts that are given to workers who sell and distribute \r\n    goods, or who import them and buy them, take several forms, including the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Reducing the price of the product or giving free samples. \r\n    It is not permissible for the worker to benefit from this, rather he must \r\n    give them to the owner of the store, because the worker is acting on his \r\n    behalf in doing business, so any gifts or discounts must be given to the one \r\n    who appointed him, unless he gives him permission to take them for himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Small amounts of money that are given to the worker, \r\n    which are known as tips, and it may be said to him, &ldquo;This is to cover the \r\n    cost of gas&rdquo; etc. The worker has no right to take these tips, and they come \r\n    under the heading of gifts to workers that are not allowed, as they usually \r\n    lead to the worker neglecting his work and that which has been entrusted to \r\n    him, so he does not try to do that which is best for the store, rather he \r\n    buys or sell to those who will give him gifts and tips. Even if we assume \r\n    that the worker does not commit this transgression and neglect the interests \r\n    of the business, he is still not allowed to accept gifts, because Islam pays \r\n    attention to what is usually the case, and it has forbidden this so as to \r\n    ward off the means that may lead to haraam things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee was asked: An agent works for a \r\n    company and has a regular salary from this company.

The hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) has nothing to do with this matter, because \r\n    it has to do with one who is given something from the bayt al-maal of the \r\n    Muslims by the one who is in charge of the Muslims, without him asking for \r\n    it or hoping for it.

Those who are in \r\n    charge of them should choose the most qualified and the best suited, without \r\n    any favouritism or bribes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A person may \r\n    ask someone to intercede for him with regard to getting one of these jobs, \r\n    so long as he is qualified for it and that will not result in the \r\n    transgression of the rights of others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (25\/389):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the \r\n    intercession of someone who can help him to get a job will result in one who \r\n    is more qualified and has more right to it, due to greater knowledge of the \r\n    field and more ability to do the job correctly, being deprived of the job, \r\n    then such intercession is haraam, because it is wronging one who is more \r\n    deserving of the job, and it is wronging the bosses too, by depriving them \r\n    of the work of one who is more qualified and of his services and help. It is \r\n    also a transgression against the ummah because it deprives them of one who \r\n    can take care of this aspect of their affairs in the best manner. In \r\n    addition to that it generates resentment and suspicion and corrupts society. \r\n    But if this intercession will not result in any violation of people&rsquo;s \r\n    rights, then it is permissible and even encouraged in sharee&rsquo;ah, and the \r\n    intercessor will be rewarded for it, in sha Allaah. It is proven that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Intercede, \r\n    and you will be rewarded, and Allaah will decree what He wills through the \r\n    lips of His Messenger.&rdquo;<span> &nbsp;<\/span> \r\n    Al-Bukhaari (1342). End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to giving money to this intercessor, this is subject to further discussion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; If this \r\n    intercessor is the one who is responsible for selection of employees, or he \r\n    can exercise his influence and authority in that, then giving money to him \r\n    is a bribe and is haraam. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who gives a bribe and the one who \r\n    takes it, and the one who mediates between them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari \r\n    (6636) and Muslim( 1832) narrated from Abu Humayd al-Saa&rsquo;idi that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    appointed an agent (to collect the zakaah). The agent came when he had \r\n    finished his work and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, this is for you, and \r\n    this was given to me.&rdquo; He said to him: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit in the house of \r\n    your father and mother and see whether you are given anything or not?&rdquo; Then \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    stood up that evening after the prayer and bore witness and praised Allaah \r\n    as He deserves to be praised, then he said: &ldquo;What is the matter with an \r\n    agent whom we appoint, and he comes to us and says, &lsquo;This is for you and \r\n    this was given to me&rsquo;? Why doesn&rsquo;t he sit in the house of his father and \r\n    mother and see if he is given anything or not? &hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; If you \r\n    are qualified for this job, and paying the bribe will not result in the \r\n    transgression of anyone&rsquo;s rights, or depriving anyone who is your equal or \r\n    more qualified than you, and you will be deprived of your rights if you do \r\n    not pay this bribe, then it is permissible for you to pay it in this case, \r\n    in order to attain your rights, although it is haraam for the one who takes \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This applies \r\n    whether the money is given to the one who is in charge of that or to someone \r\n    else who takes the money in return for interceding on your behalf with the \r\n    one who is in charge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Hazm \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Muhalla<\/i> (8\/118): Bribes are \r\n    not permitted , i.e., that which a person gives so that he will judge \r\n    falsely in his favour, or appoint him to a position of authority, or wrong \r\n    someone for him. This is a sin on the part of the one who gives it and the \r\n    one who takes it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for one \r\n    who is deprived of his rights and gives a bribe so as to ward off wrong from \r\n    himself, this is permissible for the one who gives it but the one who takes \r\n    it is sinning. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If he gives him a \r\n    gift so that he will refrain from wronging him or will give him his due \r\n    rights, this gift is haraam for the one who takes it but it is permissible \r\n    for the giver to give it, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;I give one of them a gift and he goes out with it \r\n    carrying it like fire under his armpit.&rdquo; It was said: &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, why do you give to them?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;They insist on asking me and \r\n    Allaah insists that I should not be miserly.&rdquo; For example, giving to one who \r\n    hid some news, or wronged people. Giving to these people is permissible for \r\n    the giver but it is haraam for them to take it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for \r\n    giving gifts with regard to intercession, such as when a man intercedes with \r\n    the one who is in authority to relieve him of some wrong, or to give him his \r\n    right, or to appoint him to a position of authority that he deserves, or to \r\n    enlist him in a fighting force for which he is qualified, or to give him \r\n    some of the money that is endowed in a waqf for the poor, Qur&rsquo;aan readers, \r\n    pilgrims and others, and he is one of those who are entitled to it, and \r\n    other kinds of intercession that have to do with helping people to do \r\n    obligatory duties or avoiding haraam things, in these cases too it is haraam \r\n    to accept the gift, but it is permissible for the giver to give whatever \r\n    will help him to attain his rights or ward off wrongdoing from himself. This \r\n    is what is narrated from the salaf and the senior imams.

As that is the aim of \r\n    the state law, all the rulings lead to making this binding will like a fixed \r\n    share of the estate, thus becoming binding with no reason to make it \r\n    binding, hence it is executed automatically every time, and thus it becomes \r\n    confused with the division of the estate as prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah.

This was stated by &lsquo;Ali and Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with them), but the scholars differed as to its \r\n    amount. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured the view that \r\n    what is meant is a large amount of wealth such that there is something left \r\n    over after the heirs are made independent of means, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave a reason for not allowing a \r\n    bequest of more than one-third (of one&rsquo;s wealth), when he said: &ldquo;If you \r\n    leave your heirs independent of means, that is better for them than leaving \r\n    them dependent and asking from people.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1296) and \r\n    Muslim (1628).

But the \r\n    state law ignores this condition, and gives them a share of the estate \r\n    whether the deceased left behind a large amount of wealth or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The word of Allaah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-aqrabeen (translated here as &ldquo;<i>and next of kin<\/i>&rdquo;) is general in \r\n    meaning and includes all relatives, so it includes grandchildren as well as \r\n    siblings and their children, paternal uncles and maternal uncles and their \r\n    children, and other relatives.

Rather it gives them this share even if they are \r\n    well off, but it should have limited it to cases of need.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad Abu Zahrah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said (p. 244): In fact if we accept this obligation (binding will), we must \r\n    take into account whether people are in need, because wills or bequests come \r\n    under the same heading as charity, so it must be given to the poor. And \r\n    because the binding will takes precedence over anything else, the definition \r\n    of next-of-kin should be broader. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; The state law restricts the relatives who are entitled to \r\n    this bequest and binding will to the grandchildren only, and gives them \r\n    their father&rsquo;s share. It may be understood from the law that this is the \r\n    view of Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him), but this is not his view. \r\n    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) did not single out the grandchildren \r\n    for this bequest, rather it should be for all the relatives apart from the \r\n    heirs, and the person should have bequeathed something to at least three of \r\n    his relatives, because this is the minimum plural. Moreover, Ibn Hazm did \r\n    not set a specific amount for the portion of the wealth that is bequeathed, \r\n    rather it may be whatever the deceased wished. If he did not bequeath \r\n    anything then the heirs are the ones who should determine the amount of \r\n    wealth they want to give to the relatives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person \r\n    dies without leaving a will, then charity must be given from it of whatever \r\n    amount is possible, and that is a must, because bequeathing something is \r\n    obligatory, as we have narrated, therefore it is obligatory to give away \r\n    something of his wealth after his death. And because the deceased no longer \r\n    has any control over his wealth, the heirs should give away some of the \r\n    wealth, and there is no limit to that except what the heirs or executor of \r\n    the will see fit, without being unfair to the heirs. It is obligatory for \r\n    every Muslim to bequeath something to those of his relatives who do not \r\n    inherit, either because they are slaves or kaafirs, or because there is \r\n    someone who prevents them from inheriting, or because they will not inherit, \r\n    then he may bequeath whatever he wants to them, and there is no limit to \r\n    that. But if he does not do that, they should be given what the heirs or \r\n    executor of the will see fit.

For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The grandchildren may be well off and their paternal uncles \r\n    (the sons of the deceased) may be poor, but in this case too the law would \r\n    give the grandchildren a share of the inheritance in the name of the binding \r\n    will, even though their paternal uncles are more entitled to this money than \r\n    they are, because they are closer to the deceased than them, and are in need \r\n    of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why does the state law care about the grandchildren and not \r\n    about the grandfathers and grandmothers who do not inherit, even though in \r\n    most cases they are in greater need and may be sick and unable to work, and \r\n    in need of medical treatment and maintenance?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Why does the law give something to the daughter&rsquo;s daughter, \r\n    and not to the father&rsquo;s mother, for example?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The daughter&rsquo;s daughter may take more than the son&rsquo;s daughter \r\n    takes. If someone dies and leaves behind a daughter and a daughter of a \r\n    daughter who is deceased, and a daughter of a son, and he leaves behind 30 \r\n    feddans for example, then according to the binding will, the daughter&rsquo;s \r\n    daughter in this case gets one third of the estate or 10 feddans, which \r\n    would have been her mother&rsquo;s share if she was alive.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the daughter and son&rsquo;s daughter get the rest at a ratio \r\n    of 1:3, so the son&rsquo;s daughter gets five feddans, or half of what the \r\n    daughter&rsquo;s daughter gets!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even though the son&rsquo;s daughter is more entitled to it. Hence \r\n    the scholars were unanimously agreed that the son&rsquo;s daughter should inherit, \r\n    and that the daughter&rsquo;s daughter does not inherit, so how can a non-heir be \r\n    given more than an heir, even though their relationship (to the deceased) is \r\n    of the same degree?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (d)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The son&rsquo;s daughter may take more than the daughter, because \r\n    if a person dies and leaves behind two daughters, the daughter of a deceased \r\n    son, and a sister, and he leaves behind 18 feddans for example, the amount \r\n    that the son&rsquo;s daughter gets is one-third of the estate, which is 6 feddans, \r\n    and the rest is divided among the two daughters and the sister, with the two \r\n    daughters getting two-thirds, or 8 feddans, four each, and the sister \r\n    getting the remainder, which is four feddans! &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This irregularity and contradiction points to human \r\n    imperfection and confirms the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely, have \r\n    found therein many a contradiction&rdquo; [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:82]<\/i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The strongest objection to this state law is that it has in \r\n    fact become a kind of inheritance, hence the grandchildren take this share \r\n    even if the deceased did not bequeath anything to them, and they take it \r\n    regardless of whether he left a lot of money or a little, whether they are \r\n    poor or well off. All of this indicates that it has become like an \r\n    inheritance, and this is a rejection and change of the ruling of Allaah, may \r\n    He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for cases where they claim that they have introduced this \r\n    law as a remedy for poverty of the grandchildren, that may be solved in ways \r\n    that do not conflict with sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best way is by teaching the rich that it is obligatory or \r\n    at least mustahabb for them to bequeath some of their wealth to their poor \r\n    relatives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second way, if he does not bequeath anything, is for the \r\n    heirs, if they are well off, to give the grandchildren or other poor \r\n    relatives some of this wealth, which will be an act of&nbsp; charity and \r\n    upholding ties of kinship on their part.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    By means of these two methods, this problem may be solved \r\n    without going against sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to taking money by means of this binding will and \r\n    bequest, it is haraam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

What some people do, if they get one \r\n    of their sons married off, is to bequeath money to the rest of them, \r\n    thinking that this is fair, and something like this is what has happened in \r\n    the case of the woman asked about here; she wanted to deprive her son of his \r\n    share of the estate, thinking that this was fair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    It is not permissible for a person to favour some of his children over \r\n    others except between male and female; he can give the male double what he \r\n    gives to the female, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.&rdquo; So if someone \r\n    gives one of his sons one hundred dirhams, he should give the others one \r\n    hundred dirhams each, and he should give the daughters fifty dirhams, or \r\n    take back the money that he gave to the first son. What we have mentioned \r\n    here does not apply to obligatory maintenance; when it comes to obligatory \r\n    maintenance he should give each of them what he needs. If it so happens that \r\n    one of his sons needs to get married, he should get him married and give him \r\n    the mahr if the son cannot pay the mahr, and in this case he does not have \r\n    to give the others the same as he gave to this one who needed to get married \r\n    and he paid for the mahr, because getting sons married is part of \r\n    maintenance. I would also like to point out something that some people do \r\n    out of ignorance: when a man has sons who have reached the age of marriage, \r\n    he gets them married, and if he has other sons who are still young, he \r\n    leaves a bequest in his will giving them something like what he spent to get \r\n    the adult sons married. This is haraam and is not permissible, because this \r\n    is a bequest to an heir, and making a bequest to an heir is haraam. The \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah has given \r\n    each one who has rights his rights, and there is no bequest to an heir.&rdquo; So \r\n    if he says: I am bequeathing this money to them because I got their brothers \r\n    married with a similar amount, we say: if the younger ones reach the age of \r\n    marriage before you die, then get them married as you got their brothers \r\n    married, but if they do not reach that age (before you die), you are not \r\n    obliged to get them married.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, 3\/30&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: it is not permissible for a person to bequeath to \r\n    the rest of his sons money for them to get married, or to deprive those whom \r\n    he previously got married of all or part of their inheritance, because that \r\n    is transgressing the limits set by Allah, may He be exalted, and is causing \r\n    harm by means of one&rsquo;s bequest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What must be done is to divide the estate among all the \r\n    heirs, each one taking the share allocated to him by sharee&lsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the request of some of the heirs for the \r\n    estate to be divided, this is their right and you should respond to that.

Some scholars regarded such a will as binding or \r\n    obligatory, others regarded it as mustahabb.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of \r\n    you, if he leaves wealth, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of \r\n    kin, according to reasonable manners.

The scholars differed as to whether this is \r\n    abrogated by the verses on inheritance or is it is general and the verses on \r\n    inheritance are specific? There are two views. The majority of scholars are \r\n    of the view that it is abrogated, but the more correct view is that it is \r\n    not abrogated, because it is possible to understand it as speaking in \r\n    specific terms and say that the words &ldquo;<i>to parents and next of kin<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    apply if they are heirs, i.e., if they are heirs then no bequest can be made \r\n    to them, and the shares of inheritance decreed by Allaah are sufficient. So \r\n    the general meaning of the verse still applies to those who are not heirs.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Another lesson we learn \r\n    is that it is permissible for a person to bequeath whatever he wants of his \r\n    wealth, but this restricted by the hadeeth of Sa&rsquo;d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) who said to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Shall I give two-thirds of my wealth in \r\n    charity?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Then one half?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said: \r\n    &ldquo;Then one third?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;One third, and one-third is too much.&rdquo; Agreed \r\n    upon. Based on this, the bequest should not amount to more than one third of \r\n    the wealth, so the meaning of the verse is restricted by the hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The obligatory bequest is \r\n    that which is left by one who has left behind a great deal of wealth, \r\n    because Allaah says: &ldquo;<i>if he leaves wealth<\/i>&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:190]. As for \r\n    the one who leaves only a little wealth behind, it is better for him not to \r\n    make any bequest if he has heirs, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Sa&rsquo;d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him: &ldquo;For you to leave your heirs independent of means is \r\n    better than leaving them dependent and holding out their hands to people.&rdquo; \r\n    Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Tafseer Soorat \r\n    al-Baqarah<\/i>, 2\/306, 307&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; If their uncles give \r\n    them some of their shares and distribute that among them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Calculating what would \r\n    have been their father&rsquo;s share and giving it to them when he is no longer \r\n    alive is something for which there is no known basis in sharee'ah. In some \r\n    states this is called the &ldquo;binding bequest&rdquo; and they give the children of \r\n    the son who died during the lifetime of his father &ndash; i.e., their grandfather \r\n    &ndash; the share that would have been their father&rsquo;s, so long as it does not \r\n    exceed one-third of the estate, and they give the children of a daughter the \r\n    share that would have been their mother&rsquo;s, so long as it does not exceed \r\n    one-third, even if the grandfather did not bequeath anything to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is contrary to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah and does not have to be obeyed, because it is an attempt to share \r\n    the role of Lawgiver with Allaah and a transgression against the rights of \r\n    the heirs. They attributed this idea to Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him), but it is a fabrication against him, because Ibn Hazm regarded it as \r\n    obligatory to make bequests to relatives who do not inherit, which include \r\n    the paternal uncle, maternal uncle and all other relatives, but they do not \r\n    allocate a share of the estate to these relatives. Moreover, Ibn Hazm did \r\n    not stipulate a specific amount or share, but they are doing that by giving \r\n    the share of the father or mother. And Ibn Hazm said that they should be \r\n    given something in cases where the grandfather has made a bequest, whereas \r\n    they give these grandchildren a share even if the grandfather did not make \r\n    any bequest. So what Ibn Hazm said is different from what they attributed to \r\n    him. Judges should not issue such rulings, and they should realize that by \r\n    issuing such rulings they are going against the law of Allaah, may He be \r\n    exalted, and taking wealth from those to whom Allaah has given a right to \r\n    it, and giving it to those who are not entitled to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is going against the \r\n    ruling and laws of Allaah. Many scholars of al-Azhar have objected to the \r\n    &ldquo;obligatory bequest law&rdquo; and issued fatwas speaking against it.

If the \r\n    answer is no, then why?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Grandchildren refers to \r\n    the sons of the son, not the sons of the daughter. If their father dies \r\n    before his own father, they do not inherit from their grandfather if he has \r\n    a son or sons of his own, because a son is a closer than a son&rsquo;s son. If the \r\n    grandfather does not have any other son but he has daughters, then the \r\n    grandchildren inherit whatever is left after the daughters have been given \r\n    their inheritance. Similarly, they inherit from their grandfather if he does \r\n    not have any sons or daughters, so they take the place of his children, and \r\n    each male is given the share of two females.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Majallat al-Haras \r\n    al-Watani, issue no. 264, dated 1\/6\/2004&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8583","question_id":"8583","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If a man \r\n    dies and he has a father who is still living and male children, or male and \r\n    female children, then the father gets one-sixth of the estate, the wife gets \r\n    one-eighth if he has a wife, then the rest is given to the children, with \r\n    each male getting the share of two females.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if the \r\n    children are females only, one daughter or more, then the wife takes \r\n    one-eighth, if there is a wife then the daughter or daughters take what \r\n    Allaah has allocated to them: half for one daughter, and two-thirds for two \r\n    or more daughters.

In this case, the father gets \r\n    one-sixth, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;a sixth \r\n    share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; \r\n    4:11]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The father \r\n    gets one-sixth if there is a daughter, according to scholarly consensus, \r\n    then he takes whatever is left by virtue of kinship on the male side, \r\n    because of the report narrated by Ibn Abbaas who said: The Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Give the \r\n    shares of inheritance to those who are entitled to them, and whatever is \r\n    left is for the closest male relatives.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The father \r\n    is the closest male relative after a son and grandson, and the scholars are \r\n    agreed upon all of this.

This in itself should be considered the beginning of a proper \r\n    solution. As for the answer to this question, it may be answered in the \r\n    following points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The money which your father had saved for you and gone to \r\n    great lengths for your benefit, is the due of everyone whom Allaah has \r\n    decreed has a share of inheritance. Each of you has a share allotted by \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah after the death of your father; none of you have the right to keep \r\n    this money for himself and deny it to the rest of the heirs, because by \r\n    doing so he is transgressing upon the rights of others. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah likes not \r\n    the transgressors&rdquo;[al-Baqarah 2:190]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated by Abu Harrah al-Raqaashi that his paternal \r\n    uncle said: &ldquo;I was holding on to the reins of the she-camel of Messenger of \r\n    Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s wealth is \r\n    not permissible except with his consent.&rdquo; (Narrated by Ahmad, 20172; classed \r\n    as saheeh al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Irwaa&rsquo;<\/i>, 1761).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On this basis, what your brother did by taking this money is \r\n    considered to be a haraam action, especially since he took the money when \r\n    your father was still alive and he is not entitled to any of the money until \r\n    after his father died. Indeed, after his father&rsquo;s death he is not entitled \r\n    to anything more than the share which Allaah has allocated to him in the \r\n    laws of inheritance. So what your brother must do is to repent to Allaah and \r\n    restore the rights of people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The will which your father wrote was not acceptable according \r\n    to sharee&rsquo;ah, and it is not permissible for you to demand that it be \r\n    executed, because a person who is designated as an heir according to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah cannot be given something in the will (<i>wasiyyah<\/i>). The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah has \r\n    given each person his rights and no will can be made in favour of an heir.&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2120; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Tirmidhi<\/i>, 1722), So it is not permissible for you to demand it, even \r\n    if your brother has taken your money. But you may demand what Allaah has \r\n    granted you in the laws of inheritance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should continue to advise and guide them and try to bring \r\n    them together as much as you can. Remember that you will be rewarded by \r\n    Allaah for that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;There is no good in most of their \r\n    secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allaah&rsquo;s Cause), \r\n    or Ma&lsquo;roof (Islamic Monotheism and all the\r\n    <span>good and righteous deeds which Allaah \r\n    has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, \r\n    seeking the good Pleasure of Allaah, We shall give him a great reward<\/span>&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:114]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Keep telling your sisters not to demand more than they are \r\n    entitled to, and that demanding one-third is something that is not \r\n    permitted. Try also to convince your brother, in a good way, to give your \r\n    sisters that which is rightfully theirs, and to show mercy to his sisters \r\n    after his father&rsquo;s death instead of being a torment to them. You will \r\n    undoubtedly face problems in doing that, but be patient. We ask Allaah to \r\n    make you steadfast.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Fourthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;If you are doing the right thing, it will not matter if \r\n    people blame you or accuse you of being biased.

The two sons takes the rest of the estate, shared equally between \r\n    them. It is not permissible for you to bequeath anything to any of these \r\n    people in addition to his or her legal share, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah has given each \r\n    person who is entitled his rightful share, so there is no bequest to an \r\n    heir.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2046; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the sister, she is prevented from inheriting \r\n    by the presence of the two sons and the father, so she does not inherit.

It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar said: I \r\n    heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. \r\n    The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.

The great scholar al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said in <i>Adwaa&rsquo; al-Bayaan<\/i>: &ldquo;because the one who in \r\n    charge of another and spending money on him will always have his money \r\n    decreasing, and the one who is being looked after and on whom the money is \r\n    spent is expected to have more. The wisdom of giving precedence to the one \r\n    on whose money more demands are made over the one whose money is expected to \r\n    increase is to make up for the expenses of the former. This is sound \r\n    reasoning.&rdquo; (1\/308).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It should be noted that \r\n    Islam preceded all the customs and laws in honouring women and treating them \r\n    fairly, and allowing them financial independence, whereas European women \r\n    were, until recently, denied the authority to own anything!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to what is \r\n    mentioned in the question about a woman who spends on the household or \r\n    contributes to the household expenses, the answer is that women are not \r\n    required to do that, and they can refuse to work or refuse to spend their \r\n    money that they have earned themselves, and ask their husband to spend on \r\n    them and provide accommodation for them and their children. If the husband \r\n    refuses to fulfil this right, then she may ask for a divorce. But if she \r\n    agrees to spend on him and share the household expenses, then this is a good \r\n    deed on her part for which she will be rewarded. But it is not obligatory \r\n    for her to do that, and it has no effect on her share of inheritance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It should also be pointed \r\n    out that this wife may take half the estate of her father or mother, if she \r\n    has no brothers, or she may inherit from her brother or sister, in addition \r\n    to whatever she is entitled to from her husband&rsquo;s estate after he dies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And her husband may be in \r\n    the opposite situation, I mean that he may inherit a small amount from the \r\n    estate of his father, mother or brothers, or he may not inherit anything.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The point is that the \r\n    words &ldquo;<i>to the male, a portion equal to that of two females<\/i>&rdquo; have to \r\n    do with males and females among the children of the deceased; they do not \r\n    apply to the husband and wife, as each of them have independent sources from \r\n    which they may inherit.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"8609","question_id":"8609","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah, and peace and blessings be upon the\r\n    one after whom there is no Prophet.<\/p>\r\n    <p>A Muslim cannot inherit from a kaafir, and a kaafir cannot inherit from a\r\n    Muslim, because of the hadeeth reported in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i>, in which the Prophet\r\n<img>\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The Muslim does not inherit from\r\n    the kaafir, and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.&rdquo; [This applies] even if\r\n    the money were to be used for the purpose of sadaqah, because of the general applicability\r\n    of the hadeeth, and because the Muslim is not commanded to do something haraam in order to\r\n    achieve something prescribed by Islam.

The evidence \r\n          for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><i>&ldquo;&hellip; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the \r\n          mother has a sixth&hellip;&rdquo; <\/i><i>[al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:11]<\/i>&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>where the father is not mentioned. The ruling \r\n          here refers to when the mother is on her own with siblings; after the \r\n          mother is given one-sixth, the rest is to be given to them. Among the \r\n          contemporary Hanbalis, this view was favoured by Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan \r\n          ibn Naasir al-Sa&rsquo;di, when he said: &ldquo;The correct view is that the brothers \r\n          who are prevented from inheriting or whose share is reduced do not prevent \r\n          the mother from inheriting one-third, because Allaah says (interpretation \r\n          of the meaning): <i>&lsquo;&hellip;if the deceased left brothers or (sisters)&hellip;&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n          meaning heirs. As these brothers who are inheriting are not described \r\n          as being prevented from inheriting, so none of them can be prevented, \r\n          because the ruling on the division of inheritance is that the one who \r\n          does not inherit cannot prevent another from inheriting whether in whole \r\n          or in part. The reason for reducing the share of the mother is so that \r\n          they can have a share, but if they are not heirs they cannot prevent \r\n          anyone else from inheriting.&nbsp; And Allaah knows best.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>See <i>al-Tahqeeqaat al-Maradiyyah<\/i> by \r\n          al-Fawzaan, p. 87-88&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have \r\n          mercy on him) said:&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>Siblings cannot reduce the mother&rsquo;s share \r\n          from one-third to one-sixth except if they are heirs, whose share is \r\n          not prevented by the presence of the father. In the case where there \r\n          are two parents or two brothers, the mother&rsquo;s share is one third. The \r\n          presence of the grandfather prevents the brothers from inheriting, thus \r\n          the brothers could not reduce the share of the mother because they themselves \r\n          are prevented from inheriting, according to scholarly consensus.

In the case asked about here, if it becomes clear to \r\n    us that one of the spouses died after the other, even by a short moment, \r\n    then the one who died later inherits from the first one, then the \r\n    inheritance passes to his or her heirs after that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if we do not know which of the two spouses died first, \r\n    then the majority of scholars are of the view that it cannot be proven that \r\n    they inherit from one another, so neither of them inherits from the other, \r\n    because one of the conditions of inheritance is that we should establish \r\n    that the heir was still alive after the death of the deceased, and this \r\n    condition is not met in this case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the husband&rsquo;s estate should be divided among his heirs, \r\n    and his wife does not inherit anything from him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the wife&rsquo;s estate should be divided among her heirs, and \r\n    her husband does not inherit anything from her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    concerning the ruling on a situation where a group of people who would \r\n    inherit from one another died in an accident.

And if you do not make a bequest, there \r\n    is no sin on you; if you make a bequest to some of them and not others, \r\n    there is no sin on you either.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to honour your father and mother and treat them \r\n    kindly, and uphold ties with all of your siblings, males and females, full \r\n    siblings and otherwise, because that is what Allah has enjoined upon you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8674","question_id":"8674","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The mother&rsquo;s share of the estate is \r\n    one-eighth. The rest is to be divided among the sons and daughters, with \r\n    each male getting the share of two females. If we realise that the nisaab \r\n    (minimum threshold) for zakaah is the value of 595 grams of silver, then the \r\n    share of each member of the family reaches the nisaab by itself, so each one \r\n    should pay zakaah &ndash; one quarter of one tenth &ndash; himself, after one full \r\n    (hijri) year has passed; he should pay it himself if he does not have any \r\n    other wealth or he should add it to whatever of that wealth he owns.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same should be done every year; the \r\n    share of each individual should be examined. Any individual whose share \r\n    reaches the nisaab, of gold or silver, must pay zakaah on it.

If the business has to do with trade goods and dealing in \r\n    electrical or electronic goods and equipment that are sold to people, zakaah \r\n    must be paid on the business at a rate of one quarter of one tenth. That \r\n    should be based on the market value at the end of the year; zakaah must be \r\n    paid based on that value. If the business is a commercial venture in which \r\n    no goods are sold, such as if it involves vehicles for hire, apartments or \r\n    other real estate for rent, or production tools, then no zakaah is due on it \r\n    in the first place; rather zakaah must be paid on income generated, if it \r\n    reaches the zakaah, when one full (hijri) year has passed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See the answers to question no. \r\n    [fatin]74987[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]69912[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We would like to draw your attention to \r\n    something that may have been a mistake in your getting involved in this \r\n    business, because you said in your question that the income is fixed &ndash; 215 \r\n    dinars.

So the one whose share is one eighth, for example, may take one \r\n    eighth of the sale price, and so on for the rest of the heirs.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In fact this is what we advise you to do, to \r\n    divide the estate and give each person his or her share. The one who works \r\n    in that profession is more entitled to the shop than anyone else, so she \r\n    should give each of the heirs his share, and you should be easy going with \r\n    regard to that.

Whoever destroys the property of \r\n          another person which was sacred (i.e., protected by sharee&rsquo;ah), and \r\n          destroys it without the owner&rsquo;s permission, is obliged to replace it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Imaam \r\n          al-Muwaffaq said: &ldquo;We do not know of any dispute concerning this matter. \r\n          It is the same regardless of whether that was done deliberately or by \r\n          mistake, and whether (the person who destroyed it) was told by someone \r\n          else to do it or not. The same applies if he causes it to be destroyed, \r\n          such as if he opens a door and causes something which was locked up \r\n          to be lost, or he tilts a vessel and allows what is inside it to flow \r\n          out and be lost &ndash; he is obliged to replace it. The same applies if he \r\n          loosens the reins of an animal or ties it up, and it gets lost or dies \r\n          &ndash; he has to replace it. The same applies if he ties up an animal in \r\n          a narrow street, resulting in a person stumbling over it and dying or \r\n          being injured as a result &ndash; he is responsible for that because he transgressed \r\n          the limits by tying it up in a narrow street. The same applies if he \r\n          stops his car in the street resulting in another car or a person hitting \r\n          it, causing harm &ndash; he is responsible because of the report narrated \r\n          by al-Daaraqutni and others, which says that whoever makes an animal \r\n          stop in the way of the Muslims or in one of their marketplaces, and \r\n          it steps with its front or back leg on something&nbsp; &ndash; he is responsible. \r\n          The same applies if he leaves a pile of mud or some wood or rocks in \r\n          the street, or he digs a hole and that results in a passer-by being \r\n          killed or injured, or he throws a melon rind or similar thing into the \r\n          street, or spills water and someone else slips on it and is killed or \r\n          injured, the one who did that in all cases is responsible, because by \r\n          doing that he was transgressing.&nbsp; How lightly these matters are \r\n          taken nowadays. How often holes are dug in the streets and the way is \r\n          blocked, and they put obstacles in the roads, and how much harm and \r\n          damage results from these actions, without anyone watching over such \r\n          matters and putting them right, to the extent that a person may take \r\n          over the entire road and use it for his own purposes, annoying and causing \r\n          harm to passers-by, and not caring at all that he may be sinning by \r\n          doing that. Another of the cases in which a person is held to be responsible \r\n          is if he keeps a vicious dog and it attacks a passer-by or kills someone \r\n          &ndash; he is held to be responsible because by keeping this dog he was transgressing.&nbsp; \r\n          If he digs a well in his courtyard for his own purposes he is held to \r\n          be responsible for any harm that this may cause, because he is obliged \r\n          to maintain it in a manner that does not harm passers-by. If he leaves \r\n          it without taking proper care of it, then he is transgressing. If he \r\n          has livestock he has to take proper care of them at night to prevent \r\n          them from damaging people&rsquo;s crops; if he leaves them and they do damage \r\n          someone&rsquo;s crops, he is held to be responsible for that, because the \r\n          Prophet&nbsp; \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) decreed that people who \r\n          have property must take care of it during the day, and whatever is damaged \r\n          at night, they must be compensated for that.&rdquo; (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu \r\n          Dawood and Ibn Maajah). So the owner of an animal is not held to be \r\n          responsible any damage that was done during the day, unless he sent \r\n          the animal near a place where it could do damage. Imaam al-Baghawi (may \r\n          Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;The scholars said that whatever is \r\n          destroyed at night, the owner (of the animal) is held to be responsible \r\n          for that, because customarily the owners of gardens and orchards guard \r\n          them during the day, and the owners of livestock guard them at night, \r\n          so whoever goes against that practice has gone against what is customary. \r\n          This applies if the owner of the animals is not with them; if he is \r\n          with them then he is held to be responsible for whatever damage they \r\n          did.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Allaah \r\n          mentioned the story of Dawood and Sulaymaan concerning this matter, \r\n          as He said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p><i> \r\n          &ldquo;And (remember) Dawood (David) and Sulaymaan (Solomon), \r\n          when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep \r\n          of certain people had pastured at night; and We were witness to their \r\n          judgement.<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p><i> \r\n          And We made Sulaymaan (Solomon) to understand (the case); \r\n          and to each of them We gave Hukm (right judgement of the affairs and \r\n          Prophethood) and knowledge&hellip;&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p><i> \r\n          [al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:78]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Shaykh \r\n          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;The text \r\n          of the Qur&rsquo;aan praised Sulaymaan for his understanding that compensation \r\n          meant replacing it with something similar. Pasturing the sheep at night \r\n          means taking them out to graze at night, which took place in a vineyard. \r\n          Dawood ruled that the value of what had been destroyed should be paid \r\n          in compensation. He thought that the sheep were equal in value to the \r\n          destroyed crops, and he wanted to give them to the owner of the cultivated \r\n          field. But Sulaymaan ruled that the owners of the sheep were obliged \r\n          to pay compensation, and that they should repay in kind, by tending \r\n          the field until it was restored to its former state. He also took into \r\n          account the benefits that would be lost whilst the field was being restored, \r\n          so he ruled that the owners of the garden were to be given the livestock \r\n          and that they could take what the produced until it was equivalent to \r\n          the produce of the garden. They could benefit from the produce of the \r\n          sheep in place of the produce of the garden which they had lost. He \r\n          found that what the sheep produced during this period would be equivalent \r\n          to what the garden would have produced. This is the knowledge which \r\n          Allaah gave exclusively to Sulaymaan and for which He praised him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> If \r\n          the animal is under the control of a rider or of a person who is leading \r\n          it or driving it, then he is responsible for any damage that it may \r\n          cause with its front legs or mouth, but not for any damage that it may \r\n          cause with its back legs, because of the hadeeth, &ldquo;There is no compensation \r\n          for the back legs.&rdquo; According to the report of Abu Hurayrah, (the hadeeth \r\n          is), &ldquo;There is no compensation for the back legs of a dumb animal.&rdquo; \r\n          The animal is described as dumb because it does not speak. Compensation \r\n          here refers to compensation for damage done by the animal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Shaykh \r\n          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;In the case \r\n          of every dumb animal &ndash; such as cattle, and sheep &ndash; there is no compensation \r\n          for damage done by the animal if it did it by itself (i.e., was not \r\n          under the control of anyone), such as if it ran away from the person \r\n          under whose control it was and it did some damage. No one is obliged \r\n          to pay any compensation, so long as it was not vicious and its owner \r\n          was not being negligent about restraining it at night or keeping it \r\n          away from the markets and gathering-places of the Muslims. More than \r\n          one of (of the scholars) mentioned that there is no compensation to \r\n          be paid if the animal had escaped and was going by itself without anyone \r\n          leading it or driving it, except in the case of savage animals.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> If \r\n          it attacks a human being or another animal, and the only way of warding \r\n          it off is by killing it, and it is killed, then there is no obligation \r\n          to pay compensation, because it was killed in self-defence, and defending \r\n          oneself is permissible. So he does not have to pay compensation for \r\n          the consequences and because he killed it in order to ward off its evil; \r\n          if he killed it in order to ward off its evil, then the attacker is \r\n          the one who has killed himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Shaykh \r\n          Taqiy al-Deen said: &ldquo;He has to defend himself from the one who is attacking \r\n          him, and if he can only do that by killing him (the attacker), then \r\n          he has the right to do that, according to the consensus of the Fuqahaa&rsquo;&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Among \r\n          the items for which there is no obligation to pay compensation if they \r\n          are destroyed are: musical instruments; crosses; vessels for wine; books \r\n          of misguidance, myths and promiscuous material, because Ahmad narrated \r\n          from Ibn &lsquo;Umar that the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to take a dagger \r\n          then they both went out to the market of Madeenah in which there were \r\n          wineskins that had been brought from Syria. (Ibn &lsquo;Umar) tore them open \r\n          in the presence of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spilled their contents, \r\n          and he commanded his companions to do likewise.&rdquo; This hadeeth indicates \r\n          that it is required to destroy them and that no compensation for that \r\n          is due. But their destruction must be done on the authority of the ruler \r\n          and under his supervision, so as to protect people&rsquo;s interests and avoid \r\n          mischief. \r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzan Aal Fawzaan, p. 133"},{"id":"8693","question_id":"8693","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You did a mistake when you took the ring without permission \r\n    and when you did not tell your mother after you lost it.

By the same token, with regard to the debt that is \r\n    not yet due, waiving part of it in return for it being paid sooner is the same.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Rushd al-Maaliki said in his book <i>\r\n    Bidaayah al-Mujtahid<\/i> (2\/144): The argument of those who said that this is not permissible is that it is like paying extra if more time is \r\n    given, and there is consensus that that is haraam. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Others were of the view that it is \r\n    permissible, such as &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with them). This is also one of the two opinions of Imam \r\n    al_Shaafa&rsquo;i and Imam Ahmad. This view was also favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim.&nbsp; It was also regarded as \r\n    permissible by Ibn &lsquo;Aabideen among the Hanafi fuqaha&rsquo;, as stated in his footnotes on <i>al-Durr al-Mukhtaar<\/i>, 5\/160&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They quoted several things as evidence for its being permissible:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The report narrated by al-Haakim and \r\n    al-Tabaraani from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, according to which when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was commanded to expel Bani \r\n    al-Nadeer, some of them came to him and said: &ldquo;O Prophet of Allaah, you have been commanded to expel us but some people owe us money which is not \r\n    due to be paid yet.&rdquo; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Waive some of the debt so that they will pay \r\n    you sooner.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In <i>Majma&rsquo; al-Zawaa&rsquo;id<\/i> it says that its \r\n    isnaad includes Muslim ibn Khaalid al-Zinji, who is da&rsquo;eef (weak) but some regarded him as mawthooq (trustworthy). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said in <i>Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah<\/i> (1\/396): Its isnaad is hasan and there is nothing wrong with it apart from Muslim ibn Khaalid al-Zinji, whose \r\n    hadeeth does not go below the level of hasan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The words of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him): &ldquo;Rather riba means delay payment for me and I shall increase the amount; it does not mean bring forward the payment \r\n    and I will waive some of the debt.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; The fact that this transaction benefits \r\n    both parties (the lender and the debtor); the lender benefits from having the loan repaid sooner, and the debtor benefits from having part of the \r\n    debt waived.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They responded to the evidence of those who \r\n    regard it as haraam by stating that comparing this transaction to riba is not correct, because it is the opposite of riba. In the case of riba, \r\n    the debt is increased in return for delaying repayment, but in this case the debt and the time are both reduced. So how can something be compared \r\n    to its opposite? This is what is meant by the words of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas quoted above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the opposite of riba, for riba means \r\n    increasing the time allowed and the amount owed, which is harmful to the debtor. But what we are talking about means that the debtor pays off his \r\n    debt and the lender benefits by receiving repayment sooner. So both parties benefit without either being harmed, unlike the case of riba on which \r\n    there is consensus, because in that case the harm is done to the debtor, and all the benefit goes to the lender. This is the opposite of riba.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Standing Committee was asked about this \r\n    matter and said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is an issue concerning which there is a \r\n    difference of opinion among the scholars.

This \r\n    was narrated from Imam Ahmad and was the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh Ibn al-Qayyim.

That is because a ban on dealing in it means that it is no longer \r\n    valid and no longer has any value.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (6\/441):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We mentioned that the borrower should return the same amount, \r\n    whether the price has fallen or risen, or is still the same. &hellip; If the loan \r\n    was in coins that the ruler has banned, and they are no longer dealt in, \r\n    then the lender is entitled to the equivalent value, but he does not have to \r\n    accept it. &hellip; Maalik, al-Layth ibn Sa&rsquo;d and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i said: He is not \r\n    entitled to anything except what he lent, because that is not because \r\n    anything happened to what he lent, so it is like a decrease in its price. \r\n    The evidence for what we have said is that if the ruler bans it, then it \r\n    cannot be spent and it is no longer valid.

It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b, \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood that they forbade every loan that brings \r\n    benefits, because loans should be given as an act of kindness and an act of \r\n    worship aimed at bringing one closer to Allaah.

The owner of the money takes the land and benefits from its crops \r\n    or what the land produces, and the owner of the land does not take anything. \r\n    The agricultural land remains in the control of the creditor until the \r\n    borrower pays the money back to its owner.

I \r\n    asked the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) about that and he said: &ldquo;There is nothing wrong with taking it based on \r\n    the current price, so long as you do not separate with something still \r\n    outstanding.&rdquo; This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by some scholars, such as \r\n    al-Nawawi and Ahmad Shaakir; others classed the words of Ibn &lsquo;Umar, but not \r\n    the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \r\n    as saheeh, such as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar and al-Albaani. See: <i>Irwa&rsquo; \r\n    al-Ghaleel<\/i> (5\/173).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is another reason for \r\n    this prohibition, which is that if you take more than the price on the day \r\n    of repayment, then you have made a profit on something that is not in your \r\n    possession, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    forbade making a profit on anything that is not in one&rsquo;s possession. \r\n    Narrated by the authors of <i>al-Sunan<\/i> with a saheeh isnaad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>-3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>Where they agree at the \r\n    time of repayment to repay it in a different currency, but they part with \r\n    something till outstanding.

What is the ruling on that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They replied: It is \r\n    permissible to pay him back in Algeria the same amount in French currency or \r\n    the equivalent at the current rate of exchange in Algerian currency, so long \r\n    as it is handed over before you part. End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah \r\n    al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (14\/143).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They were also asked \r\n    (14\/144): What is the ruling on borrowing money in one currency then paying \r\n    the loan back a few months later in a different currency, when the price of \r\n    the currency may have changed during the period of the loan?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They replied: If a person \r\n    borrows money without stipulating any interest to be paid, or he repays it \r\n    in another currency at the rate of exchange at the time of repayment, \r\n    without stipulating anything that benefits the lender, that is permissible, \r\n    because that involves cooperation between Muslims and meeting their needs. \r\n    But if he stipulates that he has to pay interest on this loan or that he has \r\n    to give it back in a certain currency or offer any benefit to the lender, \r\n    then it is haraam, because it is riba that is forbidden according to the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and scholarly consensus. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: One of my relatives who lives in Cairo \r\n    has asked me for a loan of 2500 Egyptian pounds, and I sent him 2000 \r\n    dollars, which he sold and got 2490 Egyptian pounds. Now he wants to pay \r\n    back the loan. Please note that we did not agree on a time or method for \r\n    repayment. My question is: Should I take from him 2490 Egyptian pounds, \r\n    which is currently worth 1800 US dollars (less than the amount that I gave \r\n    him in dollars) or should I take 2000 dollars, knowing that this will mean \r\n    that he has to buy the dollars for approximately 2800 Egyptian pounds (i.e., \r\n    over 300 pounds more than he actually got)?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: What he must do \r\n    is return the dollars that he borrowed from you, because this is the loan \r\n    that he got from you. But if you agree that he will give you Egyptian \r\n    pounds, there is nothing wrong with that. Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) said: We used to sell camels in al-Baqee&rsquo; for dirhams and accept \r\n    dinars for them, and we would sell for dinars and accept dirhams. The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is \r\n    nothing wrong with taking it based on the current price, so long as you do \r\n    not separate with something still outstanding.&rdquo; This is selling one currency \r\n    for another, which is akin to selling gold for silver. If you and he agree \r\n    that he will repay you for these dollars in Egyptian pounds, so long as you \r\n    do not take from him more pounds than are dictated by the rate of exchange \r\n    at the time when you agree to that, there is nothing wrong with it. For \r\n    example, if 2000 dollars are equivalent to 2800 pounds now, it is not \r\n    permissible for you to take three thousand pounds from him, but it is \r\n    permissible for you to take 2800 pounds, and it is permissible for you to \r\n    take 2000 dollars only, i.e., you should take it at the current price or \r\n    less, and do not take more because if you take more, you will have made a \r\n    profit on something that is not in your possession, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade making a profit on \r\n    anything that is not in one&rsquo;s possession.. But if you take less, you will \r\n    have taken some of what you are entitled to, and waived the rest, and there \r\n    is nothing wrong with that.

That is indicated by the \r\n    report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2393) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) owed a camel of a certain age to a man, and a man came to \r\n    him and asked him to pay back the loan. The Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Give it to him.&rdquo; They looked for a camel of the \r\n    same age but they could not find anything except a camel that was more \r\n    mature. He said: &ldquo;Give it to him, for the best of you is the best in paying \r\n    off debts.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he lends \r\n    in general terms without any stipulations, then the borrower pays back \r\n    something that is more valuable or better than what he borrowed, or is less \r\n    valuable or worse, with the consent of both parties, that is permissible. &hellip; \r\n    Concessions allowing that were granted by Ibn &lsquo;Umar, Sa&lsquo;eed ibn al-Musayyab, \r\n    al-Hasan, al-Nakha&lsquo;i, al-Shu&lsquo;bi, al-Zuhri, Makhool, Qataadah, Maalik, \r\n    al-Shaafa&lsquo;i and Ishaaq. And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah upon him) borrowed a young camel and gave back something better than \r\n    it, and he said: &ldquo;The best of you is the best in paying off debts.&rdquo; Agreed \r\n    upon.

Al-Qaadi said: And there is a different opinion, \r\n    that it is makrooh, because he has hope based on that person&rsquo;s good habit. \r\n    But this is not correct. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) was known for being good in paying off loans but that does that make it \r\n    justifiable for anyone to say that lending to him is makrooh. Moreover, the \r\n    one who is known for being good in paying off loans is the best of people \r\n    and is the most deserving of people to have his needs met and his requests \r\n    answered and his hardship relieved.

When the \r\n    question is asked: why does Islam permit slavery? We reply emphatically and \r\n    without shame that slavery is permitted in Islam, but we should examine the \r\n    matter with fairness and with the aim of seeking the truth, and we should \r\n    examine the details of the rulings on slavery in Islam, with regard to the \r\n    sources and reasons for it, and how to deal with the slave and how his \r\n    rights and duties are equal to those of the free man, and the ways in which \r\n    he may earn his freedom, of which there are many in sharee&rsquo;ah, whilst also \r\n    taking into consideration the new types of slavery in this world which is \r\n    pretending to be civilized, modern and progressive.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When Islam came, there were many causes of slavery, such as \r\n    warfare, debt (where if the debtor could not pay off his debt, he became a \r\n    slave), kidnapping and raids, and poverty and need.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Slavery did not spread in this appalling manner throughout \r\n    all continents except by means of kidnapping; rather the main source of \r\n    slaves in Europe and America in later centuries was this method.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The texts of Islam took a strong stance against this. It says \r\n    in a hadeeth qudsi: &ldquo;Allaah, may He be exalted, said: &lsquo;There are three whose \r\n    opponent I will be on the Day of Resurrection, and whomever I oppose, I will \r\n    defeat &hellip; A man who sold a free man and consumed his price.&rsquo;&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (2227).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is worth pointing out that you do not find any text in the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah which enjoins taking others as slaves, whereas there are \r\n    dozens of texts in the Qur&rsquo;aan and the ahaadeeth of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which call for manumitting \r\n    slaves and freeing them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There were many sources of slaves at the time of the advent \r\n    of Islam, whereas the means of manumitting them were virtually nil. Islam \r\n    changed the way in which slavery was dealt with; it created many new ways of \r\n    liberating slaves, blocked many ways of enslaving people, and established \r\n    guidelines which blocked these means.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam limited the sources of slaves that existed before the \r\n    beginning of the Prophet&rsquo;s mission to one way only: enslavement through war \r\n    which was imposed on kaafir prisoners-of-war and on their womenfolk and \r\n    children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The \r\n    reason for slavery is kufr and fighting against Allaah and His Messenger. \r\n    When Allaah enables the Muslim mujaahideen who are offering their souls and \r\n    their wealth, and fighting with all their strength and with what Allaah has \r\n    given them to make the word of Allaah supreme over the kuffaar, then He \r\n    makes them their property by means of slavery unless the ruler chooses to \r\n    free them for nothing or for a ransom, if that serves the interests of the \r\n    Muslims. End quote from <i>Adwa&rsquo; al-Bayaan<\/i> (3\/387).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said: If the slave becomes Muslim then why keep him \r\n    as a slave, when the reason for slavery is kufr and fighting against Allaah \r\n    and His Messenger, so this reason no longer applies?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that the well known principle among the \r\n    scholars and all wise people, which is that the previously established right \r\n    cannot be erased by a right that is established later, and that what came \r\n    first takes precedence, is obvious.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When the Muslims captured kuffaar, their right to possession \r\n    was affirmed by the law of the Creator of all, Who is All Wise and All \r\n    Knowing. So this right is confirmed and established. Then if the slave \r\n    became Muslim after that, his right to escape slavery by embracing Islam was \r\n    superseded by the mujaahid&rsquo;s prior right to take possession of him before he \r\n    became Muslim, and it would be unjust and unfair to annul the prior right \r\n    because of a subsequent right, as is well known to all wise people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, it is good for the master to free the slave if he \r\n    becomes Muslim. The Lawgiver enjoined and encouraged that, and opened many \r\n    doors to it. Glory be to the Most Wise, the All Knowing. <i>&ldquo;And the Word of \r\n    your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His \r\n    Words.

End quote from <i>Adwa&rsquo; al-Bayaan<\/i> \r\n    (3\/389).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Capture of prisoners during war was the most common way of \r\n    acquiring slaves. Prisoners would inevitably be captured during any war, and \r\n    the prevalent custom at that time was that prisoners had no protection or \r\n    rights; they would either be killed or enslaved. But Islam brought two more \r\n    options: unconditional release or ransom. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them \r\n    without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islam)&rdquo; [Muhammad \r\n    47:4]<\/i>. During the battle of Badr the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) accepted ransoms from the mushrik prisoners of war \r\n    and let them go, and the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) let many of the prisoners go for free, releasing them with no \r\n    ransom. During the conquest of Makkah it was said to the people of Makkah: \r\n    &ldquo;Go, for you are free.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    During the campaign of Banu&rsquo;l-Mustaliq, the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married a female prisoner from \r\n    the defeated tribe so as to raise her status, as she was the daughter of one \r\n    of their leaders, namely the Mother of the Believers\r\n    <span>\r\n    Juwayriyah bint al-Haarith<\/span> (may Allaah be pleased with her). Then the \r\n    Muslims let all of these prisoners go.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam is not thirsty for the blood of prisoners, nor is it \r\n    eager to enslave them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus we may understand the limited ways that can lead to \r\n    slavery. Islam did not abolish it altogether, because the kaafir prisoner \r\n    who was opposed to truth and justice was a wrongdoer, or was a supporter of \r\n    wrongdoing or was a tool in the execution or approval of wrongdoing. Letting \r\n    him go free would give him the opportunity to spread wrongdoing and \r\n    aggression against others and to oppose the truth and prevent it reaching \r\n    people. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Freedom is a basic human right which cannot be taken away \r\n    from a person except for a reason. When Islam accepted slavery within the \r\n    limits that we have described, it put restrictions on the man who exploits \r\n    his freedom in the worst possible way. If he was taken prisoner in a war of \r\n    aggression in which he was defeated, then the proper conduct is to keep him \r\n    in reasonable conditions throughout his detention.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Despite all that, Islam offers many opportunities to restore \r\n    freedom to him and people like him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The principle of dealing with slaves in Islam is a \r\n    combination of justice, kindness and compassion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the means of liberating slaves is allocating a portion \r\n    of zakaah funds to freeing slaves; the expiation for accidental killing, \r\n    zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce that is forbidden), breaking vows and \r\n    having intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, is to free a slave. In \r\n    addition to that, Muslims are also encouraged in general terms to free \r\n    slaves for the sake of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is a brief summary of some of the principles of dealing \r\n    with slaves in a just and kind manner:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Guaranteeing them food and clothing like that of their \r\n    masters.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;They are your brothers whom Allaah has put under your \r\n    authority, so if Allaah has put a person&rsquo;s brother under his authority, let \r\n    him feed him from what he eats and clothe him from what he wears, and let \r\n    him not overburden him with work, and if he does overburden him with work, \r\n    then let him help him.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6050).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Preserving their dignity&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: I heard Abu&rsquo;l-Qaasim <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) say: &ldquo;Whoever accuses his slave when he is innocent of what he says \r\n    will be flogged on the Day of Resurrection, unless he is as he said.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6858).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) manumitted a slave \r\n    of his, then he picked up a stick or something from the ground and said: \r\n    There is no more reward in it than the equivalent of this, but I heard the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \r\n    &ldquo;Whoever slaps his slave or beats him, his expiation is to manumit him.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Muslim (1657).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Being fair towards slaves and treating them kindly&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn &lsquo;Affaan tweaked the ear of \r\n    a slave of his when he did something wrong, then he said to him after that: \r\n    Come and tweak my ear in retaliation. The slave refused but he insisted, so \r\n    he started to tweak it slightly, and he said to him: Do it strongly, for I \r\n    cannot bear the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. The slave said: Like \r\n    that, O my master? The Day that you fear I fear also.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) walked among his slaves, no one could tell him apart from them, because \r\n    he did not walk ahead of them, and he did not wear anything different from \r\n    what they wore.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One day &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab passed by and saw some slaves \r\n    standing and not eating with their master. He got angry and said to their \r\n    master: What is wrong with people who are selfish towards their servants? \r\n    Then he called the servants and they ate with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A man entered upon Salmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    and found him making dough &ndash; and he was a governor. He said to him: O Abu \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah, what is this? He said: We have sent our servant on an errand \r\n    and we do not want to give him two jobs at once.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; There is nothing wrong with slaves having precedence over \r\n    free men in some matters&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    - with regard to any religious or worldly matters in which he \r\n    excels over him. For example, it is valid for a slave to lead the prayer. \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah the Mother of the Believers had a slave who would lead her in \r\n    prayer. Indeed the Muslims have been commanded to hear and obey even if a \r\n    slave is appointed in charge of their affairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; A slave may buy himself from his master and be free.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person is enslaved for some reason but then it becomes \r\n    apparent that he has given up his wrongdoing and forgotten his past, and he \r\n    has become a man who shuns evil and seeks to do good, is it permissible to \r\n    respond to his request to let him go free? Islam says yes, and there are \r\n    some fuqaha&rsquo; who say that this is obligatory and some who say that it is \r\n    mustahabb.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what is called a mukaatabah or contract of \r\n    manumission between the slave and his master. Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of \r\n    emancipation), give them such writing, if you find that there is good and \r\n    honesty in them. And give them something (yourselves) out of the wealth of \r\n    Allaah which He has bestowed upon you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:33]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is how Islam treats slaves justly and kindly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the results of these guidelines is that in many cases, \r\n    the slave would become a friend of his master; in some cases the master \r\n    would regard him as a son. Sa&rsquo;d ibn Haashim al-Khaalidi said, describing a \r\n    slave of his:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He is not a slave, rather he is a son whom [Allaah] has put \r\n    under my care.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He has supported me with his good service; he is my hands and \r\n    my arms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another result of the Muslims treating slaves in this manner \r\n    is that the slaves became part of Muslim families as if they were also \r\n    family members. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Gustave le Bon says in <i>Hadaarat al-&lsquo;Arab<\/i> (<i>Arab \r\n    Civilization<\/i>) (p. 459-460): What I sincerely believe is that slavery \r\n    among the Muslims is better than slavery among any other people, and that \r\n    the situation of slaves in the east is better than that of servants in \r\n    Europe, and that slaves in the east are part of the family. Slaves who \r\n    wanted to be free could attain freedom by expressing their wish. But despite \r\n    that, they did not resort to exercising this right.

It says in Exodus 21:2-6:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six \r\n    years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a \r\n    wife when he comes, she is to go with him. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or \r\n    daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only \r\n    the man shall go free. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;5 But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife \r\n    and children and do not want to go free,' <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 then his master must take him before the judges. He shall \r\n    take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he \r\n    will be his servant for life&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for enslaving non-Hebrews, this is done by taking them \r\n    captive or overpowering them, because they believe that their race is \r\n    superior to others, and they try to find a justification for that slavery in \r\n    their distorted Torah. So they say that Ham the son of Noah &ndash; who was the \r\n    father of Canaan &ndash; angered his father, because Noah was drunk one day and \r\n    became naked as he was sleeping in his tent, and Ham saw him like that. When \r\n    Noah found out about that after he woke up, he got angry and he cursed his \r\n    progeny who were descendents of Canaan, and he said &ndash; according to the Book \r\n    of Genesis 9:25-26): &ldquo;Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to \r\n    his brothers.&rsquo; He also said, &lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May \r\n    Canaan be the slave of Shem.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the same chapter (v. 27) it says: &ldquo;May God extend the \r\n    territory of Japheth; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan \r\n    be his [or \r\n    their] slave&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the Book of Deuteronomy 20:10-14, it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer \r\n    of peace. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    11 If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it \r\n    shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    12 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in \r\n    battle, lay siege to that city. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    13 When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand, put to \r\n    the sword all the men in it. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    14 As for the women, the children, the livestock and \r\n    everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Attitude of the Christians towards slaves:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Christianity confirmed slavery as it had been affirmed \r\n    beforehand by Judaism. There is no text in the Gospels that prohibits or \r\n    denounces slavery. It is remarkable that the historian William Muir \r\n    criticized our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) for not immediately abolishing slavery, whilst overlooking the attitude \r\n    of the Gospels concerning slavery, as there is no report from the Messiah, \r\n    or from the Disciples, or from the churches concerning this issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Rather, in his Epistles, Paul advised that slaves should be \r\n    loyal to their masters, as he says in his Epistle to the Ephesians, where he \r\n    enjoins slaves to obey their masters as they would obey the Messiah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, \r\n    and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on \r\n    you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not \r\n    men, <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for \r\n    whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Ephesians 6:5-9).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i><span>Grand Larousse encyclop&eacute;dique<\/span><\/i>, \r\n    it says: It comes as no surprise that slavery has continued among Christians \r\n    until today; the official representatives of the faith have affirmed its \r\n    validity and accepted its legitimacy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; to sum up: the Christian religion approved fully of slavery \r\n    and still does so today. It is very difficult for anyone to prove that \r\n    Christianity strove to abolish slavery.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The saints affirmed that nature makes some people slaves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Churchmen did not prevent slavery or oppose it; rather they \r\n    supported it, to such an extent that the philosopher saint Thomas Aquinas \r\n    supported the philosophical view that agreed with the view of religious \r\n    leaders, and he did not object to slavery, rather he praised it because &ndash; \r\n    according to the view of Aristotle &ndash; it is one of the conditions in which \r\n    some people are created naturally, and it does not contradict faith for a \r\n    man to be content with the lowest position in life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Haqaa&rsquo;iq al-Islam<\/i> by al-&lsquo;Aqqaad \r\n    (p. 215).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the <i>Dictionary of the Bible<\/i> by Dr. George Yousuf it \r\n    says: Christianity did not object to slavery for political or economic \r\n    reasons, and it did not urge believers to oppose their generation&rsquo;s views \r\n    with regard to slavery, or even debate it, and it did not say anything \r\n    against the rights of slave owners or motivate the slaves to seek \r\n    independence; it did not discuss the harm or harshness of slavery and it did \r\n    not enjoin the immediate release of slaves. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It did not change anything in the nature of the relationship \r\n    between master and slave; on the contrary, it affirmed the rights and duties \r\n    of both parties.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Contemporary Europe and slavery&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is the reader&rsquo;s right, in this era of advancement and \r\n    progress, to ask questions about the pioneers of this progress and the \r\n    numbers of people who died because of the way in which they were hunted, and \r\n    who died on their way to the coast where the ships of the English Company \r\n    and others would wait, then the rest died due to changes in climate. \r\n    Approximately 4% died as they were being loaded onto the ships, and 12 % \r\n    during the journey, let alone those who died in the colonies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The slave trade continued at the hands of English companies \r\n    that obtained the right of monopoly with the permission of the British \r\n    government, then gave free rein to British subjects to enslave people. Some \r\n    experts estimate that the total number of people seized by the British \r\n    during slavery and exiled to the colonies between 1680 and 1786 CE was \r\n    around 2,130,000.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When Europe made contact with Black Africa, this contact led \r\n    to human misery during which the black people of that continent were faced \r\n    with a major calamity that lasted for five centuries. The states of Europe \r\n    came up with evil ways of kidnapping these people and bringing them to their \r\n    lands to serve as fuel for their revival, where they burdened them with more \r\n    work than they could bear. When America was discovered, the calamity \r\n    increased and they became slaves in two continents instead of just one.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica<\/i> says (2\/779) on the topic \r\n    of slavery: Hunting slaves in the villages that were surrounded by the \r\n    jungle was done by lighting fires in the straw of which the corrals \r\n    surrounding the villages were made, then when the villagers fled to open \r\n    land, the British hunted them down with whatever means they had at their \r\n    disposal. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    During the period from 1661 to 1774, for every million Black \r\n    Africans who reached the Americas, a further nine million died during the \r\n    hunting, loading and transportation. In other words, only one tenth of those \r\n    who were hunted survived and actually reached the Americas, where they found \r\n    no rest or relief, rather they were subjected to hard labour and torture.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    At that time, they had laws which any wise person would be \r\n    ashamed of.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among these evil laws were those which said that any slave \r\n    who transgressed against his master was to be killed, and any slave who ran \r\n    away was to have his hands and feet cut off, and he was to be branded with \r\n    hot iron; if he ran away again, he was to be killed. How could he run away \r\n    if his hands and feet had been cut off?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was forbidden for a black man to become educated, and the \r\n    jobs of whites were forbidden to coloureds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In America, if seven black people gathered together, that was \r\n    regarded as a crime, and if a white man passed by them it was permissible \r\n    for him to spit at them and give them twenty lashes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another law stated that the blacks had no soul and that they \r\n    possessed no smartness, intelligence or willpower, and that life existed \r\n    only in their arms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up, with regard to his duties and service to his \r\n    master, the slave was regarded as sane, responsible and punishable if he \r\n    fell short, but with regard to his rights, he had no soul and no being, and \r\n    he was not more than a strong pair of arms!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, after many centuries of enslavement and oppression, \r\n    there came the protocol to abolish slavery and strive to put an end to it, \r\n    in a resolution issued by the United Nations in 1953 CE.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence their consciences did not awaken until the last \r\n    century, after they had built their civilization on the corpses of free men \r\n    whom they had enslaved unlawfully. What fair-minded person can compare this \r\n    with the teachings of Islam, which came fourteen hundred years ago? It seems \r\n    that accusing Islam with regard to this topic is like the saying, &ldquo;She \r\n    accused me of her problem then walked away.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>Shubahaat Hawl al-Islam<\/i> by Muhammad Qutub; <i>Talbees Mardood fi \r\n    Qadaaya Khateerah<\/i> by Shaykh Dr. Saalih ibn Humayd, the Imam of the Haram \r\n    in Makkah.<\/td><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8742","question_id":"8742","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You should \r\n    note &ndash; may Allaah bless you &ndash; that our great religion has issued stern \r\n    warnings against forming relationships between the sexes outside the \r\n    framework of marriage.

We will answer them all &ndash; in sha Allaah &ndash; in the following points.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What you did with the servant woman is haraam \r\n    and is not permissible. A servant woman is not a slave woman whom it is permissible to touch and have intercourse with. A servant woman is free \r\n    and is not permissible for you except through marriage, which is what you did, but unfortunately you did it late.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The contract that existed between you and the \r\n    servant woman was a contract of employment, which was to serve you in your house. It was not a contract that permitted you to have intercourse \r\n    with her. You say that she agreed that you would be her master and she let you touch her and look at her, and that you freed her from the \r\n    contract, but this has no basis of validity in sharee&rsquo;ah in the sense that you refer to. A free woman cannot become a slave unless she is a kaafir \r\n    woman from a state that is at war with the Muslims and the Muslims have captured her. This does not apply in the case which you are asking about.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Slaves (men and women) may be taken in the \r\n    wars that take place between Muslims and kaafirs, not in wars that are fought amongst the Muslims at times of tribulation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Islam limited the sources of slaves which \r\n    existed before the mission of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to just one source, namely slavery resulting from \r\n    capturing prisoners from among the kuffaar, including women and children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said: The reason why a person may be taken as a slave is his being a kaafir and waging war against Allaah and His Messenger. If Allaah \r\n    enables the Muslims who are striving and sacrificing their lives and their wealth and all that Allaah has given them to make the word of Allaah \r\n    supreme over the kaafirs, then He allows them to enslave the kuffaar when they capture them, unless the ruler chooses to free them or to ransom \r\n    them, if that serves the interests of the Muslims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Adwa&rsquo; al-Bayaan<\/i>, \r\n    3\/387&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The mujaahideen take possession of slave \r\n    women as they take possession of the spoils of war. It is permissible for the one who gains possession of male or female slaves to sell them. In \r\n    both cases &ndash; owning a slave through battle or through purchase &ndash; it is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with a slave woman until \r\n    after she has had one menstrual cycle from which it may be established that she is not pregnant. If she is pregnant, then he must wait until she \r\n    has given birth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Ruwayfi&rsquo; ibn Thaabit al-Ansaari \r\n    said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say on the day of Hunayn: &ldquo;It is not permissible for any \r\n    man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to irrigate the crop of another else &ndash; meaning to have intercourse with a woman who is pregnant. And \r\n    it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to have intercourse with a captured woman until he has established that \r\n    she is not pregnant. And it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to sell any booty until it has been shared out.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2158; classed as \r\n    hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, 1890.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is permissible for there to be a physical \r\n    relationship between a man and his female slave just as there is between a man and his wife, unless he marries her off&nbsp; to someone else, in which \r\n    case it is not permissible for him to have intercourse with her because it is not permissible for a woman to be in an intimate relationship with \r\n    two men at the same time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There are no limits with regard to the age \r\n    difference between a man and his female slave, apart from the fact that it is not permissible for him to have intercourse with her until after she \r\n    has become able for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Sixthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The relationship between a man and his female \r\n    slave should be announced publicly and not kept secret. That is because there are rulings that stem from this announcement, such as if they have \r\n    children, and so as to ward off any suspicions that people who see them together may have concerning him and her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Seventhly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) owned some male and female slaves, among whom were the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Zayd ibn Haarithah ibn Shuraaheel, the \r\n    beloved of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He freed him and arranged his marriage to his freed slave \r\n    woman Umm Ayman, and she bore him Usaamah. His other slaves include Aslam, Abu Raafi&rsquo;, Thawbaan, Abu Kabshah Sulaym, Shaqraan (whose name was \r\n    Saalih), Rabaah (who was Nubian), Yassaar (who was also Nubian and was killed by the &lsquo;Arniyeen); Mid&rsquo;am and Kirkirah (another Nubian) &ndash; these two \r\n    were killed at Khaybar. They also included Anjashah al-Haadi and Safeenah ibn Farookh, whose real name was Mihraan, but the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him Safeenah (= &ldquo;ship&rdquo;) because they used to make him carry their luggage when they \r\n    traveled, so he said, &ldquo;You are a ship (anta safeenah).&rdquo; Abu Haatim said that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) freed him; someone else said that Umm Salamah freed him.

If they are shared out as part of the booty,\r\n    they become slaves, subject to the laws governing products which may be sold. But at the\r\n    same time, Islam urges the freeing of slaves and makes doing so an act of expiation for\r\n    numerous sins. In principle, slavery is not something that is desirable; what is\r\n    encouraged in Islam is the freeing of slaves. If a woman is enslaved according to\r\n    sharee&#146;ah, it is permissible for her master to have intercourse with her.

Some\r\n        people came, wanting to embrace Islam, and they were ambushed by the companions of Abu\r\n        Barzah. Then Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought to the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) the revelation of the punishment for killing and stealing\r\n        property, which is to be killed and crucified, and the punishment for killing without\r\n        stealing, which is to be killed&#133; Whoever steals property but does not kill should\r\n        have his hand and foot from opposite sides cut off. Whoever becomes Muslim, Islam cancels\r\n        out whatever deeds came before it at the time of <i>shirk<\/i>.&#148; (<i>Tafseer\r\n        al-Tabari<\/i>, 10\/260-261).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The reason for different levels of punishment<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>Different punishments for different degrees of hiraabah have been\r\n      prescribed for a very important reason. Hiraabah may take different forms, as is well\r\n      known, it might not involve only killing, or only stealing. It might involve both stealing\r\n      and killing, or it may involve neither, only terrorizing people. These different forms of\r\n      crime dictate different forms of punishment.<\/p>\r\n      <p>The basic principle in sharee&#146;ah is that the punishment should fit\r\n      the crime, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;The recompense for an\r\n      evil is an evil like thereof&#133;&#148; [al-Shoora 42:40]<\/i>. If these punishments did\r\n      not vary according to the crime, and there was room for choice, this might result in the\r\n      most severe punishment for one whose crime was the least serious, or the lightest\r\n      punishment for one whose crime was most heinous, which is a travesty of justice. The fact\r\n      that punishments vary according to the seriousness of the crime makes perfect common\r\n      sense.<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>Repentance of the muhaarib<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>If the muhaarib repents, it can only be either of the following two\r\n    scenarios:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Either he repents before he is caught<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>In this case, the punishment for hiraabah no longer applies, and he\r\n      should be treated like one who is not a muhaarib. The punishment of banishment,\r\n      amputation, or execution etc., no longer applies, except in cases where the victim or his\r\n      family have the right to demand retribution. The evidence for this is the words of Allaah\r\n      (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;The recompense of those who wage war against\r\n      Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or\r\n      crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the\r\n      land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the\r\n      Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and then) come back (as Muslims) with\r\n      repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is\r\n      Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#148; [al-Maa&#146;idah 5:33]<\/p>\r\n    <\/blockquote>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <\/i>\r\n      <li><p>Or he repents after he is caught<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>In this case the punishment for hiraabah still applies, and indeed the\r\n      ruler is obliged to carry it out, because the exception mentioned in the aayah clearly\r\n      applies only to one who repents before he is caught. It is not too difficult for a person\r\n      who wants to escape the prescribed punishment to feign repentance.<\/p>\r\n    <\/blockquote>\r\n    <p>This punishment is part of the Islamic sharee&#146;ah which Allaah has\r\n    prescribed for every time and place, not just for one particular country or period. The\r\n    Muslims applied this punishment for hiraabah at the time of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and until the present time. The fact that some of the\r\n    Roman and Pharaonic punishments were similar to those prescribed by Islamic law is of no\r\n    particular significance, good or bad. These Islamic punishments cannot be regarded as\r\n    backward or savage or barbaric at all. Any intelligent person who thinks about the\r\n    severity of the crime of hiraabah and the resulting lack of security in the cities and on\r\n    the road, terrorizing of the populace, robbing and killing, will know for sure that this\r\n    ruling is exactly what these criminals deserve. The one who looks at the way the\r\n    punishments for hiraabah fit the crime exactly will see that this is the essence of\r\n    justice. How can it be otherwise when the One Who has prescribed this law is the Almighty,\r\n    the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the Judge, the Just, the All-Aware?

The fuqahaa&rsquo; discussed in their books the rulings pertaining to prisoners,\r\n    their circumstances and how they should be treated. This concern stems from the Islamic\r\n    concern for the protection of man and respect for his humanity.<\/p>\r\n    <p>To make the matter easier to understand and to make the rulings more\r\n    clear, the scholars divided the subject-matter into two parts: the rulings pertaining to\r\n    the personal health of prisoners, and the rulings pertaining to health care in the place\r\n    that is used as a prison.<\/p>\r\n    <p>One: Rulings pertaining to the personal health of prisoners<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Imprisoning a sick person. The fuqahaa&rsquo; discussed the matter of\r\n        imprisoning a person who is sick in the first place &ndash; do the authorities have the\r\n        right to imprison a sick person? The answer is that this is the matter of ijtihaad, and\r\n        the final decision rests with the Qaadi (judge) who must weigh up the reason why this\r\n        person is to be imprisoned, the seriousness of his disease and the possibility of taking\r\n        care of him in jail. If sufficient health care is available for this sick person in\r\n        prison, and he is not suffering a serious illness which could kill him if he is detained,\r\n        it is permissible to imprison him. If such care is not available, the judge may hand him\r\n        over to someone who can treat him and guard him, without releasing him completely, until\r\n        it is possible to imprison him again.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>If a prisoner becomes sick whilst in jail. If a prisoner becomes sick\r\n        whilst in jail and it is possible to treat him there, then he must be treated without\r\n        bringing him out. Doctors and servants should not be prevented from going in to see him,\r\n        treat him and serve him. If not treating him leads to his death, criminal charges are to\r\n        be laid against those who were the cause of that, and they are to be punished. The Prophet\r\n<img>\r\n        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by a prisoner who was in chains, and he\r\n        called out, &ldquo;O Muhammad, O Muhammad!&rdquo; He came to him and said, &ldquo;What is the\r\n        matter?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am hungry &ndash; feed me. I am thirsty &ndash; give me\r\n        water.&rdquo; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that his\r\n        needs should be met. (Narrated by Muslim, 3\/1263). And no doubt\r\n        medical treatment is what the sick person needs.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>But if it is not possible to treat him inside the prison, he must be\r\n      taken out to a place where it is possible to treat him, under the supervision of the jail\r\n      or whoever is delegated to the task of watching and guarding him.<\/p>\r\n      <p>With regard to these rulings, the fuqahaa do not differentiate between\r\n      physical illness and psychological illness (true psychological illness, that is, as\r\n      opposed to the made-up psychological illness or the regular psychological illness which\r\n      many lawyers use as a means of getting criminals let off). Hence the fuqahaa&rsquo; (may\r\n      Allaah have mercy on them) stated that it is not permissible to lock the door on the\r\n      prisoner &ndash; so long as there is the certainty that he will not run away &ndash; or to\r\n      put him in a darkened room, or to harm him in any way or to do anything that will make him\r\n      terrified. His relatives should not be prevented from visiting him, because this will have\r\n      an effect on his health and psychology.<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>It is prescribed for the authorities or their representative to set up a\r\n        special medical wing in the prison, to take care of the prisoners&rsquo; health needs.

The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often\r\n    used to hand prisoners over to his companions and urge them to treat them well.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Rightly-Guided Khaleefah &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him) used to inspect the prisons, meet the prisoners in them and enquire\r\n    about their circumstances.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&lsquo;Umar ibn &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez, the fifth Rightly-Guided\r\n    Khaleefah, used to write to his employees, telling them to see how the prisoners were and\r\n    to take care of the sick among them.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The &lsquo;Abbaasi khaleefah al-Mu&rsquo;tadid allocated 1500 dinars of\r\n    the monthly budget to be spent on the needs and medical treatment of prisoners.<\/p>\r\n    <p>When the &lsquo;Abbaasi khaleefah al-Muqtadir imprisoned one of his\r\n    wazeers, Ibn Muqlah, the wazeer got sick. So the khaleefah sent the famous doctor Thaabit\r\n    ibn Sinaan ibn Thaabit ibn Qurrah to treat him in jail, and he urged him to treat him\r\n    well. The doctor used to feed him with his own hand and treated him very kindly.<\/p>\r\n    <p>At the time of the khaleefah al-Muqtadir, the wazeer &lsquo;Ali ibn\r\n    &lsquo;Eesaa al-Jarraah wrote to the head of the hospitals of Iraq at that time, telling\r\n    him: &ldquo;I have been thinking, may Allaah grant you long life, about those who are in\r\n    prison. With their large numbers and rough accommodation, they are not free from disease.\r\n    They are prevented from doing things which will benefit them and meeting with doctors whom\r\n    they can consult about the sicknesses they are exposed to. So you have to appoint doctors\r\n    for them who will go in and see them every day and take them medicine and drinks, and who\r\n    will go around to all the jails and treat the sick in them and prescribe medicine for\r\n    them.&rdquo; This care lasted throughout the khilaafah of al-Muqtadir, al-Qaahir, al-Raadi\r\n    and al-Muttaqi.<\/p>\r\n    <p>For more information, please see: <i>Ahkaam al-Sijn wa Mu&rsquo;aamilat\r\n    al-Sujanaa&rsquo; fi&rsquo;l-Islam<\/i>, p. 367-379; <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>,\r\n    part 16, p. 320-327<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Ahkaam al-Sijn wa Mu&rsquo;aamilat al-Sujanaa&rsquo; fi&rsquo;l-Islam, p. 367-379; al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 16, p. 320-327"},{"id":"8768","question_id":"8768","answers":"<p>A murderer has three rights on him.

He is to be executed by the Muslim \r\n    ruler or by his deputy &ndash; such as the qaadi or judge, and he is not to not be \r\n    washed (after death, in preparation for burial), the funeral prayer is not \r\n    to be offered for him and he is not to be buried with the Muslims. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence that the apostate is to be executed is the words \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    changes his religion, execute him.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2794). What is \r\n    meant by religion here is Islam (i.e., whoever changes from Islam to another \r\n    religion).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness \r\n    that there is no god except Allaah and that I am His Messenger, except in \r\n    one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., in the case of murder); a \r\n    married man who commits adultery; and one who leaves his religion and splits \r\n    form the jamaa&rsquo;ah (main group of Muslims).&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6878; \r\n    Muslim, 1676)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, 22\/180.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it will be clear to you that execution of the apostate \r\n    is something that is commanded by Allaah, when he commanded us to obey the \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

Perhaps you think that if a person \r\n    follows the truth and enters into it and embraces the one true religion \r\n    which Allaah has enjoined, then we allow him to leave it quite easily \r\n    whenever he wants and to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) that put him \r\n    outside of Islam, so he can reject Allaah, His Messenger, His Books and His \r\n    religion, and there is no punishment as deterrent, how will that affect him \r\n    and others who enter the religion?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Do you not see that this would make the one true religion, \r\n    that everyone should follow, like a shop or store which a person can enter \r\n    when he wants and leave when he wants, and it may encourage others to \r\n    forsake the truth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, this is not someone who has never known the truth \r\n    and practiced it and worshipped in accordance with it; rather this is a \r\n    person who has known the truth, and practiced the religion and done the \r\n    rituals of worship, so the punishment is no greater than he deserves. \r\n    Moreover, such strong rulings as this are only applied to such a person \r\n    whose life is no longer considered to be useful, because he knew the truth \r\n    and followed the religion, then he left it and forsook it. What soul can be \r\n    more evil than the soul of such a person?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In conclusion, the answer is that Allaah is the One Who \r\n    revealed this religion and enjoined it. He is the One Who ruled that the one \r\n    who enters it and then leaves it is to be executed. This ruling does not \r\n    come from the Muslims&rsquo; ideas or suggestions. As this is the case, then we \r\n    must follow the ruling of Allaah so long as we are content to accept Him as \r\n    our Lord and God.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and \r\n    which pleases Him.

Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There are more than fifty types of \r\n    effects of sin which are dealt with in detail in the book <i>al-Daa&rsquo; wa&rsquo;l-Dawaa&rsquo;<\/i>. When discussing the means of being patient in avoiding sin, \r\n    in his book <i>Tareeq al-Hijratayn<\/i>, he mentioned that some of the effects of sin are: blackness of face and darkness in the heart; stress, \r\n    worry, grief, anxiety and hardheartedness; being forsaken by Allaah, so He does not help or support one; sickness in the heart which, if chronic, \r\n    leads to death, for sins inevitably deaden the heart. Another effect is humiliation after being honoured; feeling alienated after feeling at ease; \r\n    feeling far away from Allaah after having found peace of mind in Him; poverty after richness, for he was rich and had capital, which is faith, \r\n    then when he lost his capital he became poor and deprived, and he can only get that wealth back by repenting sincerely and striving hard; loss of \r\n    provision, for a person is deprived of provision as a result of sins that he commits.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A seal and stain on the heart, for when a \r\n    person commits sin a black spot appears on his heart, but if he repents it disappears.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah, His angels and His slaves turn away \r\n    from him, for when a person turns away from obedience to Allaah and becomes busy with sin, Allaah and His angels turn away from him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In conclusion, the effects of sin are many \r\n    more than a person can grasp, and the effects of obedience are many more than a person can comprehend. The best of this world and the Hereafter \r\n    are to be found in obeying Allaah and the worst of this world and the Hereafter are all to be found in disobeying Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"8779","question_id":"8779","answers":"<span>Praise \r\n          be to Allaah. <\/span><\/big>&nbsp;\r\n        <p> \r\n          Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The fact that the hand of the thief (<i>saariq<\/i>) may \r\n          be cut off for three dirhams, and not in the case of the opportunist \r\n          thief (<i>mukhtalis<\/i>, one who steals when a person is not looking), \r\n          robber or extortioner (<i>ghaasib<\/i>, one who seizes something by force) \r\n          is indicative of the perfect wisdom of sharee&rsquo;ah. For one cannot take \r\n          precautions against the thief who breaks into houses and breaches one&rsquo;s \r\n          hiding-places and breaks locks; the owner of the goods cannot do any \r\n          more than that (i.e., hiding them in appropriate places). If it were \r\n          not prescribed for the hand of the thief to be cut off, then people \r\n          would steal from one another in this manner and a great deal of harm \r\n          would be done, and the problem of theft would be grievous indeed. This \r\n          is unlike the case of the robber and opportunist thief, for the robber \r\n          is the one who takes things openly in the sight of people, so they may \r\n          stop him and restore the rights of the one who has been wronged, or \r\n          they may testify before the judge. And the opportunist thief is the \r\n          one who takes things when the owner is not paying attention, etc., so \r\n          there has to be some form of negligence which enables the opportunist \r\n          to steal, otherwise when one is careful and alert, he cannot take anything. \r\n          So he is not like a thief (<i>saariq<\/i>), rather he is more like a \r\n          betrayer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Moreover, the opportunist theif (<i>mukhtalis<\/i>) does \r\n          not take things from a place where things of that nature are usually \r\n          hidden, rather he waits until you are not paying attention, then he \r\n          takes your things when you put something down for a moment and are not \r\n          paying attention. This is something against which precautions may be \r\n          taken in most cases, and he (the opportunist) is like the robber who \r\n          steals openly. With regard to the one who seizes things by force, the \r\n          case is more obvious: it is even more apt that his hand should not be \r\n          cut off, but it is permissible to put a stop to the actions of these \r\n          people by beating them, making an example out of them as a warning to \r\n          others, imprisoning them for lengthy periods and punishing them by seizing \r\n          their property.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: Alaam al-Muwaqqieen, 2\/48."},{"id":"8780","question_id":"8780","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Drinking alcohol is a major sin, and there are stern warnings \r\n    to the one who does that in many ahaadeeth which point to the seriousness of \r\n    this crime and the severe punishment for it by Allaah, one example of which \r\n    is the fact that the person&rsquo;s prayers will not be accepted for forty days. \r\n    This has been discussed in the answers to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]20037[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]38145[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]27143[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A number of scholars are of the view that this does not apply \r\n    only to prayer; rather other acts of worship will also not be accepted.

He \r\n    said: &ldquo;Every intoxicant is haraam.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari (4343) and Muslim (3032) narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) say from the minbar of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;O people, the prohibition of khamr was \r\n    revealed when khamr was made from five things: grapes, dates, honey, wheat \r\n    and barley. Khamr is whatever befogs the mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no doubt that drugs also befog the mind and take \r\n    away reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: The general meaning of the words, \r\n    &ldquo;Every intoxicant is haraam,&rdquo; is taken as evidence that whatever causes \r\n    intoxication is haraam, even if it is not a drink. So that includes hashish \r\n    and other things. Al-Nawawi and others were certain that it is an \r\n    intoxicant, and others were certain that dulls the senses, and it is \r\n    arrogant to say otherwise, because its visible effects are the same as those \r\n    of khamr, such as euphoria and addiction.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even if we assume that it is not an intoxicant, it is proven \r\n    in Abu Dawood that all intoxicants and relaxants are haraam. And Allaah \r\n    knows best. End quote from <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 10\/45.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Khattaabi said: \r\n    Relaxants are those drinks that cause relaxation in the muscles and numbness \r\n    in the extremities, which is the precursor to intoxication. It is forbidden \r\n    to drink them lest they be a means that leads to intoxication.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Everything that takes away \r\n    one's senses is haraam, even if it does not result in drunkenness or \r\n    intoxication. If it takes away the senses it is haraam according to the \r\n    consensus of the Muslims. With regard to using banj (lit. henbane) which \r\n    does not cause intoxication or take away reason, this is subject to a \r\n    ta&rsquo;zeer punishment. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars who studied the issue realized that hashish is \r\n    an intoxicant, and that it is only consumed by evildoers, because of the \r\n    pleasure and euphoria it brings. So it is like intoxicating drinks. Khamr \r\n    makes a person lively and argumentative, whereas hashish makes him relaxed \r\n    and lethargic, but it still befogs the mind and opens the door to physical \r\n    desires and&nbsp; heedlessness with regard to one's honour, which makes it worse \r\n    than intoxicating drinks. This is something that was introduced by the \r\n    Tatars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who consumes a little or a lot of it is to be \r\n    subjected to the punishment for drinking: eighty or forty lashes, if he is a \r\n    Muslim who believes that intoxicants are haraam. End quote from <i>\r\n    al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 3\/423&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Siyaasah al-Islamiyyah<\/i> (p. 92): Hashish \r\n    which is made from grape leaves is also haraam and the one who does that \r\n    should be whipped as the drinker of khamr is whipped. It is worse than khamr \r\n    in a way, because it corrupts the mind and mood, and robs a man of his \r\n    masculinity and makes him heedless about his honour, and other evil \r\n    consequences. But khamr is worse in another way, because it leads to \r\n    arguments and fights. Both of them keep a person from remembering Allaah and \r\n    praying. Some of the later fuqaha&rsquo; did not issue rulings on the punishment \r\n    for it, and they thought that the one who consumes it should be given a \r\n    ta&rsquo;zeer punishment that is less severe than the hadd punishment, because \r\n    they thought they thought that it alters the mind without causing euphoria, \r\n    like banj (henbane). We have not found any comment on it among the earlier \r\n    scholars, but that is not correct, rather those who consume it become \r\n    addicted to it like those who drink khamr, if not more so, and it keeps them \r\n    from remembering Allaah and praying if they consume a great deal of it. It \r\n    also causes other evil results such as heedlessness about one's honour and \r\n    loss of masculinity, corruption of one's mind and mood, and so on. Because \r\n    it is something solid and edible, and it is not a drink, the scholars \r\n    disagreed as to whether it is naajis (impure) and there are three opinions \r\n    in the madhhab of Ahmad and elsewhere. It was said that it is naajis like \r\n    khamr that is drunk &ndash; this is the correct view; and it was said that it is \r\n    not naajis because of its solid state, and it was said that a \r\n    differentiation should be made between its solid and liquid forms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whatever the case, it comes under the heading of that which \r\n    Allaah has forbidden of khamr and intoxicants, whether by name or by nature. \r\n    Abu Moosa al-Ash&rsquo;ari (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, advise us with regard to two drinks that we used to make in Yemen: \r\n    al-bit&rsquo; which is made of honey that is soaked until it becomes strong, and \r\n    al-mizr which is made of wheat and barley until it becomes strong. The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had \r\n    been given the gift of comprehensive and concise speech and he said: &ldquo;Every \r\n    intoxicant is haraam.&rdquo; Agreed upon in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i>. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He also said: How about \r\n    the person who persists in consuming hashish, especially if he believes that \r\n    it is permissible, as some people do? Such a person should be asked to \r\n    repent; if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be executed, \r\n    because intoxicants are haraam according to scholarly consensus, and \r\n    regarding them as permitted is undoubtedly kufr.

I said to them: To Allaah we belong and unto Him \r\n    is our return (said by Muslims at times of calamity). Do you not know that \r\n    haraabah (aggression) against honour is worse than aggression against \r\n    wealth? All people would agree to lose their wealth and have it confiscated \r\n    from them rather than to see aggression committed against their wives or \r\n    daughters.

With regard to the right of Allaah, \r\n    this is obvious, because it is casting aspersions upon His Message, His Book \r\n    and His Religion. As for the right of a human being, this is also obvious, \r\n    because it is like trying to slander the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) by this insult. In a case which involves both the \r\n    rights of Allaah and the rights of a human being, the rights of the human \r\n    beings are not dropped when the person repents, as in the case of the \r\n    punishment for banditry, because if the bandit has killed someone, that \r\n    means that he must be executed and crucified. But if he repents before he is \r\n    caught, then the right of Allaah over him, that he should be executed and \r\n    crucified, no longer applies, but the rights of other humans with regard to \r\n    qisaas (retaliatory punishment) still stand. The same applies in this case. \r\n    If the one who insulted the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) repents, then the rights of Allaah no longer apply, but there \r\n    remains the right of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him), which still stand despite his repentance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said, &ldquo;Can we not forgive him, because during his \r\n    lifetime the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    forgave many of those who had insulted him and he did not execute them?&rdquo; The \r\n    answer is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    sometimes chose to forgive those who had insulted him, and sometimes he \r\n    ordered that they should be executed, if that served a greater purpose. But \r\n    now his forgiveness is impossible because he is dead, so the execution of \r\n    the one who insults him remains the right of Allaah, His Messenger and the \r\n    believers, and the one who deserves to be executed cannot be let off, so the \r\n    punishment must be carried out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Saarim al-Maslool<\/i>, 2\/438&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Insulting the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) is one of the worst of forbidden actions, and it constitutes kufr \r\n    and apostasy from Islam, according to scholarly consensus, whether done \r\n    seriously or in jest. The one who does that is to be executed even if he \r\n    repents and whether he is a Muslim or a kaafir.

Rather what \r\n    they meant by saying that was that when the child reached puberty he was \r\n    following something other than Islam and he was not Muslim in either word or \r\n    deed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As the issue of apostasy is controversial and there is a \r\n    difference of opinion concerning it among the scholars, the matter should be \r\n    referred to the judge; whatever the shar&lsquo;i judge decides is what should be \r\n    applied in the case of one who reaches puberty as an apostate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whatever the case, we should not focus too much on a matter \r\n    concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion &ndash; which is the \r\n    question of whether he should be asked to repent or not &ndash; or ignore that on \r\n    which there is scholarly agreement, which is that he is a kaafir whose \r\n    destiny is the Fire of Hell, to abide therein for eternity. It is very \r\n    strange to see those who defend such a person saying that he is not an \r\n    apostate and that he should not be forced to become Muslim, and that he does \r\n    not come under the heading of an apostate. It is as if those say this want \r\n    to be compassionate and kind to him, but how do they know that they are not \r\n    harming him thereby. Those scholars who say that the hadd punishment for \r\n    apostasy should not be carried out on him did not suggest that he should be \r\n    left to his own devices; rather some of them said that efforts should be \r\n    made until he comes back to Islam; others said that he should be detained, \r\n    threatened and beaten until he becomes Muslim; others said that he should be \r\n    asked to repent, and if he repents all well and good, otherwise he is to be \r\n    executed for apostasy. Although this punishment may appear to be tough and \r\n    harsh, in fact it is true compassion and mercy towards him, because it may \r\n    save him from dying in a state of kufr, which if he dies in that state he \r\n    will deserve to spend eternity in the Fire of Hell.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is amazing is that it may take some people a lifetime to \r\n    come to Islam, and they may give up all that is precious to them in the \r\n    process, whilst this man has been granted an immense blessing by Allah, may \r\n    He be exalted, which is that He has caused him to be born to Muslim parents, \r\n    then he is ungrateful for this blessing and disbelieves in the One Who \r\n    bestowed it upon him, and he chooses to worship a human being or to venerate \r\n    a rock or an animal.

Ibn al-Qasaar and our shaykh\r\n    said: the Sahaabah agreed that [the person who does homosexual acts] should be killed, but\r\n    they differed as to how he should be killed.

This shows that there was consensus among them that [the person who does\r\n    homosexual acts] should be killed, but they differed as to how he should be executed. This\r\n    is similar to the ruling of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    concerning the person who has intercourse with a woman who is his mahram [incest], because\r\n    in both cases intercourse is not permitted under any circumstances.

Having intercourse in a manner that is not permissible under any circumstances is\r\n    worse than having intercourse in a manner which may be permitted in some circumstances, so\r\n    its punishment is more severe. This was stated by Ahmad in one of the two reports narrated\r\n    from him. (<i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, part 5, p. 40-41).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The same applies to the sin of lesbianism. There is no\r\n    doubt among the fuqahaa&rsquo; that lesbianism is haraam and is a major sin, as stated by\r\n    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him). (<i>Al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah\r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, part 24, p. 251).<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the specific type of punishment mentioned\r\n    in the question &ndash; stoning to death &ndash; this kind of punishment is for the\r\n    adulterer who is married. The shar&rsquo;i punishment for the crime of homosexuality is\r\n    execution &ndash; by the sword, according to the most correct view &ndash; as was narrated\r\n    in the discussion above about the differences among the scholars as to how this execution\r\n    should be carried out. As far as lesbianism is concerned, there is no hadd for it, but it\r\n    is subject to <i>ta&rsquo;zeer<\/i> [unspecified punishment to be determined at the\r\n    discretion of the qaadi]. (<i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, part 24, p. 253).<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if the person who does this evil deed, or any other\r\n    action which is subject to a hadd punishment, repents, gives up that sin, seeks\r\n    forgiveness, regrets what he has done and intends never to go back to it &ndash; Shaykh\r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about that, and he\r\n    answered:<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he truly repents to Allaah, Allaah will accept his repentance, and\r\n    he does not need to confess his sin to anyone so that the hadd punishment would be carried\r\n    out on him.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(<i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawaa<\/i>, part 34, p. 180).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with\r\n    Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit\r\n    illegal sexual intercourse &frac34; and whoever does this shall\r\n    receive the punishment.

From your question we may note the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The fact that you have cut off the route to the Shaytaan, \r\n    and are preventing him from continuing to tempt you, by getting married is \r\n    something commendable, which points &ndash; in sha Allaah &ndash; to the goodness in \r\n    your heart.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; In order for you to be sincere towards your Lord in your \r\n    repentance, and so that Allaah may change your bad deeds (sayi&rsquo;aat) into \r\n    good deeds (hasanaat), you have to stop thinking about the first woman. Do \r\n    not follow in the footsteps of the Shaytaan, and do not get carried away \r\n    thinking about her, let alone speaking to her on the telephone, let alone \r\n    meeting her, let alone doing anything that is more serious than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Since it was thinking of death that led you to leave the \r\n    first woman and get married, you should never stop thinking of it. This is \r\n    the best advice a person may be given, whether he is falling short in \r\n    obeying Allaah, or he is doing something that earns the wrath of Allaah. \r\n    This is what gives the one who is falling short the motive to strive, \r\n    because when death comes, good deeds are no longer recorded. It also gives \r\n    the one who is doing evil actions the motive to stop and give them up, \r\n    because a person&rsquo;s deeds are judged according to his last deeds. It is \r\n    sufficient for you to think of one thing: what if Allaah were to take your \r\n    soul when you were masturbating while talking to this woman? What if Allaah \r\n    were to take your soul when you were having unlawful intercourse with her?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My brother, think about it. Do you want to come out of your \r\n    grave on the day when mankind is resurrected, holding onto your private \r\n    part? Do you not see the great difference between this and between being \r\n    resurrected prostrating or reciting the Talbiyah (as on Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah) or \r\n    remembering Allaah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; The way in which you describe yourself makes us feel that \r\n    there is much that is good in you, so beware of losing the reward for this \r\n    goodness by having a bad end. Beware of depriving yourself of the reward for \r\n    these virtues by committing such a major sin that will bring the wrath of \r\n    your Lord upon you. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; You have no excuse for this relationship, for you are \r\n    married to a woman who &ndash; as you say &ndash; is more beautiful and is better than \r\n    the first one, so why not thank Allaah for giving you a halaal means of \r\n    satisfying your desires? Why are you not content with that which Allaah has \r\n    decreed for you of permissible things?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your sin in doing these haraam deeds is worse than if you \r\n    were not married. You are not single, rather Allaah has blessed you with the \r\n    means of satisfying your desires in a permissible way. So whenever the \r\n    Shaytaan makes you think of her (the first woman), go to your wife and seek \r\n    refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; We give you the best advice, which is to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. Get \r\n    up in the latter part of the night and beseech your Lord, submitting \r\n    yourself to Him and humbling yourself before His Majesty, asking Him to rid \r\n    you of the problem. Turn to your Lord and call upon Him, for He is the best \r\n    One to be asked &ndash; may He be glorified &ndash; and He does not turn away His slaves \r\n    if they are sincere.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; Do you know that by thinking of this girl, getting in \r\n    touch with her and meeting her, the Shaytaan may cause you to fall into that \r\n    which you did before? I hope that you will not be over-confident and think \r\n    that you will be able to resist, for the one who is ruled by his desires is \r\n    weak, and whoever walks for a few steps with the Shaytaan will walk with him \r\n    to the end. But you should know that you are incurring the wrath of the \r\n    Compeller (al-Jabbaar) and that you are committing one of the gravest acts \r\n    of disobedience against Allaah after <i>shirk<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I do not \r\n    know of any sin after murder that is worse than zina, and he quoted as \r\n    evidence the hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood who said: &ldquo;O Messenger of \r\n    Allaah, which sin is the worst?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Setting up a rival to Allaah when \r\n    He is the One Who created you.&rdquo; [&lsquo;Abd-Allaah] said: &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; He said, \r\n    &ldquo;Killing your child for fear that he may eat with you.&rdquo; [&lsquo;Abd-Allaah] said, \r\n    &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Committing adultery with your neighbour&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; And \r\n    confirmation of that was revealed in the Qur&rsquo;aan:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with \r\n    Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, \r\n    nor commit illegal sexual intercourse <!--[if supportFields]>SYMBOL 190 f \r\n    &quot;Symbol&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><![endif]--> \r\n    and whoever does this shall receive the punishment&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Furqaan 25:68]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You must also understand the effects that zina has on the \r\n    soul (or on one&rsquo;s psyche). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Zina encompasses all the characteristics of evil: lack of \r\n    religious commitment, loss of piety, loss of chivalry, lack of protective \r\n    jealousy (gheerah). You will not find any adulterer who is pious, or keeps \r\n    his promises, or speaks truthfully, or is a good friend, or has complete \r\n    protective jealousy towards his family. Treachery, lying, betrayal, lack of \r\n    modesty, lack of awareness that Allaah is always watching, lack of chivalry, \r\n    loss of protective jealousy from the heart &ndash; these are the effects and \r\n    implications of zina.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the effects of zina is that it earns the wrath of \r\n    Allaah because His sacred limits are transgressed. If a man were to do such \r\n    a thing to any king, he would meet the direst consequences. Another effect \r\n    of zina is the darkening of the face, and the grimness and misert of face \r\n    that are apparent to other people. Another effect of zina is darkness of the \r\n    heart and the extinguishing of its light, which is what causes the \r\n    extinguishing of light in the face and the darkening thereof. Another effect \r\n    of zina is the poverty that it leads to. Another effect of zina is the loss \r\n    of respect towards the one who does it, and the lowering of his status in \r\n    the eyes of his Lord and in the eyes of His slaves. Another effect of zina \r\n    is that is causes him to lose the best of attributes, namely chastity, \r\n    goodness and righteousness, and it earns him their opposites, namely \r\n    immorality, evildoing, adultery and betrayal. Another effect of zina is that \r\n    it causes him to lose the title of believer, as it was narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Saheehayn<\/i> that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;No adulterer is a believer at the moment when he is \r\n    committing adultery.&rdquo; Another of the effects of zina is that it exposes one \r\n    to the possibility of being one of the inhabitants of the oven (tannoor) in \r\n    which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw the \r\n    adulterers and adulteresses. Another of the effects of zina is that it takes \r\n    away the goodness which Allaah described as the attribute of those who are \r\n    chaste, and replaces it with the evil which Allaah described as the \r\n    attribute of the adulterers, as Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad \r\n    men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good \r\n    statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people \r\n    for good statements (or good men for good women)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:26]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has forbidden Paradise to every evil person, and He \r\n    has made Paradise the abode of the good, and no one will enter it but those \r\n    who are good. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a \r\n    pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allaah Alone) \r\n    saying (to them): Salaamun &lsquo;Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, \r\n    because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nahl 16:32]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and its keepers will say: Salaamun &lsquo;Alaykum (peace be \r\n    upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Zumar 39:73]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So they will deserve the greeting of the angels and admission \r\n    to Paradise because of their goodness. But the adulterers are among the most \r\n    evil of creation, and Allaah has made Hell the abode of evil and its people. \r\n    When the Day of Resurrection comes, the evil will be distinct from the good, \r\n    and the evil will be piled up together, then it and its people will be \r\n    thrown into Hell. No one who is good will enter Hell and no one who is evil \r\n    will enter Paradise. Another of the effects of zina is the sense of \r\n    alienation which Allaah instills in the heart of the adulterer, and this is \r\n    like the alienation that shows on his face. For the one who is chaste has \r\n    sweetness in his face and contentment in his heart, and whoever sits with \r\n    him feels at ease with him. But the adulterer has signs of alienation in his \r\n    face and whoever sits with him will feel uneasy. Another of the effects of \r\n    zina is lack of respect, as his family, friends and others lose respect for \r\n    him, and he becomes the most despicable thing in their sight; this is in \r\n    contrast to the chaste person, who is blessed with dignity and sweetness. \r\n    Another of the effects of zina is that people will regard him as a traitor \r\n    and no one will trust him with regard to his wife or child. Another of the \r\n    effects of zina is the foul odour that will emanate from him and be detected \r\n    by everyone who has a sound heart; it will emanate from his mouth and body, \r\n    and were it not for the fact that there are all the people have a similar \r\n    odour, that smell would spread far and wide.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another of the effects of zina is that he will feel uneasy \r\n    and distressed, for adulterers are doing the opposite of what they are \r\n    seeking. Whoever seeks the enjoyment and good things of life by means of \r\n    that which Allaah has forbidden, Allaah will punish him by letting him get \r\n    the opposite of that which he is trying to achieve. For that which is with \r\n    Allaah can only be attained by obeying Him, and Allaah never makes \r\n    disobedience towards Him the means of attaining anything good. If the \r\n    immoral person only knew what delight, happiness, ease and good living there \r\n    is in chastity, he would realize that the delights that he has missed out on \r\n    are many times greater than those which he may have enjoyed, let alone the \r\n    consequences in the Hereafter, when the chaste person will attain the reward \r\n    of Allaah and will be honoured by Him. Another of the effects of zina is \r\n    that he has exposed himself to missing out on the delights of al-hoor \r\n    al-&lsquo;iyn in the beautiful abodes of the Garden of Eden (Jannaat &lsquo;Adan). We \r\n    have stated above that Allaah will punish those who wear silk in this world \r\n    by depriving them of it on the Day of Resurrection, and He will punish those \r\n    who drink wine in this world by depriving them of it on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection. Similarly, those who enjoy forbidden images in this world will \r\n    also be deprived of such in the Hereafter. Indeed, everything that a person \r\n    gets in this world, if he indulges in it by permissible means, his share of \r\n    it on the Day of Resurrection will be reduced to the extent that he indulged \r\n    in it. And if he got it from haraam sources, he will lose out on it \r\n    altogether on the Day of Resurrection. Another of the effects of zina is \r\n    that zina leads to cutting the ties of kinship, disobedience towards \r\n    parents, haraam earnings, mistreating others, neglect of one's wife and \r\n    children, and it may even lead a person to shed blood unlawfully. He may \r\n    seek help to commit zina by means of sihr (witchcraft) and shirk, and he may \r\n    or not know that this sin inevitably includes other sins committed \r\n    beforehand or alongside it, and that it leads to other kinds of sins that \r\n    come after it. It is surrounded by a host of other sins that come before and \r\n    after. It is the thing that is most likely to bring about evil in this world \r\n    and the Hereafter, and the most likely to prevent good in this world and in \r\n    the Hereafter. If a person falls into its traps and snares, it will be hard \r\n    for sincere people to save him and for doctors to treat him; its prisoner \r\n    cannot easily be ransomed, and its victim cannot be rescued. It also leads \r\n    to the loss of blessings. If a person falls into this trap, let him bid \r\n    farewell to the blessings of Allaah, for blessings may easily depart from a \r\n    person and vanish. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;That is so because Allaah will never change a grace which \r\n    He has bestowed on a people until they change what is in their ownselves. \r\n    And verily, Allaah is All-Hearer, All&#8209;Knower&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Anfaal 8:53]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&nbsp;&ldquo;But when Allaah wills a people&rsquo;s punishment, there can \r\n    be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Ra&rsquo;d 13:10]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;These are some of the harmful effects of this action.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<i>Rawdat al-Muhibbeen<\/i>, \r\n    p. 360-363<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;We advise you to read a book by Ibn al-Qayyim which is very \r\n    useful with regard to this topic.

This is why he said that the private part either acts upon this \r\n  or it does not&#148;<\/p>\r\n<p>Zinaa is one of the forbidden deeds, one of the most serious \r\n  major sins (<i>kabaa&#146;ir<\/i>) after <i>shirk<\/i> and murder. Allaah says \r\n  (interpretation of the meanings): <\/p>\r\n<i>\r\n<p>&#147;And those who invoke not any other god along with Allaah, \r\n  nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit \r\n  illegal sexual intercourse &#150; and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. \r\n  The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide \r\n  therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds, \r\n  for those Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, \r\n  Most Merciful.&#148; [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]<\/p>\r\n<p>&#147;And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, \r\n  it is a faahishah [anything that transgresses its limits &#150; a great sin], \r\n  and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).&#148; [al-Isra&#146; \r\n  17:32]<\/p>\r\n<\/i> \r\n<p>Imaam al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &#147;The \r\n  &#145;ulama&#146; said that the phrase <i>And come not near to unlawful sexual \r\n  intercourse<\/i> is more eloquent than merely saying &#145;Do not commit zinaa&#146;, \r\n  because the meaning is, Do not even come close to zinaa.&#148; This means not \r\n  doing any deed that may get close to zinaa or lead to it, such as being alone \r\n  with a member of the opposite sex, touching, looking, going to evil places, \r\n  speaking in a haraam manner to a woman to whom one is not related, thinking \r\n  about and planning immoral acts, and so on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#145;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&#146;ood said: &#147;I \r\n  asked the Messenger of Allaah <img> (peace and blessings \r\n  of Allaah be upon him), &#145;Which sin is worst in the sight of Allaah?&#146; \r\n  He said, &#145;To make any rival to Allaah, when He has created you.&#146; I \r\n  asked, &#145;Then what?&#146; He said, &#145;To kill your child for fear that \r\n  he will eat with you.&#146; I asked, &#145;Then what?&#146; He said, &#145;To \r\n  commit zinaa with the wife of your neighbour.&#146;&#148; (Reported by \r\n  al-Bukhaari, 8\/492; Muslim, 1\/90).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All religions are agreed that zinaa is haraam; no religion \r\n  allows it. The punishment for zinaa is the most severe of punishments, because \r\n  it violates people&#146;s honour and lineages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sin of zinaa may be of varying degrees, \r\n  and the gravity of the offence depends on the nature and circumstances of the \r\n  deed, although all zinaa is haraam, a major sin and an act of immorality. Zinaa \r\n  with a mahram [i.e., incest] (Allaah forbid) or with a married woman is far \r\n  worse than zinaa with a woman to whom one is not related or with an unmarried \r\n  woman, because it involves violating the rights of the husband, contaminating \r\n  his bed, attributing a child to him that is not his, and other kinds of offence \r\n  and harm. If her husband is a neighbour, the crime of being a bad neighbour \r\n  is added to the offence; if her husband is one's brother or relative, the crime \r\n  of breaking family ties is added. The Prophet <img> (peace \r\n  and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: He will not enter Paradise whose \r\n  neighbour is not safe from his evil actions.&#148; (Reported by Muslim, \r\n  1\/68). There is no evil action worse than zinaa, and if the husband \r\n  is absent for the sake of Allaah, such as in worship, seeking knowledge or jihaad, \r\n  then the sin is compounded. Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported \r\n  that the Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n  be upon him) said: &#147;The wives of the mujaahideen are as sacred and forbidden \r\n  to those who stay behind as their own mothers. There is no man of those who \r\n  stay behind who is entrusted by one of the mujaahideen with the care of his \r\n  family and then betrays him (by committing zinaa), but he will be detained on \r\n  the Day of Resurrection, and (the one whom he betrayed) will take as much of \r\n  his good deeds as he wishes. So what do you think?&#148; (Reported by \r\n  Muslim, 3515). If the adulterer is married, the sin is greater, and the punishment \r\n  is stoning, and if he is an old man, the sin is greater and the punishment is \r\n  as the Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n  upon him) mentioned in the hadeeth about the three whom Allaah will neither \r\n  look at nor praise on the Day of Resurrection, and who will have a painful punishment.&#148; \r\n  (<i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, 156). If the deed is also committed \r\n  during a sacred month or in a sacred place or at a time which is special in \r\n  the sight of Allaah, the sin is compounded.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>The fuqaha&#146; (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that \r\n  the basic act of zinaa which carries the punishment is illegal sexual intercourse, \r\n  whereby the two &#147;circumcised parts&#148; [i.e. genitals] come together \r\n  and there is penetration of the tip of the penis, because this is actual penetration \r\n  (which carries the prescribed <i>hadd<\/i> or punishment).<\/p>\r\n<p>A person must avoid evil deeds and everything that can lead \r\n  to them. Allaah has commanded us to avoid the traps of the Shaytaan, because \r\n  if a man takes one step in that direction, his shaytaan and his own ego (nafs) \r\n  will keep urging him to do evil until he commits immoral deeds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One should think about how serious it is to \r\n  touch a woman to whom one is not related, as the Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: &#147;If one of you were \r\n  to be stabbed in the head with a piece of iron it would be better for him than \r\n  if he were to touch a woman whom it is not permissible for him to touch.&#148; \r\n  (Reported by al-Tabaraani; see also <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 5045). \r\n  This refers to the punishment for touching, so how about worse \r\n  deeds, such as embracing and kissing, and even worse kinds of illicit activity? \r\n  The Muslim qaadi is empowered to stipulate an appropriate punishment for every \r\n  proven action other than actual intercourse; in the case of intercourse, the \r\n  punishment set out by Islam is one hundred lashes and a year&#146;s exile for \r\n  one who is unmarried, and stoning for one who is married. This is the punishment \r\n  in this world, and the punishment in the Hereafter is far more severe.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>One of the important principles which the salaf (may Allaah \r\n  have mercy on them) pointed out is that the sincere believer who truly hopes \r\n  for Allaah and the Hereafter should not look at whether the sin is major or \r\n  minor, or whether is carries a punishment (hadd) or not. It was reported that \r\n  Ibn &#145;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: &#147;There is \r\n  no major sin if one asks for forgiveness, and there is no minor sin if one persists \r\n  in repeating it.&#148; Someone else said: &#147;If you want to disobey Allaah, \r\n  do not think about the smallness of the sin, think about the greatness of the \r\n  One Whom you are disobeying.&#148;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to the matter of repentance from \r\n  zinaa, please refer to the book &quot;I Want to Repent, \r\n  But...&quot;, &#133;&#148;, under the heading Books \r\n  on this website.

The Messenger of Allaah (S) saw \r\n    a clear resemblance to &lsquo;Utbah. But he said: &ldquo;He is yours, O &lsquo;Abd ibn Zam&rsquo;ah. \r\n    The child is for the (owner of the) bed.&rdquo; Then he said to Sawdah bint \r\n    Zam&rsquo;ah, who was one of the Mothers of the Believers (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them): &ldquo;Observe hijab from him, O Sawdah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the child was born in the marital bed, he is to be \r\n    attributed to the husband, and he cannot be regarded as not being his child \r\n    except by means of li&rsquo;aan, where the husband engages in li&rsquo;aan with his wife \r\n    and denies that the child is his, in which case physical resemblance is of \r\n    no significance. It is clear from the hadeeth quoted above that the child \r\n    concerning whom there was a dispute bore a clear resemblance to the zaani, \r\n    &lsquo;Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas. This case of zina had taken place during the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah (i.e., before Islam), and Sa&rsquo;d wanted to attribute the slave to \r\n    his brother who had left instructions to that effect (before he died), but \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ruled that the \r\n    child belonged to the marital bed and attributed him to Zam&rsquo;ah, who was the \r\n    master of the slave woman. But in order to be on the safe side, he told \r\n    Sawdah bint Zam&rsquo;ah to observe hijab before this brother of hers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So in this case there was both an admission of zina and a \r\n    clear resemblance (to the zaani), but despite that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) affirmed that the child was to be \r\n    attributed to the owner of the marital bed. This is because sharee&rsquo;ah takes \r\n    a cautious view in order to protect lineages and is keen to conceal sins, \r\n    for the lineage is the child&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Sharh \r\n    Muslim<\/i>: With regard to the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Observe hijab from him, O Sawdah&rdquo;, he \r\n    told her to do that so as to be on the safe side, because he appeared to be \r\n    her brother in shar&rsquo;i terms, because he was attributed to her father, but \r\n    when he saw that he clearly resembled &lsquo;Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas, he was afraid \r\n    that he may have been his child, in which case he would be a stranger \r\n    (non-mahram) to her, so he told her to observe hijab before him in order to \r\n    be on the safe side.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Qaadi &lsquo;Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The \r\n    custom during the Jaahiliyyah was to name children after the zaani.

Then Islam came and \r\n    abolished that, and ruled that the child belonged to the legitimate marriage \r\n    bed. When &lsquo;Abd ibn Zam&rsquo;ah and Sa&rsquo;d ibn Abi Waqqaas disputed, Sa&rsquo;d did what \r\n    his brother &lsquo;Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas had asked him to do, in accordance with \r\n    the custom of Jaahiliyyah, and Sa&rsquo;d was not aware that this had been \r\n    abolished in Islam. The child&rsquo;s paternity had not been stated during the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah, either because there was no claim or because the mother did not \r\n    acknowledge that he was &lsquo;Utbah&rsquo;s child. &lsquo;Abd ibn Zam&rsquo;ah claimed that he had \r\n    been born on his father&rsquo;s bed, so the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) ruled in his favour.

Some people say he will be accountable for it if his \r\n    intention reached the level of resolve. Some say that he is not accountable. \r\n    The answer is that if the intention reaches the level of resolve, then it \r\n    must be accompanied by some words or deeds (in order for a person to be \r\n    accountable for his intention).

This person will be accountable according to the \r\n    consensus of the Muslims. If a person strives to drink alcohol and tries by \r\n    his words and deeds to do that but fails, he is a sinner according to the \r\n    consensus of the Muslims. He is like one who drinks even if he does not \r\n    drink. Similarly if a person strives to commit zina or steal and so on, in \r\n    his words and deeds, but fails to do it, then he is a sinner like the one \r\n    who does it.

This is explained in his book <i>al-Jawaab \r\n    al-Kaafi&rsquo; li man sa&rsquo;ala &lsquo;an al-Dawa&rsquo; al-Shaafi<\/i>, which he wrote to deal \r\n    with this immoral action. We will quote some of what he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because the evil consequences of homosexuality are among the \r\n    worst of evil consequences, so its punishment is one of the most severe of \r\n    punishments in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars differed as to whether it is to be punished more \r\n    severely than zina, or whether the punishment for zina should be more \r\n    severe, or whether the punishments should be the same. There are three \r\n    points of view:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib, Khaalid ibn \r\n    al-Waleed, &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr, &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, Maalik, \r\n    Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, Imam Ahmad according to the more sound of the two \r\n    reports from him and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i according to one of his opinions, were of \r\n    the view that the punishment for homosexuality should be more severe than \r\n    the punishment for zina, and the punishment is execution in all cases, \r\n    whether the person is married or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, according to the well-known view of his madhhab, \r\n    and Imam Ahmad according to the other report narrated from him, were of the \r\n    view that the punishment for the homosexual should be the same as the \r\n    punishment for the adulterer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Abu Haneefah was of the view that the punishment for the \r\n    homosexual should be less severe than the punishment for the adulterer, and \r\n    it is a punishment to be determined by the judge (ta&rsquo;zeer).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who favoured the first view, who are the majority of \r\n    the ummah &ndash; and more than one scholar narrated that there was consensus \r\n    among the Sahaabah on this point &ndash; said that there is no sin that brings \r\n    worse consequences than homosexuality, and they are second only to the evil \r\n    consequences of kufr, and they may be worse than the consequences of murder, \r\n    as we shall see below in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: Allaah did not test anyone with this major sin \r\n    before the people of Loot, and He punished them with a punishment that He \r\n    did not send upon any other nation; He combined all kinds of punishment for \r\n    them, such as destruction, turning their houses upside down, causing them to \r\n    be swallowed up by the earth, sending stones down upon them from the sky, \r\n    taking away their sight, punishing them and making their punishment ongoing, \r\n    and wreaking vengeance upon them such as was not wrought upon any other \r\n    nation. That was because of the greatness of the evil consequences of this \r\n    crime which the earth can hardly bear if it is committed upon it, and the \r\n    angels flee to the farthest reaches of heaven and earth if they witness it, \r\n    lest the punishment be sent upon those who do it and they be stricken along \r\n    with them. The earth cries out to its Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, \r\n    and the mountains almost shift from their places.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Killing the one to whom it is done is better for him than \r\n    committing this act with him, because if a man commits sodomy with another \r\n    man, in effect he kills him in such a way that there is no hope of life \r\n    after that, unlike murder where the victim is wronged and is a martyr. They \r\n    said: the evidence for that (i.e., that the evil consequences of \r\n    homosexuality are worse than those of murder) is the fact that in the case \r\n    of murder, Allaah gives the next of kin the choice: if he wishes he may have \r\n    him executed and if he wishes he may let him off, but He enjoined executing \r\n    the homosexual as a hadd punishment, as the companions of the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah were unanimously agreed, and as is clearly indicated by the Sunnah of \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and \r\n    there is no evidence to the contrary; rather this is what his companions and \r\n    the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allaah be pleased with them all) did.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is narrated from Khaalid ibn al-Waleed that he found a man \r\n    among one of the Arab tribes with whom men would have intercourse as with a \r\n    woman. He wrote to Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) and \r\n    Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq consulted the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them). &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib had the strongest opinion of all of them, and he \r\n    said: &ldquo;No one did that but one of the nations, and you know what Allaah did \r\n    to them. I think that he should be burned with fire.&rdquo; So Abu Bakr wrote to \r\n    Khaalid and he had him burned. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The highest point in the town \r\n    should be found and the homosexual should be thrown head first from it, then \r\n    stones should be thrown at him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas derived this hadd punishment from the punishment \r\n    that Allaah sent upon the homosexuals of the people of Loot.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas is the one who narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the words:&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever you find \r\n    doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the \r\n    one to whom it is done.&rdquo; This was narrated by the authors of <i>al-Sunan<\/i> \r\n    and was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and others. Imam Ahmad quoted this \r\n    hadeeth as evidence, and its isnaad meets the conditions of al-Bukhaari.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: and it is narrated that he said: &ldquo;May Allaah curse \r\n    the one who does the action of the people of Loot, may Allaah curse the one \r\n    who does the action of the people of Loot, may Allaah curse the one who does \r\n    the action of the people of Loot,&rdquo; and it is not narrated that he cursed the \r\n    adulterer three times in one hadeeth. He cursed those who do a variety of \r\n    major sins, but he did not curse any of them more than once, but he repeated \r\n    the curse for the homosexual three times. The companions of the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) agreed unanimously \r\n    that the homosexual is to be executed, and none of them differed concerning \r\n    that. Rather they differed as to the method of execution. Some people \r\n    thought that this difference means that they disagreed about executing him, \r\n    so they narrated it as a matter concerning which the Sahaabah differed, but \r\n    it is a matter concerning which there was consensus among them, not a matter \r\n    of difference. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And they said: Whoever ponders the words of Allaah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And come not near to unlawful sex.

When Allaah mentioned \r\n    zina, He described it as a &ldquo;great sin&rdquo; (<i>faahishah<\/i> &ndash; indefinite) among \r\n    other great sins, but when He mentioned homosexuality, He called it &ldquo;the \r\n    worst sin&rdquo; (al-faahishah &ndash; definite). This suggests that it contains all the \r\n    essence of evil and sin.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Jawaab al-Kaafi<\/i> (p. 260-263).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said: With regard to homosexuality, some of the scholars said that the hadd \r\n    punishment for it is the same as the hadd punishment for zina, and it was \r\n    said that it is less than that. But the correct view on which the Sahaabah \r\n    were unanimously agreed is that both are to be killed, the active and the \r\n    passive partners, whether they are married or not. The authors of <i>\r\n    al-Sunan<\/i> narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it \r\n    and the one to whom it is done.&rdquo; And Abu Dawood narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    concerning the unmarried person who commits a homosexual act that he said: \r\n    He is to be stoned. And something similar was narrated from &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi \r\n    Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him). The Sahaabah did not differ \r\n    concerning the ruling that the homosexual is to be executed, but they \r\n    differed concerning the methods.

This was narrated from Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas. According to the other report, he is to be stoned. This was the \r\n    view of the majority of the salaf. They said: because Allaah stoned the \r\n    people of Loot, and stoning is prescribed for the zaani by analogy with the \r\n    stoning of the homosexual. Both are to be stoned, whether they are free or \r\n    slaves, or one of them is the slave of the other, if they have reached the \r\n    age of puberty. If one of them has not reached the age of puberty, he is to \r\n    be punished but not stoned, and none is to be stoned except one who has \r\n    reached puberty.&nbsp; End quote from <i>al-Siyaasah al-Shar&rsquo;iyyah<\/i>, p. 138.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one to whom it is done is like the one who does it, \r\n    because they both took part in the sin.

We have the view of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, and we do not know of any of \r\n    the Sahaabah who differed with him.

It was said to him: What about the woman? He said: It \r\n    applies to both of them. But out view is what was stated above, i.e., that \r\n    zina with a mahram is like zina with anyone else.

There are two \r\n    points of view. Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Maalik and Ahmad, according to one of the \r\n    reports from him, were of the view that he should be subjected to the hadd \r\n    punishment for zina. Ahmad, Ishaaq and a number of the scholars of hadeeth \r\n    were of the view that his punishment is execution whatever the case. End \r\n    quote from <i>al-Jawaab al-Kaafi<\/i>, p. 270.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured \r\n    the view that the one who commits zina with a mahram should be executed in \r\n    all cases. He said: The apparent meaning of the author&rsquo;s words is that there \r\n    is no difference between zina with a mahram relative and zina with anyone \r\n    else, but zina with a mahram is punishable by execution in all cases, \r\n    because of a saheeh hadeeth that speaks of that. This view was favoured by \r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim in <i>al-Jawaab al-Kaafi<\/i> , where he said that the one who \r\n    commits zina with a mahram should be executed whatever the case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example, if a man committed zina &ndash; Allaah forbid &ndash; with \r\n    his sister or his paternal aunt or his maternal aunt or his wife&rsquo;s mother or \r\n    the daughter of a wife with whom he had consummated the marriage and so on, \r\n    then he is to be executed whatever the case, because this intimacy is not \r\n    permissible to him under any circumstances whatsoever, because the woman is \r\n    one of his mahrams, and because this is a grave immoral action. There is \r\n    also a hadeeth which was narrated from the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about executing the one who has intercourse \r\n    with one of his mahrams. This was narrated from Ahmad, and it is the correct \r\n    view, that the one who commits zina with one of his mahrams should be \r\n    executed even if he was not married. End quote from <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;\r\n    <\/i>(6\/132).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (24\/20): The sin \r\n    of zina varies in severity. Zina with a mahram or married woman is worse \r\n    than zina with a stranger (non-mahram) or unmarried woman, because it is a \r\n    transgression against the sacred rights of the husband and corrupting his \r\n    lineage, and it may involve attributing offspring to him who are not his, \r\n    and other kinds of damage. So it is a worse sin than zina with a woman who \r\n    does not have a husband or who is a stranger (non-mahram). If her husband is \r\n    a neighbour then it also involves bad treatment of neighbours, and \r\n    mistreating neighbours is one of the worst kinds of mistreatment and one of \r\n    the worst sins that may doom a person to Hell. If the neighbour was a \r\n    brother or one of his relatives, it also involves severing ties of kinship, \r\n    so the sin is compounded. It was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;He will not enter Paradise from \r\n    whose harm his neighbour is not safe.&rdquo; There is no harm greater than zina \r\n    with one&rsquo;s neighbour&rsquo;s wife. If the neighbour is absent doing something in \r\n    obedience to Allaah, such as worship, seeking knowledge or jihad, then the \r\n    sin is compounded. The one who commits zina with the wife of one who is \r\n    fighting for the sake of Allaah will be made to stand before him on the Day \r\n    of Resurrection, and he will take as much of his good deeds as he wants. The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;The sanctity of the wives of the mujaahideen for those who stay behind is \r\n    like the sanctity of their own mothers. There is no man among those who stay \r\n    behind who looks after the family of one of the mujaahideen and then betrays \r\n    him with regard to them, but he will be made to stand on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection, and he (the mujaahid) will take as much of his good deeds as \r\n    he wishes, so what do you think?&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim (1897). i.e., do you \r\n    think he will leave him any of his hasanaat (good deeds)? It has already \r\n    been ruled that he has the right to take whatever he wants at the time when \r\n    all people will be desperate for even a single hasanah. If it so happens \r\n    that the woman was also his relative, the sin of severing ties of kinship \r\n    will be added to that. If it so happens that the zaani was also married, \r\n    then the sin is even greater. If he was an old man, the sin and punishment \r\n    will be greater. If that also occurred during a sacred month or in a sacred \r\n    place, or at a time that is held in high regard by Allaah, such as the time \r\n    of prayer or times when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are answered, the sin is further compounded. \r\n    End quote.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who has done any such thing should hasten to repent \r\n    to Allaah, may He be exalted.

If it means that they have to \r\n    tie her up, then they should tie her up. But the son should not beat his \r\n    mother, and with regard to treating her kindly, they have no right to do \r\n    otherwise. It is not permissible for them to cut off ties with her so that \r\n    she is free to do evil actions, rather they should try to prevent her from \r\n    doing evil as much as possible. If she needs provision and clothing they \r\n    should provide that for her.

One of them was al-Ghaamidiyyah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with her).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Buraydah ibn al-Haseeb said: A woman \r\n    from Ghaamid, a branch of al-Azd, came and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, \r\n    purify me!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Woe to you! Go back and seek the forgiveness of Allaah \r\n    and repent to Him.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;I think that you intend to send me back as \r\n    you sent Maa&rsquo;iz ibn Maalik back.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What has happened to you?&rdquo; She \r\n    said that she had become pregnant as a result of zina.

Then he (that Ansaari) came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &ldquo;The Ghaamidi woman \r\n    has given birth to a child.&rdquo; He (the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him)) said: &ldquo;Then we will not stone her and so leave her \r\n    child with no one to nurse him.&rdquo; One of the Ansaar stood up and said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, let me be responsible for ensuring that he is nursed.&rdquo; \r\n    Then she was stoned to death.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Muslim, 1695.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the attitude of the family of the woman asked about here, \r\n    claiming that she deserves to be executed, is wrong in other ways as well, \r\n    such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; They do not have the attitude if one of their sons or \r\n    brothers commits zina. This is like the actions of the people of the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah who allowed themselves to commit zina but not their women. And \r\n    these people feel that their honour has been besmirched and their protective \r\n    jealousy comes to the for if their women commit sin, but there is no \r\n    protective jealousy on their part if one of their sons or brothers does the \r\n    same thing. Indeed some fathers boast about their son&rsquo;s evil actions and \r\n    encourage him to do it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; They have opened the door for women to fall into sin, by \r\n    allowing women to attend mixed schools, have bad friends, watch haraam \r\n    things and sit in reprehensible gatherings. This has led to women&rsquo;s hearts \r\n    becoming deadened and attracted to immoral things. Some of them do not \r\n    arrange marriages for their daughters or sisters and they stipulate \r\n    impossible conditions, then they want to punish them when they are the ones \r\n    who deserve punishment more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; They don&rsquo;t only kill for the sin of zina, rather they do \r\n    that even if the woman only spoke to or got to know a non-mahram man, for \r\n    which there is no hadd punishment of killing in sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; They open the door for everyone who wants to kill his \r\n    sister or daughter on the grounds of nonsensical excuses, when the reason \r\n    for killing her may be her wealth, or because she knows things about them \r\n    that they want to conceal, or other such reasons.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From time to time we hear claims from the kaafir west or the \r\n    deviant east that everyone who kills his sister or daughter does so because \r\n    of honour.

For the attitude of the Muslims conquered the hearts of many of the mushrikeen before the Muslims&rsquo; swords and cavalry \r\n    conquered their strongholds, and they entered the religion of Allaah in crowds, seeking whatever it was in this religion that created such a good \r\n    attitude in its people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah says concerning this (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt \r\n    with them gently.

Concerning that Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And those who, when an oppressive wrong \r\n    is done to them, take revenge&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Shoora 42:39]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said, commenting on this verse:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the phrase &ldquo;<i>And \r\n    those who, when an oppressive wrong is done to them, take revenge<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; this does not contradict the idea of forgiveness, \r\n    because taking revenge may mean demonstrating the ability to take revenge, then one may forgive after that, in which case forgiveness will come in \r\n    a better context. Al-Nakha&rsquo;i said concerning this verse: They do not like to be humiliated, so if they are in a position to settle the score, then \r\n    they will forgive. Mujaahid said: They did not like for the believer to let himself be humiliated, which would lead the evildoers to feel contempt \r\n    for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the believer is wronged, then he should \r\n    show that he is able to take revenge, then he should forgive after that. Many of the salaf did that, including &lsquo;Ata&rsquo;, Qutaadah and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Jaami&rsquo; al-&lsquo;Uloom wa&rsquo;l-Hukam<\/i>, \r\n    1\/179&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence forgiveness is not good in all cases, \r\n    rather it may be blameworthy if it results in humiliation of the Muslim or encourages the aggressor even further, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah has referred to that in the verse \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allaah&rdquo; [al-Shoora \r\n    42:40]<\/i>. Here Allaah states that forgiveness is only good if it is done for the sake of reconciliation; if it leads to \r\n    bad consequences then it is not good.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the Muslim should look at which serves the greater interest &ndash; forgiveness or seeking revenge &ndash; and act accordingly. This will vary according \r\n    to circumstances and the people involved. What Imam Ahmad said about forgiving everyone who causes harm except for an innovator (mubtadi&rsquo;) is in \r\n    accordance with this, because he thought that forgiving the followers of bid&rsquo;ah would have bad consequences, which is that the people would be \r\n    encouraged to follow innovation. So he stated clearly that innovators were not to be forgiven, as a way of putting people off from those \r\n    innovations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    &ldquo;O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and \r\n    they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the way of Allaah, and never fear of the blame of \r\n    the blamers. That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows on whom He wills.

The mark of them (i.e. of their \r\n    Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Tawraat (Torah). But their \r\n    description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands \r\n    straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allaah has promised those among them who believe (i.e. \r\n    all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness \r\n    and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    [al-Fath 48:29]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So the Muslim has the right to forgive with \r\n    regard to things that have to do with him, i.e., his personal rights, but he does not have the right to remain silent when the sacred limits of \r\n    Allaah are transgressed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things \r\n    but he chose the easier of them, so long as it was not a sin. But if it was a sin he would be the furthest of the people from it. And the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never took revenge for himself, unless the sacred limits of Allaah were \r\n    transgressed, then he would take revenge for the sake of Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3367; Muslim, 2327&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is permissible for a Muslim to refrain \r\n    from taking revenge on a kaafir if the Muslim is in a weak position and is not strong.

So this verse was revealed, in which Allaah promised to defend the believers, and He expressly \r\n    forbade treachery and betrayal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tafseer al-Qurtubi<\/i>, \r\n    12\/67&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But when the Muslims grew stronger after \r\n    having been weak, Allaah gave the believers permission to fight, as He said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Permission to fight (against \r\n    disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allaah is Able to give them \r\n    (believers) victory&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Hajj 22:39]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Imam al-Qurtubi said, commenting on this \r\n    verse:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the phrase &ldquo;<i>Permission to \r\n    fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against<\/i>&rdquo;. It was said that this is the explanation of the words &ldquo;<i>Truly, \r\n    Allaah defends those who believe<\/i>&rdquo;, i.e., He wards off the plots of the kuffaar by allowing the Muslims to fight and by granting them victory. \r\n    It implies that He gave permission to fight to those who were able to fight, as is indicated by the context. Al-Dahhaak said: The companions of \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked for permission to fight the kuffaar because they had persecuted \r\n    them in Makkah, then Allaah revealed the words &ldquo;<i>Verily, Allaah likes not any treacherous ingrate to Allaah<\/i>&rdquo;.

Islam and medicine both urge people to \r\n          avoid the causes of disease and to protect themselves against it as \r\n          much as possible. The teachings of Islam urge us to protect our health \r\n          and to protect the foetus from many diseases which are caused by ignoring \r\n          the teachings of Islam and falling into sin such as zinaa (unlawful \r\n          sexual relationships), drinking alcohol, smoking, and taking drugs. \r\n          Modern medicine also warns mothers of the imminent danger of taking \r\n          some medications, or being exposed to x-rays or gamma rays, especially \r\n          in the early days of pregnancy.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>If it is proven in a definitive fashion, beyond \r\n          any doubt, by a trustworthy medical committee, that the foetus is deformed, \r\n          and that this deformity cannot be treated by the specialists, then in \r\n          my view it is permissible to abort it, in view of the difficulties it \r\n          would face in life and the hardship this would present to the parents, \r\n          and the burdens and responsibilities of care it would place on the society. \r\n          These considerations and others prompted the Islamic Fiqh Committee \r\n          of the Muslim World League in its 12<sup>th<\/sup> conference held in \r\n          Makkah on 15 Rajab 1410 AH (10\/2\/1990 CE), to issue the statement that \r\n          &ldquo;it is permissible to abort a foetus which is deformed in the manner \r\n          mentioned above, with the consent of the parents and within the first \r\n          120 days from the beginning of the pregnancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>The decision of the committee was in accordance \r\n          with the fatwa of the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing \r\n          Fatwas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, no. 2484, issued on 16\/7\/1399 \r\n          AH.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>But if the soul has been breathed into the \r\n          foetus and it has completed 120 days, then it is not permissible to \r\n          abort it, no matter what the deformity, unless continuation of the pregnancy \r\n          would put the mother&rsquo;s life in danger. This is because after the soul \r\n          has been breathed into the foetus, it is considered to be a person who \r\n          must be protected, regardless of whether it is free of disease or not, \r\n          and regardless of whether there is hope of recovery or not. That is \r\n          because Allaah has a reason for everything that He creates, which many \r\n          people do not know, and He knows best what is right for His creation, \r\n          as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><i><\/i><\/big><i>&ldquo;Should not He Who has created know? \r\n          And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves), All Aware (of \r\n          everything). <\/i><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><i>[al-Mulk 67:14]<\/i>&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>In the birth of these deformed children there \r\n          is a lesson for those who are of sound health, and it teaches us of \r\n          the power of Allaah Who shows His creation the manifestations of His \r\n          might and the wonders that He has created.

In the case of the Ghaamidi woman who had confessed to \r\n          zina and thus the punishment of stoning became obligatory, the Messenger \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her to go away until \r\n          after she had given birth, then after she had given birth, he told her \r\n          to go away until the child was weaned. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>4 &ndash; There are some fuqahaa&rsquo; who think \r\n          that it is permissible to have an abortion within the first forty days \r\n          of pregnancy. Some of them even permit it until before the soul is breathed \r\n          into the embryo. The stronger the excuse, the clearer the reason for \r\n          the concession is, and if that is within the first forty days it is, \r\n          this means that the concession is more appropriate. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>5 &ndash; Undoubtedly the rape of a Muslim \r\n          woman by an evil enemy is a strong reason for the Muslim woman and for \r\n          her family to have an abortion. For she will hate this foetus, the result \r\n          of this iniquitous attack, and she will want to get rid of it. So this \r\n          concession is to be given because of necessity, especially in the first \r\n          days of the pregnancy. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>6 &ndash; Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong \r\n          with a Muslim woman who has suffered this disaster keeping the foetus \r\n          without being forced to get rid of it. If it is decreed that it should \r\n          remain in her womb for the usual term and she gives birth to it, then \r\n          it will be a Muslim child, as the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Every newborn is \r\n          born in a state of fitrah (the natural state of man, i.e., Islam).&rdquo; \r\n          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). The fitrah is the religion of Tawheed, i.e., \r\n          Islam. It has been stated in fiqh that if the parents have different \r\n          religions, the child should follow the parent who has the best religion. \r\n          This is in cases where the father is known, but what about the child \r\n          who has no father? He is a Muslim child, no doubt, and the Muslim society \r\n          is obliged to take care of his upbringing, to spend on him and to bring \r\n          him up well. They should not leave the burden to his poor, suffering \r\n          mother. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>One of the basic principles of Islam \r\n          is to relieve distress and hardship, so if a Muslim girl who is keen \r\n          to remain chaste is exposed to bestial aggression and fears the effect \r\n          that this may have on her reputation or her honour, or fears that she \r\n          may be an outcast or that she may be subjected to harm such as being \r\n          killed, or she fears that she may suffer psychological or nervous diseases, \r\n          or that her sanity may be affected, or that shame may be brought upon \r\n          her family for a matter in which she is not guilty of any sin, or that \r\n          the child will not find any place of safety, then I say: that if this \r\n          is the case, there is nothing wrong with her aborting the foetus before \r\n          the soul is breathed into it, especially when it has become easy for \r\n          a woman to find out if she is pregnant or not, with the advance of medical \r\n          means of detecting pregnancy in the first week. The earlier the abortion \r\n          is carried out, the more appropriate this concession is.

Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan reported that\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Whoever is killed\r\n    defending his property is a <i>shaheed<\/i> (martyr), whoever is killed defending himself\r\n    is a shaheed, whoever is killed defending his religion is a shaheed, and whoever is killed\r\n    defending his family is a shaheed.&#148; In the commentary on this hadeeth it says:\r\n    &#147;whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed&#148; refers to the one who\r\n    defends the honour of his wife and female relatives.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a man is obliged to defend his wife and fight\r\n    off the one who wants to rape her &#150; even if this leads to his own death &#150; then\r\n    this obligation applies even more to the woman herself, who must defend herself and not\r\n    give in to the aggressor who wants to violate her honour, even if she is killed, because\r\n    if she is killed she will also be a shaheedah, just as her husband will be a shaheed if he\r\n    was killed defending her honour. Shahaadah (martyrdom, the status of shaheed) is a high\r\n    status which is only achieved by the one who dies in the way of obedience to Allaah and\r\n    that which He loves, which indicates that Allaah loves this kind of defence, a man&#146;s\r\n    fighting to defend his wife&#146;s honour and a woman&#146;s fighting to defend herself.\r\n    But if she is unable to defend herself, and the evil aggressor overpowers her and rapes\r\n    her by force, then she should not be subjected to any punishment (hadd or ta&#146;zeer);\r\n    rather, the punishment should be carried out on the evil aggressor.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> by Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbali:\r\n    &#147;Concerning a woman who was pursued by a man, and she killed him to protect herself,\r\n    Ahmad said: &#145;If she knew that he wanted [to rape] her, and she killed him to protect\r\n    herself, then she is not at fault.&#146; Ahmad mentioned the hadeeth which al-Zuhri\r\n    reported from al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, from &#145;Ubayd ibn &#145;Umayr, in which it said\r\n    that a man had visitors from [the tribe of] Hudhayl, and he wanted [to rape] a woman, so\r\n    she threw a rock at him and killed him. &#145;Umar said, &#145;By Allaah, there is no\r\n    diyah for him ever&#146; i.e., she did not have to pay the &#145;blood money&#146; for\r\n    him. If it is permissible to defend one's money, which one can give away, then a woman\r\n    defending and protecting herself and her honour which cannot be given away, is clearly\r\n    more permissible than a man defending his money. If this is clear, then she is obliged to\r\n    defend herself if she can, because letting someone overpower her [rape her] is haraam, and\r\n    by not defending herself, she lets him overpower her.&#148; [<i>al-Mughni<\/i>,\r\n    8\/331]<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best. <i>Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam\r\n    al-Mar&#146;ah<\/i>, 5\/42-43.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Turuq\r\n    al-Hukmiyyah<\/i>, 18: &#147;(Section) &#133; A woman who had committed zinaa was brought\r\n    to &#145;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), and he asked her about it\r\n    and she admitted it, so he commanded that she should be stoned. &#145;Ali said:\r\n    &#145;Maybe she had a reason.&#146; So he said to her, &#145;What made you do that?&#146;\r\n    She said, &#145;I had a partner who shared livestock with me; his camels had water and\r\n    milk, and mine had none.

I say: this is what should be done. If a woman is in desperate\r\n    need of food and drink from a man, which he will not give her unless she lets him have his\r\n    way with her, and she is scared that she will die without them, so she lets him have his\r\n    way with her, then she is not to be punished. If it were asked, is it permissible for her\r\n    in this situation to let him have his way with her, or does she have to suffer [her hunger\r\n    and thirst] with patience, even if she dies? The answer is that her case is like that of a\r\n    woman who is forced to commit zinaa, to whom it is said, &#145;Either you let me have my\r\n    way with you, or I will kill you.&#146; The woman who is forced to do this should not be\r\n    punished; she can save herself from being killed in this manner, but if she bears it\r\n    (i.e., being killed) with sabr (patience), this is better for her.

Hence the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If people were \r\n    given on the basis of their claims, people would make claims on the blood \r\n    and property of others.

The Prophet (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) demonstrated the wisdom behind not giving on the basis \r\n    of a mere claim, because if it were to be given on that basis, then some \r\n    people would make claims on the blood and wealth of others, and would regard \r\n    that as permissible, and the defendant would not be able to protect his \r\n    wealth or blood.

It may be that she is claiming \r\n    that he raped her because of an argument between them, so that he will be \r\n    punished or in order to blackmail him. So this is not proof that the crime \r\n    of rape has taken place, nor is it proof that the crime of zina has taken \r\n    place.

This is the difference between our father Adam (peace be upon \r\n    him) and Iblees.

He said, addressing \r\n    Allah (may He be glorified): <i>&ldquo;Because You have sent \r\n    me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your \r\n    Straight Path&rdquo; [al-A&lsquo;raaf 7:16]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The remedy to this problem begins with realising that you are \r\n    able to deal with it and that it will be easy once you arm yourself with \r\n    resolve, determination and willpower, and follow the example of millions who \r\n    have gone through all kinds of problems and troubles, but they remained \r\n    steadfast and overcame their troubles, and became a cause of happiness for \r\n    those around them and brought development and success to their countries and \r\n    communities. You are not less significant than them and your trials are not \r\n    greater than theirs; rather it is nothing but a voice echoing inside your \r\n    mind. So let your reason be the thing that leads you and energizes you to \r\n    turn a deaf ear to these whispers, no matter how loud they are; the passage \r\n    of time will help to reduce this voice bit by bit, until it has diminished \r\n    completely, by Allah&rsquo;s leave.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Remember the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills \r\n    himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. \r\n    Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the Fire of \r\n    Hell for ever and ever.

Compensation for any property damaged or \r\n    destroyed and diyah for the lives lost must also be paid by his male kin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It happened as the result of the driver swerving to avoid \r\n    danger, such as if something was coming towards him which he feared might \r\n    hit him, or if someone pulled out from the right or the left in such a way \r\n    that he could not stop, so he swerved to avoid that danger, and the accident \r\n    happened.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -4- <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If happened as the result of no cause on his part, such as if \r\n    one of his tires blew or a bridge collapsed beneath him and he could not \r\n    tell that there was something wrong with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In these two cases, he does not have to offer any expiation \r\n    or pay any compensation, because in the first case he was doing what he is \r\n    required to do of trying to avoid danger, so he was doing the right thing, \r\n    and no ground (of complaint) can there be against those who do good (cf. \r\n    al-Tawbah 9:91). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the second case he was doing the right thing and did not \r\n    commit any act of aggression or negligence, so he does not have to do \r\n    anything, because he did not cause the accident.

Hence the correct view is that it is haraam to shave it, \r\n    as was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him), because of the command of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to let it grow.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for saying that the reason for letting it grow is to be \r\n    different from the Jews and that this no longer applies, this is not \r\n    acceptable, because the reason is not only to be different from the Jews.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Rather what is proven in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> is: &ldquo;Be \r\n    different from the mushrikeen&rdquo; and in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> it also says: &ldquo;Be \r\n    different from the Magians.&rdquo; Moreover, being different from these people is \r\n    not the only reason, rather there is another, greater reason, namely \r\n    following the guidance of the Messengers (peace and blessings be upon them) \r\n    by keeping the beard.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the obligation to follow the fitrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And not changing the creation of Allaah in ways that Allaah \r\n    has not permitted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of these are reasons why it is obligatory to keep the \r\n    beard and let it grow, as well as being different from the enemies of \r\n    Allaah, such as the mushrikeen, Magians and Jews.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, the claim that the reason for letting the beard \r\n    grow no longer applies is not true, because most of the enemies of Allaah \r\n    today among the Jews and others shave their beards, as is well known to \r\n    anyone who has any knowledge of other nations and their actions. Even if we \r\n    assume that most of them today let their beards grow, this does not alter \r\n    the fact that it is prescribed in Islam to let the beard grow, because the \r\n    fact that the enemies of Islam imitate something that is prescribed for the \r\n    Muslims does not mean that it is no longer prescribed.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    paid attention to these matters, as is well known from his life story and \r\n    his actions, and he taught them to his ummah so that they would follow his \r\n    teachings and respect the mosque and take care of the places that were built \r\n    to establish the rituals of Islam.

Its effect is the formation of carbon dioxide which created bubbles \r\n    that make the colour of the dough lighter, and makes the dough expand during \r\n    baking and rise and increase in size. Yeast is also used to make beer, \r\n    nabeedh and other alcoholic drinks. The he yeast that is used commercially \r\n    is made from colonies of microscopic single-celled yeast organisms. Although \r\n    there are more than 600 kinds of yeast, only a few of them are used \r\n    commercially.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the amount of yeast in these pickles and the like is very \r\n    little, and it has dissolved in them, so that it does not have the effect of \r\n    causing intoxication or languor, there is nothing wrong with using yeast in \r\n    them, and eating these pickles.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the yeast has a lasting effect on them, such that if \r\n    the one who ate a lot of these pickles would become intoxicated or tired, it \r\n    is haraam to use the yeast in them, or to eat anything to which yeast has \r\n    been added in this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it become clear that pickles made from permitted foods \r\n    are permissible. It should be noted that the vinegar which is put with these \r\n    products or that is produced by pickling these materials, comes under the \r\n    heading of drinks that are originally permissible, and is a type of food \r\n    that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ate and praised, \r\n    saying, &ldquo;What a good condiment is vinegar.&rdquo; [Narrated by Muslim, 2051].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For a more detailed discussion on the ruling on vinegar, \r\n    please see the answer to questions no.\r\n    [fatout]106196[\\fatout] and\r\n    [fatout]113941[\\fatout].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is also nothing wrong with eating bread made with \r\n    yeast. The yeast (khameerah) that is added to the dough does not come under \r\n    the heading of khamr (intoxicant) that is haraam, and does not have any \r\n    effect of causing intoxication or languor, especially since cooking it with \r\n    fire alters the yeast completely, so that it no longer has any effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How should we respond to the ruling on the yeast that they \r\n    put in flour to help leaven it and make it easy to cook, as some people say \r\n    that it is khamr and it is not permissible to use it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My response to that is that there is nothing wrong with \r\n    putting yeast in the dough for the purpose of leavening it, because this \r\n    does not affect it at all. Moreover, I do not think that this yeast would \r\n    cause intoxication if a person were to eat it. The basic principle \r\n    concerning all foods and drinks and clothing is that they are permissible, \r\n    unless it is proven that they are haraam, because Allah, may He be exalted, \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;He it is Who created for you all that is on earth.

The evidence for that is that the Lawgiver prescribed \r\n    the &lsquo;aqeeqah for the newborn, and did not prescribe anything after that. \r\n    Taking these &ldquo;eids&rdquo; that are repeated every week or every year means that \r\n    they are likening them to Islamic festivals. This is haraam and it is not \r\n    permissible. There are no festivals in Islam apart from the three prescribed \r\n    festivals: Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and the weekly &ldquo;eid&rdquo;, which is Friday (Jumu&lsquo;ah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This does not come under the heading of customs and \r\n    traditions, because it is repeated.

The leader or founder \r\n      of the group benefits when a number of people who are part of that group \r\n      get together and send out messages to the group, open up topics for \r\n      discussion, and post a large number of high-quality video clips.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Global campaigns to alert \r\n      users of that site to global Islamic events that are suppressed and \r\n      ignored by the non-Muslim media, or to support oppressed peoples, or to \r\n      close a website or personal page.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spreading useful and \r\n      beneficial books, articles and websites among visitors to that site.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication between \r\n      friends and relatives, especially those who live far apart from one \r\n      another.

If he is a man of knowledge or a seeker thereof or a member of a da&lsquo;wah \r\n    group, then it is permissible and good, because of the benefits they have to \r\n    offer to the people. But for the one who joins it for evil purposes or for \r\n    whom there is no guarantee that he will be safe from temptation and may \r\n    easily slip, especially young men and women, it is not permissible for them \r\n    to sign up for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one who knows the reality of our times and the \r\n    temptation and turmoil that is knocking at the door of all of our houses \r\n    will not object to any faqeeh or mufti (religious scholar) who disallows \r\n    anything in which there is harm, whether it is totally or mostly harmful. \r\n    The fact that there is some small benefit does not encourage one to say that \r\n    it is permissible because there is still fear for the one who embarks upon \r\n    it. If what is good and beneficial is great and the evil and harm is small \r\n    or non-existent, then we may with a clear conscience say that it is \r\n    permissible. Hence some of our scholars were very strict about satellite \r\n    channels at first, because of the pure harm and evil in them; but when there \r\n    started to be some great good in them and completely Islamic channels were \r\n    founded, and receivers that only accepted those channels became available, \r\n    the view that they are permissible became valid; indeed we see that many \r\n    scholars have contributed to these channels and have useful programs on \r\n    them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one who cannot control himself on Facebook and \r\n    similar sites should refrain from joining them.

This may lead Muslims to doubt their religion and will \r\n    open the door to arguing about the Companions of Muhammad (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him). Some of the actors would inevitably have to \r\n    play the parts of Abu Jahl and his ilk, which means that they would utter \r\n    words reviling Bilaal and reviling the Messenger (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) and what he brought of Islam, and this is undoubtedly \r\n    wrong.

Although it may be hidden \r\n    from some people, it is not hidden from Allaah, may He be glorified, the \r\n    Lord of all people, and He is the one who has commanded Muslim women to \r\n    speak in a serious manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Nasheed sung by women or girls is one of the major doors of \r\n    fitnah. Even though some people argue about that, there will come a time \r\n    when there will be no excuse for anyone to argue about this fact except the \r\n    excuse of whims and desires, because once the door to deviation has been \r\n    opened, the people will open it to its widest extent, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Innovation may initially be a \r\n    handspan, then it increases until it becomes a cubit, then miles and \r\n    parasangs. <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (8\/425). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

And had it \r\n    not been for the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would \r\n    ever have been pure from sins.

The same applies to reciting \r\n    the talbiyah, responding to the adhaan and returning greetings. We say this \r\n    quoting from the fuqaha&rsquo; of the four madhhabs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Haashiyat al-Tahhaawi<\/i> (1\/161), which is a Hanafi \r\n    book, it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Fath<\/i>: The difference of opinion refers \r\n    to speaking out loud only, not to speaking in a soft or alluring voice.

Based on that, for a woman to learn Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    from a woman is better in my opinion than her learning Qur&rsquo;aan from a blind \r\n    man, because her voice with a tune is &lsquo;awrah. Therefore the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Tasbeeh is for men and \r\n    clapping is for women.&rdquo; It is not right for a man to hear her.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Mardaawi said in <i>al-Insaaf<\/i> (8\/31), which is a \r\n    Hanbali book:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, according to \r\n    a report narrated by Saalih: The greeting may be given to an old woman, but \r\n    not to a young woman.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Qaadi said: He only said that for fear lest he be tempted \r\n    by her voice.

End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The problem with listening to religious nasheed sung by girls \r\n    or women is that the one who does that thinks that it is a means of drawing \r\n    closer to Allaah and that it benefits people in religious terms, and he may \r\n    go further and think that it is a kind of calling people to Allaah or jihad \r\n    for His sake.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Abu &lsquo;Amr ibn al-Salaah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked: Some people say that listening to songs with the daff and flute \r\n    is permissible, and non-mahram women may be present, and they mix with them \r\n    sometimes or they watch them from nearby, and sometimes the men embrace one \r\n    another and they gather to listen to songs and beating of the daff by \r\n    beardless youths who sing for them, and they focus their gaze upon the faces \r\n    of these beardless youths, showing great interest in the singer and the \r\n    song, then they disperse dancing and handclapping. They think that this is \r\n    permissible and is a way of drawing closer to Allaah, and they say that it \r\n    is the best act of worship! Is that haraam or halaal? Should the one who \r\n    says that it is halaal be rebuked or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allaah be pleased with him) replied: It should be \r\n    noted that these are the brothers of the permissive people who are among the \r\n    most evil of the misguided groups and the most ignorant and foolish. They \r\n    have rejected the laws of the Prophets and shunned knowledge and the \r\n    scholars. They have donned the cloak of asceticism and claimed to have \r\n    turned their back on the world, but they have followed their whims and \r\n    desires. They occupy themselves with idle entertainment which is the sign of \r\n    idle people and sinners, and claim that it brings them closer to Allaah and \r\n    say that they are following the example of the righteous who came before \r\n    them. But they are telling lies against Allaah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted, and against His slaves whom He chose, and these are all tricks of \r\n    the shaytaan which they are using to deceive the masses. Their saying about \r\n    this listening that it is an act of worship and obedience is contrary to the \r\n    consensus of the Muslims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for whether it is permissible to listen to this, it should \r\n    be noted that if the daff, flute and singing come together, then listening \r\n    to that is haraam according to the imams of the madhhabs and other Muslim \r\n    scholars. It is not proven that any reliable scholar differed from that and \r\n    said it is permissible. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for what is said about them listening to beardless youths \r\n    alongside non-mahram women, believing that it is permissible, undoubtedly \r\n    this is the attitude of promiscuous people and the ideas of heretics, and no \r\n    one among the Muslims, their scholars and worshippers ever allowed that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fatwa is lengthy, and we have only quoted a few \r\n    paragraphs from it.

You should be certain that if what you say had any \r\n    shred of truth, you would see the musicians and those who listen to music \r\n    among the best and most moral of people, but is that in fact the case?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; As for \r\n    your accusing Islam of being backward when you hear of the prohibition on \r\n    music, this is the most serious thing that you have said. You have read what \r\n    your Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \r\n    and you know what all the scholars, including the four imams, have said.

How \r\n    can you compare between the ruling of Allaah and your own reasoning? How can \r\n    you spurn the way that was followed by the best of mankind and follow a \r\n    different way that none of the righteous ever followed?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Remember \r\n    that the religion of Allaah does not follow the whims and desires of anyone. \r\n    Allaah is the One Who has created the universe and mankind, and He knows \r\n    what is best for them in this life and in the Hereafter, so He issues \r\n    commands and prohibitions for what is best for them in both realms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We are happy \r\n    to learn that you are one of those who call people to this religion, and \r\n    that you are among those who pray and fast, but we wish you well and \r\n    whatever advice we give is that which is best for you. Carry on with your \r\n    worship and calling people to Islam, but beware of sin and beware of this \r\n    music and the immoral words that may accompany it. Songs generate hypocrisy \r\n    in the heart and make it sick; they do not guide to any good or forbid any \r\n    evil, on the contrary these songs promote love and haraam meetings, and even \r\n    if these instruments are not accompanied by words, they still make the heart \r\n    sick and do it no good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah has \r\n    given you something better than this, namely His Book, in which He speaks. \r\n    So read it and listen to it being read by readers whom Allaah has blessed \r\n    with beautiful voices, and you will see a great difference in your heart and \r\n    your life after that. Allaah has guided many people who were kuffaar after \r\n    they listened to the verses of the Qur&rsquo;aan, and you are more deserving of \r\n    being guided in this manner than others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You can also \r\n    listen to permissible nasheeds, which are filled with good words, wisdom and \r\n    exhortation, and you can enjoy listening to sounds that Allaah has created, \r\n    such as the sounds of birds and waves, for they are what still the heart, \r\n    not the sounds of musical instruments that Islam has forbidden us to use.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn \r\n    al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) discussed singing in detail in his \r\n    book <i>Ighaathat al-Lahfaan min Masaa&rsquo;id al-Shaytaan<\/i>; try to get a copy \r\n    and read it, for you will find much useful material in it, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Finally:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The best \r\n    advice we can give you is to fear Allaah, may He be exalted, and to seek \r\n    knowledge from sound sources.

The writer of this article is not a seeker \r\n    of shar&rsquo;i knowledge (taalib &lsquo;ilm) so it is not permissible for him to \r\n    discuss something in which he is not specialized. Hence he has made many \r\n    mistakes and said many ignorant things, and spoken about Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) without \r\n    knowledge. This is a sinful matter and is misguiding his readers. By the \r\n    same token it is not permissible for the media &ndash; newspapers, magazines, etc \r\n    &ndash; to give space to those who are not scholars of sharee&rsquo;ah to discuss shar&rsquo;i \r\n    rulings and write about things that are not their specialty, so that the \r\n    Muslims may be protected from their ideas and beliefs. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: Nothing can benefit the deceased after his death \r\n    except that which is indicated by the shar&rsquo;i evidence, such as the report in \r\n    which the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;When a man dies, his (good) deeds come to an end except three: ongoing \r\n    charity, beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who will pray for him.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Muslim, 1631.

So it is not permissible to resurrect them and revive \r\n    them after he has died, lest that sin be added to the sins that he committed \r\n    during his lifetime, because the harm of that extends to others, as the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    introduces a bad practice into Islam, the burden of that sin will be upon \r\n    him, as will the sin of those who do it after him, without that detracting \r\n    from their burden in the slightest.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 1017.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: With regard to his comment that &ldquo;There is no text in \r\n    the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan which forbids singing and music,&rdquo; this reflects his \r\n    ignorance of the Qur&rsquo;aan.

Another group says that it is every sound of \r\n    entertainment, which includes flutes, stringed instruments and so on. All of \r\n    these mislead men from the path of Allaah and cause misguidance. It is \r\n    proven that Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), the great Sahaabi \r\n    who was one of the scholars of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them) said, commenting on this verse: &ldquo;By Allaah, this refers to singing.&rdquo; \r\n    And he said: &ldquo;It causes hypocrisy to grow in the heart as water causes herbs \r\n    to grow.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And there are many ahaadeeth which point to the prohibition \r\n    of singing and musical instruments and indicate that they are a means which \r\n    leads to great evil and bad consequences.

It is proven that he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) granted a dispensation to women only, when \r\n    there are no men present, allowing them to beat the daff and sing nasheeds \r\n    which are free of any mention of love or the music and instruments, which \r\n    includes the permissive songs that exist nowadays. Rather he allowed \r\n    nasheeds that are free of such offensive characteristics and he allowed \r\n    beating the daff only, not other kinds of drums or musical instruments, to \r\n    proclaim marriage. It is narrated in saheeh ahaadeeth, as in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Bukhaari<\/i>, that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) forbade musical instruments of all types and issued stern warnings \r\n    against them. It is narrated in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> and other books of \r\n    hadeeth that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;There will be among my ummah people who will regard as permissible \r\n    zina (adultery), silk, alcohol and <i>ma&rsquo;aazif<\/i> (musical instruments). \r\n    Some people will camp at the top of a mountain with their shepherd looking \r\n    after their sheep, and a poor man will come and ask for something, and they \r\n    will say, &lsquo;Come back to us tomorrow.&rsquo; But Allaah will destroy them and level \r\n    the mountain, and will turn others into monkeys and pigs until the Day of \r\n    Resurrection.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The word <i>ma&rsquo;aazif<\/i> (translated above as musical \r\n    instruments) refers to singing and all kinds of instruments.

It is not permissible for anyone to go beyond the limits of Islam and follow something other than that which was narrated in the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    and Sunnah, whether that has to do with inward matters or outward, whether for the common man or the elite. But the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) granted a concession for some kinds of entertainment on the occasion of weddings and the like, and he also \r\n    granted a concession to women allowing them to beat the daff at weddings and on other joyous occasions. But with regard to the men of his time, \r\n    none of them used to beat the daff or clap his hands, rather it was proven in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> that he said, &lsquo;Clapping is for women, and Tasbeeh \r\n    is for men,&rsquo; and he cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Because singing, beating the daff and \r\n    clapping the hands are actions of women, the salaf used to call a man who did that mukhannath (effeminate), and they used to call male singers \r\n    makhaaneeth (pl. of mukhannath).

There is no contradiction between \r\n  the interpretation of &#8220;idle talk&#8221; as meaning singing and the interpretation \r\n  of it as meaning stories of the Persians and their kings, and the kings of the \r\n  Romans, and so on, such as al-Nadr ibn al-Haarith used to tell to the people \r\n  of Makkah to distract them from the Qur&#8217;aan. Both of them are idle talk. \r\n  Hence Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;Idle talk&#8221; is falsehood and singing. \r\n  Some of the Sahaabah said one and some said the other, and some said both. Singing \r\n  is worse and more harmful than stories of kings, because it leads to zinaa and \r\n  makes hypocrisy grow (in the heart); it is the trap of the Shaytaan, and it \r\n  clouds the mind. The way in which it blocks people from the Qur&#8217;aan is \r\n  worse than the way in which other kinds of false talk block them, because people \r\n  are naturally inclined towards it and tend to want to listen to it. The aayaat \r\n  condemn replacing the Qur&#8217;aan with idle talk in order to mislead (men) \r\n  from the path of Allaah without knowledge and taking it as a joke, because when \r\n  an aayah of the Qur&#8217;aan is recited to such a person, he turns his back \r\n  as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in his ear. If he hears anything \r\n  of it, he makes fun of it. All of this happens only in the case of the people \r\n  who are most stubbornly kaafirs and if some of it happens to singers and those \r\n  who listen to them, they both have a share of this blame. <\/big>(<i><span>Ighaathat \r\n  al-Lahfaan<\/span><\/i>, 1\/258-259).<span> \r\n  <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><i><span>&#8220;[Allaah \r\n  said to Iblees:] And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with \r\n  your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allaah&#8217;s disobedience)&#8230;&#8221; \r\n  [al-Israa&#8217; 17:64] <\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;It was narrated that Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n  &#8220;<\/span><i><span>And befool them gradually those \r\n  whom you can among them with your voice<\/span><\/i>&#8221; &#8211; his voice \r\n  [the voice of Iblees\/Shaytaan] is singing and falsehood.

Then he mentioned it in <i><span>Ighaathat \r\n  al-Lahfaan<\/span><\/i>, and it indicates that they (musical instruments) are \r\n  haraam.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>It \r\n  was narrated that Naafi&#8217; (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Ibn &#8216;Umar \r\n  heard a woodwind instrument, and he put his fingers in his ears and kept away \r\n  from that path. He said to me, O Naafi&#8217;, can you hear anything? I said, \r\n  No. So he took his fingers away from his ears and said: I was with the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he heard something like this, \r\n  and he did the same thing. <\/span>(<i><span>Saheeh \r\n  Abi Dawood<\/span><\/i>).<big> Some insignificant person said that this hadeeth \r\n  does not prove that musical instruments are haraam, because if that were so, \r\n  the Messenger of Allaah \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have instructed Ibn &#8216;Umar \r\n  (may Allaah be pleased with them both) to put his fingers in his ears as well, \r\n  and Ibn &#8216;Umar would have instructed Naafi&#8217; to do likewise! The response \r\n  to this is: He was not listening to it, but he could hear it. There is a difference \r\n  between listening and hearing. Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) (may Allaah have \r\n  mercy on him) said: Concerning (music) which a person does not intend to listen \r\n  to, there is no prohibition or blame, according to scholarly consensus. Hence \r\n  blame or praise is connected to listening, not to hearing. The one who listens \r\n  to the Qur&#8217;aan will be rewarded for it, whereas the one who hears it without \r\n  intending or wanting to will not be rewarded for that, because actions are judged \r\n  by intentions. The same applies to musical instruments which are forbidden: \r\n  if a person hears them without intending to, that does not matter. <\/big>(<i><span>al-Majmoo&#8217;<\/span><\/i>, \r\n  10\/78).<\/p>\r\n<p><span>Ibn \r\n  Qudaamah al-Maqdisi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: the listener is the \r\n  one who intends to hear, which was not the case with Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah \r\n  be pleased with them both); what happened in his case was hearing. The Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) needed to know when the sound stopped \r\n  because he had moved away from that path and blocked his ears. So he did not \r\n  want to go back to that path or unblock his ears until the noise had stopped, \r\n  so when he allowed Ibn &#8216;Umar to continue hearing it, this was because \r\n  of necessity. <\/span><span>(<i><span>al-Mughni<\/span><\/i>, 10\/173) <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>(Even \r\n  though the hearing referred to in the comments of the two imaams is makrooh, \r\n  it was permitted because of necessity, as we will see below in the comments \r\n  of Imaam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him).

His companions \r\n  clearly stated that it is haraam to listen to all musical instruments such as \r\n  the flute and the drum, even tapping a stick. They stated that it is a sin which \r\n  implies that a person is a <i><span>faasiq<\/span><\/i> \r\n  (rebellious evil doer) whose testimony should be rejected. They went further \r\n  than that and said that listening to music is <i><span>fisq<\/span><\/i> \r\n  (rebellion, evildoing) and enjoying it is <i><span>kufr<\/span><\/i> \r\n  (disbelief). This is their words. They narrated in support of that a hadeeth \r\n  which could not be attributed to the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They said: he should try not to \r\n  hear it if he passes by it or it is in his vicinity. Abu Yoosuf said, concerning \r\n  a house from which could be heard the sound of musical instruments: Go in without \r\n  their permission, because forbidding evil actions is obligatory, and if it were \r\n  not allowed to enter without permission, people could not have fulfilled the \r\n  obligatory duty (of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil). <\/span><span>(<i><span>Ighaathat \r\n  al-Lahfaan<\/span><\/i>, 1\/425). <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;Imaam \r\n  Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about playing the drum or flute, \r\n  if a person happens to hear the sound and enjoy it whilst he is walking or sitting. \r\n  He said: He should get up if he finds that he enjoys it, unless he is sitting \r\n  down for a need or is unable to get up.

Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) is the one \r\n  who narrated this report, then he said: Abu&#8217;l-Faraj and al-Qaffaal among \r\n  our companions said: the testimony of the singer and the dancer is not to be \r\n  accepted.

This is the view of Maalik and is the more \r\n  famous of the two views narrated from Ahmad. <\/big>(<i><span>al-Majmoo&#8217;<\/span><\/i>, \r\n  28\/113).<big> And he said: &#8230;Ibn al-Mundhir mentioned that the scholars \r\n  were agreed that it is not permissible to pay people to sing and wail&#8230; \r\n  the consensus of all the scholars whose views we have learned about is that \r\n  wailing and singing are not allowed. Al-Shu&#8217;bi, al-Nakha&#8217;i and Maalik \r\n  regarded that as makrooh [i.e., haraam]. Abu Thawr, al-Nu&#8217;maan &#8211; \r\n  Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) &#8211; and Ya&#8217;qoob and Muhammad, \r\n  two of the students of Abu Haneefah said: it is not permissible to pay anything \r\n  for singing and wailing. This is our view. And he said: musical instruments \r\n  are the wine of the soul, and what it does to the soul is worse than what intoxicating \r\n  drinks do. <\/big>(<i><span>Majmoo&#8217; al-Fataawa<\/span><\/i>, \r\n  10\/417).<\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Ibn Abi Shaybah (may Allaah \r\n  have mercy on him) reported that a man broke a mandolin belonging to another \r\n  man, and the latter took his case to Shurayh.

This is indicated by saheeh \r\n  reports. Shaykh al-Islam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: But the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made allowances for certain types \r\n  of musical instruments at weddings and the like, and he made allowances for \r\n  women to play the daff at weddings and on other joyful occasions. But the men \r\n  at his time did not play the daff or clap with their hands. It was narrated \r\n  in <i><span>al-Saheeh<\/span><\/i> that he said: &#8220;Clapping \r\n  is for women and tasbeeh (saying Subhaan Allaah) is for men.&#8221; And he cursed \r\n  women who imitate men and men who imitate women. Because singing and playing \r\n  the daff are things that women do, the Salaf used to call any man who did that \r\n  a mukhannath (effeminate man), and they used to call male singers effeminate \r\n  &#8211; and how many of them there are nowadays! It is well known that the Salaf \r\n  said this.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>In a similar vein is the \r\n  hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), when her \r\n  father (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon her at the time of Eid, \r\n  and there were two young girls with her who were singing the verses that the \r\n  Ansaar had said on the day of Bu&#8217;aath &#8211; and any sensible person \r\n  will know what people say about war. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n  said: &#8220;Musical instruments of the Shaytaan in the house of the Messenger \r\n  of Allaah \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)!&#8221; The Messenger of Allaah \r\n  had turned away from them and was facing the wall &#8211; hence some scholars \r\n  said that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) would not tell anybody off \r\n  in front of the Messenger of Allaah \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but he thought that the Messenger \r\n  of Allaah \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not paying attention to what \r\n  was happening. And Allaah knows best. He (the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said: &#8220;Leave them alone, \r\n  O Abu Bakr, for every nation has its Eid, and this is our Eid, the people of \r\n  Islam.&#8221; This hadeeth shows that it was not the habit of the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions to gather to \r\n  listen to singing, hence Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq called it &#8220;the musical instruments \r\n  of the Shaytaan&#8221;. And the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of this appellation and \r\n  did not deny it when he said, &#8220;Leave them alone, for every nation has \r\n  its Eid and this is our Eid.&#8221; This indicates that the reason why this \r\n  was permitted was because it was the time of Eid, and the prohibition remained \r\n  in effect at times other than Eid, apart from the exceptions made for weddings \r\n  in other ahaadeeth. Shaykh al-Albaani explained this in his valuable book <i><span>Tahreem \r\n  Aalaat al-Tarab<\/span><\/i> (the Prohibition of Musical Instruments). The Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of young girls singing \r\n  at Eid, as stated in the hadeeth: &#8220;So that the mushrikeen will know that \r\n  in our religion there is room for relaxation.&#8221; There is no indication \r\n  in the hadeeth about the two young girls that the Prophet \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was listening to them. The commands \r\n  and prohibitions have to do with listening, not merely hearing, just as in the \r\n  case of seeing, the rules have to do with intentionally looking and not what \r\n  happens by accident. So it is clear that this is for women only. Imaam Abu &#8216;Ubayd \r\n  (may Allaah have mercy on him) defined the daff as &#8220;that which is played \r\n  by women.&#8221; <\/span><span>(<i><span>Ghareeb \r\n  al-Hadeeth<\/span><\/i>, 3\/64).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2><u><span>An \r\n  inappropriate exception<\/span><\/u><\/h2>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Some of them make an exception \r\n  for drums at times of war, and consequentially some modern scholars have said \r\n  that military music is allowed. But there is no basis for this at all, for a \r\n  number of reasons, the first of which is that this is making an exception with \r\n  no clear evidence, apart from mere opinion and thinking that it is good, and \r\n  this is wrong. The second reason is that what the Muslims should do at times \r\n  of war is to turn their hearts towards their Lord. Allaah says (interpretation \r\n  of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><i><span>&#8220;They \r\n  ask you (O Muhammad) about the spoils of war.

How can you compare this to that? What \r\n  is strange is that this hadeeth is one of the strongest proofs against them. \r\n  The greatest speaker of the truth [Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq] called them musical \r\n  instruments of the Shaytaan, and the Messenger of Allaah \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of that appellation, but \r\n  he made an exception in the case of these two young girls who had not yet reached \r\n  the age of responsibility and the words of whose songs could not corrupt anyone \r\n  who listened to them. Can this be used as evidence to allow what you do and \r\n  what you know of listening (to music) which includes (bad) things which are \r\n  not hidden?! Subhaan Allaah! How people can be led astray! <\/span><span>(<i><span>Madaarij \r\n  al-Saalikeen<\/span><\/i>, 1\/493).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah \r\n  have mercy on him) said: &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) \r\n  was young at that time; nothing was transmitted from her after she reached the \r\n  age of puberty except condemnation of singing. Her brother&#8217;s son, al-Qaasim \r\n  ibn Muhammad, condemned singing and said that it was not allowed to listen to \r\n  it, and he took his knowledge from her. <\/span><span>(<i><span>Talbees Iblees<\/span><\/i>, 229).<\/span> Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may \r\n  Allaah have mercy on him) said: A group of the Sufis used this hadeeth &#8211; \r\n  the hadeeth about the two young girls &#8211; as evidence that singing is allowed \r\n  and it is allowed to listen to it, whether it is accompanied by instruments \r\n  or not. This view is sufficiently refuted by the clear statement of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah \r\n  in the following hadeeth, where she says, &#8220;They were not singers.&#8221; \r\n  She made it clear that they were not singers as such, although this may be understood \r\n  from the wording of the report. So we should limit it to what was narrated in \r\n  the text as regards the occasion and the manner, so as to reduce the risk of \r\n  going against the principle, i.e., the hadeeth. And Allaah knows best. <span>(<i><span>Fath al-Baari<\/span><\/i>, 2\/442-443).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Some people even have the \r\n  nerve to suggest that the Sahaabah and Taabi&#8217;een listened to singing, \r\n  and that they saw nothing wrong with it!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span>Al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said: We demand them \r\n  to show us saheeh isnaads going back to these Sahaabah and Taabi&#8217;een, \r\n  proving what they attribute to them.&nbsp; Then he said: Imaam Muslim mentioned \r\n  in his introduction to his <i><span>Saheeh<\/span><\/i> \r\n  that &#8216;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak said: The isnaad is part of religion. \r\n  Were it not for the isnaad, whoever wanted to could say whatever he wanted to.<\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Some of them said that the \r\n  ahaadeeth which forbid music are full of faults. No hadeeth was free of being \r\n  criticized by some of the scholars. Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n  said: The ahaadeeth which were narrated concerning music being haraam are not \r\n  full of faults as has been claimed. Some of them are in <i><span>Saheeh \r\n  al-Bukhaari<\/span><\/i> which is the soundest of books after the Book of Allaah, \r\n  and some of them are hasan and some are da&#8217;eef. But because they are so \r\n  many, with different isnaads, they constitute definitive proof that singing \r\n  and musical instruments are haraam.<\/span><span>&nbsp;<\/span> <\/p>\r\n<p><span>All \r\n  the imaams agreed on the soundness of the ahaadeeth which forbid singing and \r\n  musical instruments, apart from Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali, but al-Ghazzaali did \r\n  not have knowledge of hadeeth; and Ibn Hazam, but al-Albaani (may Allaah have \r\n  mercy on him) explained where Ibn Hazam went wrong, and Ibn Hazam himself said \r\n  that if any of (these ahaadeeth) were saheeh, he would follow that. But now \r\n  they have proof that these reports are saheeh because there are so many books \r\n  by the scholars which state that these ahaadeeth are saheeh, but they turn their \r\n  backs on that. They are far more extreme than Ibn Hazam and they are nothing \r\n  like him, for they are not qualified and cannot be referred to.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Some of them said that the \r\n  scholars forbade singing because it is mentioned alongside gatherings in which \r\n  alcohol is drunk and where people stay up late at night for evil purposes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah \r\n  have mercy on him) said: The response to this is that mentioning these things \r\n  in conjunction does not only mean that what is haraam is what is joined together \r\n  in this manner. Otherwise this would mean that zinaa, as mentioned in the ahaadeeth, \r\n  is not haraam unless it is accompanied by alcohol and the use of musical instruments. \r\n  By the same token, an aayah such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&#8220;<\/span><i><span>Verily, \r\n  he used not to believe in Allaah, the Most Great, <\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n<p><i><span>And \r\n  urged not on the feeding of Al&#8209;Miskeen (the poor).&#8221; <\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n<p><i><span>[al-Haaqqah \r\n  69:33-34]<\/span><\/i> <\/p>\r\n<p><span>would imply that it is not haraam to disbelieve in Allaah unless that \r\n  is accompanied by not encouraging the feeding of the poor. If it is said that \r\n  the prohibition of such things one at a time is proven from other reports, the \r\n  response to that is that the prohibition of musical instruments is also known \r\n  from other evidence, as mentioned above. <\/span><span>(<i><span>Nayl \r\n  al-Awtaar<\/span><\/i>, 8\/107). <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;Some of them said that &#8220;idle talk&#8221; does not refer to \r\n  singing; the refutation of that has been mentioned above. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah \r\n  have mercy on him) said: This &#8211; the view that it means singing &#8211; \r\n  is the best that has been said concerning this aayah, and Ibn Mas&#8217;ood \r\n  swore three times by Allaah besides Whom there is no other god, that it does \r\n  refer to singing. Then he mentioned other imaams who said the same thing. Then \r\n  he mentioned other views concerning the matter. Then he said: The first view \r\n  is the best of all that has been said on this matter, because of the marfoo&#8217; \r\n  hadeeth, and because of the view of the Sahaabah and the Taabi&#8217;een. <\/span><span>(<i><span>Tafseer \r\n  al-Qurtubi<\/span><\/i>).<\/span> <\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him), after quoting this \r\n  <i><span>Tafseer<\/span><\/i>, said: Al-Haakim Abu &#8216;Abd-Allaah \r\n  said in the <i><span>Tafseer<\/span><\/i> of <i><span>Kitaab \r\n  al-Mustadrak<\/span><\/i>: Let the one who is seeking this knowledge know that \r\n  the Tafseer of a Sahaabi who witnessed the revelation is a <i><span>hadeeth \r\n  <\/span><\/i>with<i><span> isnaad <\/span><\/i>according \r\n  to the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Elsewhere in his book, he said: \r\n  In our view this hadeeth has the same strength as a marfoo&#8217; report. Although \r\n  their tafseer is still subject to further examination, it is still more readily \r\n  acceptable than the tafseer of those who came after them, because they are the \r\n  most knowledgeable among this ummah of what Allaah meant in his Book. It was \r\n  revealed among them and they were the first people to be addressed by it. They \r\n  heard the tafseer from the Messenger \r\n  <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in word and in deed. And they were \r\n  Arabs who understood the true meanings of (Arabic) words, so Muslims should \r\n  avoid resorting to any other interpretation as much as possible.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Some of them said that singing \r\n  is a form of worship if the intention is for it to help one to obey Allaah!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \r\n  have mercy on him) said: How strange!

Indeed, if they hear the Qur&#8217;aan, \r\n  they hear it with an inattentive heart and talk whilst it is being recited, \r\n  but if they hear whistling and clapping of hands, they lower their voices and \r\n  keep still, and pay attention. <\/span><span>(<i><span>Majmoo&#8217; al-Fataawa<\/span><\/i>, 11\/557 ff)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;<\/span><span>Some say that music and \r\n  musical instruments have the effect of softening people&#8217;s hearts and creating \r\n  gentle feelings.

We should not be deceived by the \r\n  fame of a man in our own times in which the people who are truly committed to \r\n  Islam have become strangers. The one who says that singing and musical instruments \r\n  are permitted is simply supporting the whims of people nowadays, as if the masses \r\n  were issuing fatwas and he is simply signing them!

Then they will look for evidence, or just specious \r\n  arguments which are worth no more than a lump of dead meat.

There is no dispute among scholars of the Arabic\r\n    language on this point. If they were halaal, he would not have condemned those who\r\n    permitted them, or compared permitting them to permitting wine and zina.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We may understand from the hadeeth that all kinds of musical\r\n    instruments are forbidden. This is clear from the hadeeth for a number of reasons:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said\r\n        &#147;&#133; there will be people who allow&#133;&#148; It is clear that the things listed\r\n        here, including musical instruments, are forbidden in sharee&#146;ah, but those people\r\n        will allow them.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>He compared musical instruments to things that are definitely known to\r\n        be haraam, namely zina and alcohol. If instruments were not haraam, he would not have made\r\n        this comparison. The evidence of this hadeeth that singing is haraam is definitive. Even\r\n        if no other hadeeth or aayah spoke about musical instruments, this hadeeth would be\r\n        sufficient to prove that they are haraam, especially the kind of singing that is known\r\n        among people nowadays, the essence of which is obscenity and foul talk, based on all kinds\r\n        of musical instruments such as guitars, drums, flutes, ouds, zithers, organs, pianos,\r\n        violins and other things that make it more enticing, such as the voices of these\r\n        effeminate singers and whores.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>(See <i>Hukm al-Ma&#146;aazif<\/i> by al-Albaani, <i>Tas-heeh\r\n    al-Ahkta&#146; wa&#146;l-Awhaam al-Waaqi&#146;ah fi Ahaadeeth al-Nabi\r\n    &#145;alayhi&#146;l-salaam<\/i> by Raa&#146;id Sabri, 1\/176).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn Baaz said in <i>Majmoo&#146; al-Fataawa<\/i>,\r\n    3\/423-424):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;Ma&#146;aazif<\/i> refers to singing and musical instruments.\r\n    The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that at the end of time\r\n    there will come a people who will allow these things just as they will allow alcohol, zina\r\n    and silk. This is one of the signs of his Prophethood, for all of this has happened. The\r\n    hadeeth indicates that [musical instruments] are haraam, and condemns those who say they\r\n    are halaal, just as it condemns those who say that alcohol and zina are allowed. The\r\n    aayaat and ahaadeeth that warn against singing and musical instruments are many indeed.\r\n    Whoever claims that Allaah has allowed singing and musical instruments is lying and is\r\n    committing a great evil. We ask Allaah to keep us from obeying our desires and the\r\n    Shaytaan. Even worse and more seriously sinful than that are those who say it is\r\n    mustahabb. Undoubtedly this stems from ignorance about Allaah and His Religion; it is\r\n    insolent blasphemy against Allaah and lying about His Laws. What is mustahabb is to beat\r\n    on the daff [simple hand drum] at weddings. This is mustahabb for women only, in order to\r\n    announce the wedding and to distinguish it from fornication. There is nothing wrong with\r\n    women singing amongst themselves, accompanied by the daff, so long as the songs contain no\r\n    words that encourage evil or distract people from their duties. It is also a condition\r\n    that this should take place among women only, and there should be no mixing with men. It\r\n    should also not cause any annoyance or disturbance to neighbours. What some people do, of\r\n    amplifying such singing with loudspeakers is evil, because of the disturbance it causes to\r\n    other Muslims, neighbours and others. It is not permissible for women, in weddings or on\r\n    other occasions, to use any instrument other than the daff, such as the oud, violin, rebab\r\n    (stringed instrument) and so on. This is evil, and the only concession that women are\r\n    given is that they may use the daff.<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for men, it is not permissible for them to play any kind of musical\r\n    instrument, whether at weddings or on any other occasion. What Allaah has prescribed for\r\n    men is training in the use of instruments of war, such as target practice or learning to\r\n    ride horses and competing in that, using spears, shields, tanks, airplanes and other\r\n    things such as cannons, machine guns, bombs and anything else that may help jihaad for the\r\n    sake of Allaah.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam said in <i>al-Fataawa<\/i> (11\/569):<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;I know that in the &#145;golden age&#146;, the first and best\r\n    three centuries, in the Hijaaz, in Syria, in the Yemen, in Egypt, in the Maghreb, in Iraq,\r\n    in Khorasan, none of the religious and righteous people, the ascetics and those who\r\n    worshipped Allaah much, would gather to listen to this whistling and clapping and\r\n    drum-beating and so on. This was innovated after that at the end of the second century,\r\n    and whenever the imaams saw it, they denounced it.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for these anaasheed which are described as &#147;Islamic&#148; but\r\n    are accompanied with musical instruments, giving them this name lends them some measure of\r\n    legitimacy, but in fact they are singing and music, so calling them Islamic nasheeds is\r\n    falsehood and deception. They cannot be a substitute for singing, as an evil thing cannot\r\n    be substituted for another evil thing. We should replace something evil with something\r\n    good. Listening to it on the grounds that it is Islamic and an act of worship is\r\n    bid&#146;ah, and Allaah does not allow this. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.<\/p>\r\n    <p>For more information, see:<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>Talbees Iblees<\/i> (237) and <i>al-Madkhil<\/i> by Ibn al-Haaj\r\n    (3\/109); <i>al-Amr bi&#146;l-Ittibaa&#146; wa&#146;l-Nahy &#145;an al-Ibtidaa&#146;<\/i> by\r\n    al-Suyooti (99 ff); <i>Dham al-Malaahi<\/i> by Ibn Abi&#146;l-Dunya; <i>al-I&#146;laam\r\n    bi-anna al-&#145;Azif haraam<\/i> by Abu Bakr al-Jazaa&#146;iri; <i>Tanzeeh\r\n    al-Sharee&#146;ah &#145;an al-Aghaani al-Khalee&#146;ah wa Tahreem Aalaat al-Tarab<\/i> by\r\n    al-Albaani.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"8974","question_id":"8974","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      If singing is accompanied by musical instruments then it is \r\n      haraam to do it or to listen to it, whether it is done by a man or a \r\n      woman.

Whereas nasheeds used to have meanings of faith, jihad \r\n    and knowledge, they have now &ndash; in many cases &ndash; become akin to the songs of \r\n    evildoers, with softening of the voice, putting a picture of the munshid on \r\n    the cover of the tape, and making video clips to accompany the nasheed, \r\n    which contain haraam things such as the presence of women or evildoers, and \r\n    using musical instruments. The best of them nowadays are those that use \r\n    sound effects that mimic the sound of musical instruments. No attention is \r\n    paid to the meaning, rather all the attention is focused on the tune and \r\n    other sound effects. Otherwise tell me how a munshid can produce a nasheed \r\n    in English which the [Arab] listeners enjoy listening to so much even \r\n    though&nbsp; they do not understand a single word of it?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Nasheeds have overtaken other kinds of educational and \r\n    beneficial audio material and nasheed groups have proliferated in the Muslim \r\n    world. These groups do not hesitate to publish pictures of their groups in \r\n    newspapers and magazines wearing identical clothing, and their faces often \r\n    proclaim their going against the guidance of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), as they have shaved their beards. Some \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan readers whom Allaah has blessed with beautiful voices and talent in \r\n    reading that makes one weep have followed in their footsteps. Some of them \r\n    became very keen to go down that path and released some recordings which do \r\n    not befit their status. So you may find one of them producing a recording \r\n    with some clean-shaven evildoers and pictures of women appearing in the \r\n    video clip with the nasheed. The camera zooms in on the face of the munshid \r\n    when he is looking his best and he stares soulfully into the camera and \r\n    behaves like a pop singer. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We are not exaggerating, and we are not talking about things \r\n    that do not happen. These munshids who publish their pictures and mobile \r\n    phone numbers know that women are tempted by them, and they know what effect \r\n    their movements and looks and images have on that weak section of mankind. \r\n    Unfortunately we only see them producing more of these nasheeds with \r\n    images.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence some of the prominent Shaykhs who permitted nasheeds at \r\n    first were upset by what nasheeds and munshids have become &ndash; and this was \r\n    before they found out about the video clips &ndash; so they retracted the view \r\n    that it is permissible or they stipulated conditions for it to be said to be \r\n    permissible. Among these prominent Shaykhs are: Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>He said (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him):<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I think that Islamic nasheeds have changed from what they \r\n    were before.

But if a \r\n    man comes to us and sings anaasheed that have a sound meaning, and which do \r\n    not include any nonsense, and uses his voice only with no musical \r\n    instruments, there is nothing wrong with that.

But then they changed and we began to hear a rhythm \r\n    that may have been a duff or it may have been something other than a duff, \r\n    and they began to choose performers with beautiful and enchanting voices, \r\n    then they changed further and began to be performed in the manner of haraam \r\n    songs. Hence we began to feel uneasy about them, and unable to issue fatwas \r\n    stating that they were permissible in all cases, or that they were forbidden \r\n    in all cases.

There is no reason why he \r\n    should not offer this advice at the beginning of every game that the company \r\n    produces, or by means of a sheet inserted in every game CD.

It will also draw attention to the suitable age groups for each game, as \r\n    it is well known that games that are suited for adults are not suitable for \r\n    young children, and vice versa. So it is essential for each age group to \r\n    stick to that which is suitable.

As for indecent channels, the situation is obviously clear.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) warned \r\n    against bringing this equipment into the home in one of his khutbahs, where \r\n    he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We spoke about the [satellite] dish two weeks ago and we \r\n    explained the danger that it poses to a person during his life and after his \r\n    death. Many people were surprised that the warning was so stern. But we will \r\n    pose some questions, by answering which we will reach a conclusion. We \r\n    should ask about the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;There is no person whom Allaah appoints in charge of \r\n    people&rsquo;s affairs and he dies neglecting them, but Allaah will forbid \r\n    Paradise to him.&rdquo; Is this hadeeth saheeh? Yes, it is saheeh and is proven in\r\n    <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i>, <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> and elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is a man the shepherd of his family or not? The answer is \r\n    yes, he is the shepherd of his family. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) appointed him as such when he said: &ldquo;The man is the \r\n    shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock.&rdquo; This may also be \r\n    understood from the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families \r\n    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Tahreem 66:6]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second question is: If a man installs a dish for his \r\n    family and sees the great evils and things that go against sound morals, is \r\n    he neglecting them or being sincere towards them?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I believe that we would all respond by saying that he is \r\n    undoubtedly neglecting them, because this is going against the words of \r\n    Allaah, &ldquo;<i> you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against \r\n    a Fire&hellip;<\/i>&rdquo;, and because watching the things that we hear of is a cause of \r\n    moral decline. And if morals decline, religious commitment and belief \r\n    (&lsquo;aqeedah) will decline too. Nations rise and fall according to their degree \r\n    of morality, and as this is the case, if he dies with this dish in his \r\n    house, he will be counted as neglecting the flock in charge of whom Allah \r\n    appointed him by the words of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). So there is no way out other than removing \r\n    this dish from the home altogether. In our previous khutbah we explained \r\n    that it is not permissible to sell it, because if it is sold it will be used \r\n    for disobedience towards Allaah, so that will come under the heading of \r\n    helping others to disobey Allaah. In that case there is no better way to \r\n    discharge one's duty than breaking it, and Allaah will compensate him for \r\n    that. Do you not see that the Prophet of Allaah Sulaymaan (peace be upon \r\n    him) had <i>&ldquo; displayed before him, in the afternoon, well trained horses of \r\n    the highest breed&rdquo; [Saad 38:36]<\/i>, and they distracted him from \r\n    remembering Allaah until the sun had set. Then he called for them and began \r\n    to strike their necks and feet, because they had distracted him from the \r\n    remembrance of Allaah. So he killed them lest they distract him again, The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was given a fine, \r\n    printed garment (khameesah) and he put it on, but whilst he was praying he \r\n    looked at it once, and when he said the salaam he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Take this khameesah of mine and give it to Abu \r\n    Jahm, and bring me his plain garment.&rdquo; Abu Jahm was the one who had given it \r\n    to him, and he did not want to hurt his feelings, so he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, explaining why he was doing that: &ldquo;It \r\n    distracted me from my prayer just now.&rdquo; This indicates that if a man sees \r\n    something in his possessions that will distract him from remembrance of \r\n    Allaah or cause him to disobey Allaah, he should get rid of it altogether. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I repeat once again: some people understood from what I said \r\n    before that if a person dies with a dish in his house, that he will be one \r\n    of the people of Hell, but this is a misunderstanding, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only said: &ldquo;Allaah will \r\n    deprive him of Paradise&rdquo;. This is a warning which is to be understood in the \r\n    light of what it says in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, that if a man commits a sin \r\n    but he has faith in his heart, then he will not abide in Hell forever, \r\n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set \r\n    up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to \r\n    whom He wills&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:48]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But I was pleased that one of the people who heard my \r\n    previous khutbah &ndash; may Allaah bless him and reward him with good &ndash; went and \r\n    broke the dish that he had and destroyed it completely. He will find the joy \r\n    of that in his heart, because this is a sign of complete faith. When a woman \r\n    came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing \r\n    two heavy bracelets of gold on her arm, he said: &ldquo;Do you pay zakaah on \r\n    these?&rdquo; She said: No. He said: &ldquo;Would you like Allaah to give you two \r\n    bracelets of fire instead of them?&rdquo; She took them off and gave them to the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: They are \r\n    for Allaah and His Messenger. When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) saw a man with a gold ring on his finger, he said: \r\n    &ldquo;Would one of you go to a burning ember and put it in his hand &ndash; or on his \r\n    finger?&rdquo; Then the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    took the ring and threw it aside. Then it was said to the man, after the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had gone away: Take \r\n    your ring and benefit from it (by selling it). He said: By Allaah, I will \r\n    not pick up a ring that the Prophet SAW threw away. Think about how the \r\n    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) were and how they hastened to \r\n    give up that which was forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger. Hence they \r\n    were the most perfect of this ummah in faith, and they were the best of \r\n    generations, as it was narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best of people are my generation, then \r\n    those who come after them, then those who come after them.

If he is truly wise he will break it so that his home \r\n    will be free of these haraam things, and so that he will die being sincere \r\n    towards his family, in sha Allaah.

They forget that they, like anyone else who is accountable, \r\n    should hasten to do good deeds and fill their pages with hasanaat.

It has been \r\n          said that they are of Chinese or Indian origin, or otherwise. But historians \r\n          are agreed that they came to Europe from the Middle East in the latter \r\n          part of the Middle Ages. Experts also say that there is agreement that \r\n          playing cards have clearly evolved from that time until now.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Playing cards made their first appearance in Europe in \r\n          Andalusia, and were brought to northern Spain in the eleventh century \r\n          CE.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The traditional deck of cards in Spain consisted of 40 \r\n          cards, including the numbers 1 to 7, plus three characters, the highest \r\n          of which was the &ldquo;ruler&rdquo;, followed by the &ldquo;deputy&rdquo;, then the &ldquo;scribe&rdquo; \r\n          or &ldquo;knight.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          In the sixteenth century, the French changed the cards, \r\n          replacing the &ldquo;ruler&rdquo; with the king, the &ldquo;deputy&rdquo; with the queen, and \r\n          the &ldquo;knight&rdquo; with the jack. They also added three new numbers, so that \r\n          the deck now consisted of 52 cards. In the seventeenth century, the \r\n          Germans added a fourth character, the joker.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          We have quoted above the fatwa on playing with these \r\n          cards. It may also be added that playing cards is devoid of any of the \r\n          goals of recreational activities as required in Islam; it does not teach \r\n          any skill that is needed for jihad or any useful knowledge or bring \r\n          any social benefit or relaxation that will calm the nerves. Rather it \r\n          is a game that has nothing good in it; it causes arguments and simply \r\n          kills time. It is based on speculation and chance, and it is like playing \r\n          with dice, in that it leads to disputes and fighting, and it is like \r\n          alcohol and gambling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Based on the above, it would not be farfetched to suggest \r\n          that it is haraam rather than makrooh, by analogy with dice, because \r\n          both are based on chance and both lead to arguments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The same view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, \r\n          and it is the view of our contemporary scholars, and of Shaykh Muhammad \r\n          ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen among the fuqaha&rsquo; of al-Najd, who transmitted \r\n          it from his shaykhs. This is based on the fact that it leads to enmity \r\n          and hatred, and because it is a great waste of time and it distracts \r\n          people from remembering Allaah (dhikr) and keeps them from worshipping \r\n          and obeying Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          This view is further supported by the fact that one of \r\n          the French kings issued orders banning people from playing cards during \r\n          the day, and stating that everyone who went against this order was to \r\n          be arrested and punished. That was because the French people loved playing \r\n          cards too much, to such an extent that they were neglecting their work \r\n          in order to play cards. The punishment dictated by this French king \r\n          was not just a brief imprisonment, he also added a severe beating as \r\n          a deterrent to others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Yet \r\n          despite these decrees and others, he did not succeed in uprooting the \r\n          habit of playing cards; the only result was that the people started \r\n          to play in secret rather than openly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>From <i>Qadaaya al-Lahw wa&rsquo;l-Tarfeeh<\/i> by Maadoon Rasheed, p. 185-187. <\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"9000","question_id":"9000","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise \r\n          be to Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Parties should not be mixed; it is necessary \r\n          for there to be parties for men only and parties for women only.
