It is not the characteristic of the Muslim to look for the wealth \r\n    that is in other people&rsquo;s hands, let alone take it unlawfully. If a Muslim \r\n    is living in a non-Islamic state, then it is even more necessary for him to \r\n    refrain from taking their wealth, and he should not humiliate himself by \r\n    seeking the help that these countries offer to those who are unemployed, as \r\n    working hard and striving to earn a living is better&nbsp; for him than \r\n    humiliating himself. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi \r\n    narrated in <i>Tareekh Baghdaad <\/i>(10\/160) that &lsquo;Ali ibn al-Fudayl said: I \r\n    heard my father say to Ibn al-Mubaarak: You enjoin asceticism upon us, and \r\n    making do with little, but we see you bringing goods from Khorasaan to the \r\n    land of al-Haraam [Makkah]. How is that? Ibn al-Mubaarak said: O Abu &lsquo;Ali, I \r\n    only do that to protect my dignity and my honour, and I seek help thereby to \r\n    obey my Lord. I do not see any duty to Allaah but I hasten to do it. \r\n    al-Fudayl said to him: O Ibn al-Mubaarak, how good it is if you do this!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to taking help \r\n    (benefits) from the government &ndash; whether it is Muslim or not &ndash; when you are \r\n    not entitled to it and you do not meet the conditions stipulated, that is \r\n    haraam wealth and you must avoid it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah has commanded us to \r\n    fulfil covenants and promises, even with the disbelievers.

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No \r\n    man&rsquo;s wealth is permissible unless he gives it willingly.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    Ahmad, 20172; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&lsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    7662.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you have to correct you a mistake and repent from this sin \r\n    and from consuming unlawful wealth, and you have to return this two thousand \r\n    to your friend. There is nothing wrong with saying something ambiguous \r\n    without bluntly telling him that you lied to him; rather you may say that \r\n    the bank employee did not take it, for example. If he decides to give it or \r\n    some of it to you, then there is nothing wrong in accepting it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is stipulated that this loan should be a shar&lsquo;i loan which \r\n    does not involve any interest or penalties for late payment, otherwise it is \r\n    a riba-based loan which it is not permissible to take or to act as an \r\n    intermediary in order to obtain it, for yourself or for the bank employee, \r\n    because that involves helping one another in the major sin of riba, for \r\n    which the one who does it is cursed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10011","question_id":"10011","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Passing a verdict on a accused person whose case has been \r\n    brought to court and stating whether he is guilty or not guilty is regarded \r\n    as ruling and passing judgement.

If the matter is unclear and it is possible \r\n    to use it in both halaal and haraam ways, then it is permissible to sell it, \r\n    because there is no impediment to selling it, and uncertainty without \r\n    knowing what is more likely to be the case is not to be paid attention to.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he said, after mentioning the evidence for what he \r\n    stated:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up, if it seems most likely that it will be used in \r\n    ways that are not allowed, which is the haraam benefit, it is not \r\n    permissible to sell it. The fact that it is most likely to be used in a \r\n    haraam way should make the seller think that the purchaser is only buying \r\n    that item for that haraam usage. But if that is not the case, then the \r\n    matter is as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of that is selling grapes and dates to one who it \r\n    is thought most likely will use them to make khamr, or selling musical \r\n    instruments, which are only used for haraam purposes. In that case it is not \r\n    permissible to sell them, because that usage is haraam, and whatever it \r\n    haraam, it is haraam to sell it.

But anyone who examines what I have written of these <i>\r\n    Maqaamaat<\/i> will realise that they are beneficial and that they tell \r\n    stories about animate beings and inanimate things.&nbsp; No one has ever heard of \r\n    anyone who rejected such stories or regarded their writers as sinners at \r\n    all. If deeds are but by intentions, then what is wrong with one who writes \r\n    stories, intending thereby to highlight some issues, for the purpose of \r\n    promoting good morals, and his intention was never to tell lies? Isn&rsquo;t he, \r\n    in that case, like a teacher who teaches good manners and guides people to \r\n    the straight path?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Maqaamaat al-Hareeri<\/i>, p. 17, 18&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad Rasheed Rida (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    commented by noting: He says that he never heard of anyone among the \r\n    scholars of the ummah up to his time forbidding such stories which speak of \r\n    animals, such as <i>Kaleelah wa Dimnah<\/i>, and so on, because the intention \r\n    behind them was to exhort and teach something good. And we have never heard \r\n    of any of the scholars after his time saying that it is haraam to read his\r\n    <i>Maqaamaat<\/i>. But some popular figures came up with this view and had \r\n    the audacity to declare haraam that which Allah and His Messenger did not \r\n    prohibit, and which none of the scholars of Islam declared to be haraam.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majallat al-Minaar<\/i>, 14\/828-830, in a \r\n    fatwa entitled <i>Tamtheel al-Waqaa&rsquo;i&lsquo; at-Taareekhiyyah wa&rsquo;l-Khayaaliyyah \r\n    li&rsquo;l-I&lsquo;tibaar<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They should have sublime aims and great meanings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked: Some literary authors write stories that teach \r\n    moral lessons in a very attractive style, which have a great impact on \r\n    readers&rsquo; hearts, but it is all imaginary. What is the ruling on that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with \r\n    that if it deals with spiritual or moral or social problems, because there \r\n    is nothing wrong with giving likenesses by telling fictional stories. In \r\n    fact some of the scholars have stated that some of the likenesses given in \r\n    the Holy Qur&rsquo;an did not refer to real events; rather Allah gave these as \r\n    examples (to teach a lesson), such as when He, may He be exalted, said \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>And Allah puts \r\n    forward (another) example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power \r\n    over anything (disbeliever), and he is a burden to his master, whichever way \r\n    he directs him, he brings no good.

Islam came to \r\n    establish these rights and to make each spouse adhere to them, as Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And they \r\n    (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar \r\n    (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to \r\n    what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    [al-Baqarah 2:228]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The rights \r\n    of each spouse are matched by duties that they owe to the other. This \r\n    achieves balance between them, which leads to stability in family life. Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said concerning this verse: This \r\n    means that women are entitled to kind and decent treatment from their \r\n    husbands, just as they are required to obey them in matters in which they \r\n    are enjoined to obey their husbands. Al-Qurtubi said: The verse includes all \r\n    marriage rights and duties.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>These duties \r\n    include overlooking insignificant matters and mistakes, especially words and \r\n    actions by which no harm was meant. According to the hadeeth of Anas (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Every son of Adam is prone to error, and the best of \r\n    those who err are those who repent.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2499); classed \r\n    as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Both husband \r\n    and wife have to put up with one another, for everyone makes mistakes and \r\n    the one who deserves most tolerance is the one who is with you most of the \r\n    time. Neither party should respond in kind if the other is angry. If one \r\n    spouse sees the other being irritable, he should restrain his anger and not \r\n    respond directly to the irritation. Hence Abu&rsquo;l-Darda&rsquo; (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said to his wife: &ldquo;If you see me angry, try to calm me \r\n    down and if I see you angry I will try to calm you down, otherwise we cannot \r\n    live together.&rdquo; The Imam of Ahl al-Sunnah, Imam Ahmad, (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) married &lsquo;Abaasah bint al-Mufaddal, the mother of his child \r\n    Saalih, and he used to say of her: &ldquo;Umm Saalih stayed with me for twenty \r\n    years, and we never differed concerning anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of the \r\n    greatest duties is that each spouse should advise the other to fear Allaah. \r\n    In a saheeh hadeeth it is narrated that Thawbaan said: &ldquo;When the verse <i>\r\n    &lsquo;And those who hoard up gold and silver&rsquo; [al-Tawbah 9:34]<\/i> was revealed, \r\n    we were with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on \r\n    one of his journeys, and some of his companions said: &lsquo;There has been \r\n    revealed concerning gold and silver what has been revealed; if we knew what \r\n    kind of wealth is better we would seek it.&rsquo; He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;The best of it is a tongue that remembers Allaah, \r\n    a heart that is grateful and a believing wife who helps him in his faith.&rsquo;&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (21358) and al-Tirmidhi (3094). It is also narrated in <i>\r\n    Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i> (5231).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover a \r\n    man should not hate his wife if he sees in her something that he dislikes, \r\n    because if he dislikes one characteristic in her, he will be pleased with \r\n    another, so the one will make up for the other. According to the hadeeth, \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Let not \r\n    a believing man hate a believing woman; if he dislikes one characteristic in \r\n    her he will be pleased with another.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim (1469).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of the \r\n    greatest things that will help to create a good relationship between spouses \r\n    is a good attitude. Hence Islam attaches great importance to it. It was \r\n    narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The most perfect of \r\n    the believers in faith are those who are best in attitude, and the best of \r\n    you are those who are best to their womenfolk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi \r\n    (1162); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Part of kind \r\n    treatment is forbearance, not following up on all matters, small or great, \r\n    and not rebuking or scolding for everything, except with regard to the \r\n    rights of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fact \r\n    that your wife left the house without your permission and has been away for \r\n    so long, does not mean that she is divorced, rather she is still your wife, \r\n    and she is not divorced unless you divorce her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But this \r\n    leaving is counted as nushooz (wilful defiance) and she is sinning thereby, \r\n    and she forfeits her right to maintenance, so long as she has no excuse for \r\n    leaving, such as any harm or wrongdoing that you may have done to her. But \r\n    her continuing to stay away from the home for this length of time, and her \r\n    keeping away from her husband and children, are a sin that cannot be \r\n    approved of, and her family should not help her in that. This staying away \r\n    is one of the greatest means that the Shaytaan will use to destroy the \r\n    household and create enmity. Hence a wise man, and a family that understands \r\n    the consequences, will not approve of this staying away, rather they will \r\n    strive to bring people together, discuss the matter and solve the problem in \r\n    an atmosphere of kindness and love, so as to preserve the respect and love \r\n    between the spouses.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence our \r\n    advice to you is to get in touch with your wife, and admonish her and remind \r\n    her of Allaah and of her duties towards her husband and children. If this \r\n    advice does not succeed, then seek the help of good and righteous people \r\n    among her relatives and others whom you know.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Our advice \r\n    to the wife is to fear Allaah and beware of disobeying her husband and \r\n    making him angry, and giving her family precedence over the interests of her \r\n    home and children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Both spouses \r\n    should realize that stubbornly clinging to their own opinions will not solve \r\n    the problem that exists between them, rather it will only make it worse. The \r\n    one who is big hearted is the one who hastens to reconcile, and understands \r\n    the importance of reconciliation. So be the big hearted one, and let that \r\n    motivate you to seek an understanding and a solution to the problem. That \r\n    will only raise you in status before Allaah, may He be exalted, and before \r\n    His creation. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Allaah only increases a person in status if he forgives, and no one \r\n    ever humbles himself before Allaah but Allaah will raise him in status.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Muslim (2588).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So hasten to \r\n    get in touch and ask after her.

This is the view of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, &lsquo;Ata&rsquo;, Qataadah, al-Thawri, Ishaaq \r\n    and Abu Thawr, and it is one of the two views of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i&hellip; because of the \r\n    hadeeth of Salamah ibn Sakhar, who said: &ldquo;I have separated from my wife by \r\n    zihaar until the month of Ramadaan is over.&rdquo; But he told the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he had had intercourse with \r\n    her during that month, and he told him to offer the expiation, but he did \r\n    not rebuke him for setting a time limit.

Allaah has made the wife a covering for her \r\n    husband and has made the husband a covering for his wife. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan \r\n    (i.e. <span>you enjoy the pleasure of living \r\n    with them<\/span>)] for you and you are the same for them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:187]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon some spouses is \r\n    that He creates love and compassion between them, and helps each of them to \r\n    do that which causes harmony to grow in the family and ward off disputes and \r\n    arguments. This is a very great blessing indeed, which is not appreciated by \r\n    anyone but those whose family relationships are disrupted and disputes and \r\n    arguments arise amongst them, which turn the marital relationship into an \r\n    unbearable hell. If that happens, each spouse starts to dream of a stable \r\n    family life, and the man wishes for a wife with whom he can live in peace, \r\n    and the wife wishes for a man with whom she can live in peace.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From your question, it may be understood that Allaah has \r\n    bestowed all these blessings upon you, so what you should do is be grateful \r\n    to Allaah for this great blessing and strive to preserve it and the family \r\n    with which Allaah has blessed you, for millions of women wish that they \r\n    could be in the good situation in which you are, but you do not appreciate \r\n    its value.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should note that it is not permissible for a woman to \r\n    form a relationship with a non-mahram man. If she is married, then such a \r\n    relationship is even more haraam, because it is a transgression against the \r\n    husband&rsquo;s rights and honour.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, it is not permissible for you and this evil \r\n    lover to pray istikhaarah, because istikhaarah is only prescribed in cases \r\n    where it is not clear if the matter is good or bad, and the Muslim does not \r\n    know where his interests lie, so he prays istikhaarah asking that Allaah \r\n    will help him to attain that which is good if it is good, or divert it from \r\n    him if it is bad. But if a Muslim prays istikhaarah with regard to \r\n    disobeying Allaah or going against His commands, this is a sin for which he \r\n    has to repent to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To explain further: if a Muslim woman prays istikhaarah about \r\n    marrying someone other than her husband when she is still married to her \r\n    husband, then in fact she is praying istikhaarah about wrecking her home and \r\n    family, and praying istikhaarah about hurting her children, and praying \r\n    istikhaarah about divorcing a husband who is treating her well and taking \r\n    good care of her. So she is praying istikhaarah about betraying him and \r\n    stabbing him in the back by tearing apart his family, so that his home and \r\n    hers will be destroyed at her hands. She is praying istikhaarah about \r\n    responding to great kindness and good treatment with a great wrong and \r\n    denying the rights of one who has treated her well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of these factors and many others apply to the istikhaarah \r\n    prayer that you offered.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the positive result that you say your friend got, \r\n    undoubtedly this is a case of the shaytaan making following one's whims and \r\n    desires appear attractive. The Muslim should not pray istikhaarah about \r\n    doing something that is haraam, so how can he pray istikhaarah and claim \r\n    that he got a positive result?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, after praying istikhaarah the Muslim should resolve \r\n    firmly either to do it or not to do it. Whatever Allaah makes easy for him \r\n    is what is good, but if he waits until he feels good about it or sees a \r\n    dream and the like, these are usually illusionary matters on which no shar&rsquo;i \r\n    ruling can be based.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, you should push away all whispers from \r\n    the shaytaan that have to do with this matter, and do not give evil any way \r\n    of reaching you or your family or children. You should realize that you have \r\n    fallen into a trap of the shaytaan, because he has made you attractive to \r\n    this young man and has made him attractive to you so that he may achieve \r\n    what is his greatest dream, namely the destruction of a stable, believing \r\n    Muslim family and the divorce of two spouses who love one another, and the \r\n    neglect of their children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thwart the plans of the shaytaan by not letting this young \r\n    man destroy your life and your family. Cut off all means that may enable him \r\n    to continue to have any place in your life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the ways in which you can ward off these devilish \r\n    whispers is to ask yourself the following questions and answer them \r\n    honestly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If this young man is righteous, \r\n    then how can he accept to destroy the home of his Muslim brother and split \r\n    up his family? <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If this person really loves \r\n    you, why is he striving to wreck your home and destroy your family?

It \r\n    should be noted that many marriages that are based on &ldquo;love&rdquo; are doomed to \r\n    failure after only a few months, because they are based on a weak \r\n    foundation, not on a foundation of pleasing Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Do you expect that trust will \r\n    last between you after you get married?

Al-Zuhri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    Whoever makes a promise to Allaah then breaks it, must give in charity that \r\n    which Allaah has enjoined in the case of a broken oath.

Whoever cannot do that must fast for three \r\n    days, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in \r\n    your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its \r\n    expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale \r\n    of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them \r\n    or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast \r\n    for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And \r\n    protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much).

Many minor differences can be dealt with and an understanding \r\n    can be reached. It may need some time in order to get used to one another \r\n    and become comfortable with one another. But the most important matter is \r\n    his relationship with his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and his \r\n    adherence to his religion.

Hence the way to deal with it is to be \r\n    frank about it, in a way that will not hurt his feelings or spoil his \r\n    enjoyment. Perhaps as time goes by you will find an opportunity to tell him, \r\n    in an appropriate manner, so that you will not be forced to resort to \r\n    something haraam and you will be able to enjoy that which Allaah has \r\n    permitted for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It may be due to the nature of the husband or wife, in \r\n    terms of strength or weakness of desire.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

Look at the etiquette \r\n    that was observed in the household of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) and how the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them) transmitted the details of his life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following was narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Kurayb the freed slave of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Abbaas that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas told him that he stayed overnight \r\n    with Maymoonah, the wife of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him), who was his maternal aunt. He said: I lay my head on the end \r\n    of the pillow and the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) and his wife placed their heads on its side. The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) slept \r\n    until midnight, or shortly before or after, then the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) woke and started to rub the \r\n    sleep from his eyes with his hands. Then he recited the last ten verses of \r\n    Aal &lsquo;Imraan&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4571; Muslim, 763.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This indicates \r\n    that it is permissible for a man to sleep alongside his wife without being \r\n    intimate with her in the presence of one of her mahrams, even if he has \r\n    reached the age of discernment. Al-Qaadi said: In some versions of this \r\n    hadeeth it says: Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt \r\n    one night when she was menstruating. Even though the isnaad of this version \r\n    is not saheeh, it contains a very interesting idea, because Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas \r\n    would not have asked to stay overnight on a night when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may have wanted to be intimate \r\n    with his wife, and his father would not have sent him there unless he knew \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have \r\n    no need to be intimate with his wife &ndash; because it is well known that he \r\n    would not have been intimate with her when Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas was there sharing the \r\n    same pillow with them and he was watching to see what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, and he did not sleep or he \r\n    only slept a little.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i>, 6\/46&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In addition, doing such things openly is an action that is \r\n    contrary to honour and decency.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Maawardi said: Honour \r\n    and decency means making sure that one&rsquo;s deeds befit the circumstances so \r\n    that no deeds may appear abhorrent or blameworthy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Adab al-Dunya wa&rsquo;l-Deen<\/i>, 392.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The negative effects that such behaviour has on the \r\n    children&rsquo;s upbringing is sufficient reason not to do it, for children are \r\n    created with the natural instinct to imitate their parents in all their \r\n    affairs. So there is the fear that one of them may try to do that out of \r\n    ignorance and a lack of understanding of what he is doing, and this is bad \r\n    enough. Moreover there is no guarantee that small children talk to others \r\n    about what they have seen, and it is obvious that this will cause \r\n    embarrassment and loss of geerah (protective jealousy)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: If the affection that the husband and wife show in \r\n    front of the children is of the kind that is usually shown, namely \r\n    compassion, kindness and care, which will fill the house with peace and \r\n    respect and happiness, especially on occasions such as Eid etc, that is \r\n    permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Showing that kind of affection will have an effect on the children&rsquo;s peace of mind and will make them sense that there is mutual understanding and harmony in their family. There is nothing wrong with showing that kind of affection, but only as much as is necessary and without doing anything that is forbidden.

But we will try to suggest to \r\n    you the best ways of dealing with it, in sha Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    First of all, you are to be commended for guarding your \r\n    married life and for your chastity and patience for such a long time. We \r\n    admire and respect you for your understanding and your keenness that your \r\n    marriage should continue.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Seek reward with Allaah, for Allaah tests His slaves to see \r\n    which of them will be patient, and He raises their status when they are \r\n    patient, and gives them a way out. This is one of the main ways of dealing \r\n    with such situations, and is indeed the most important way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now we will discuss the matter step by step.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    First of all you mention that when you call your husband, he \r\n    gives the excuse that he is tired.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Have you tried to talk to him about this matter? If you \r\n    talk to him you will probably find out some things of which you were \r\n    unaware. Some men may be affected by impotence which makes them give excuses \r\n    to their wives, but they feel too embarrassed to explain the reason. Some of \r\n    them even try to avoid the issue and the only thing that can do is to resort \r\n    these bad magazines to prove to himself and to those around him that he is \r\n    still a man.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should sit with him and talk frankly, and explain to him \r\n    in a gentle and kind manner that you are his loving wife and that one of \r\n    your rights over him is that he should fulfil your desires &ndash; which Allaah \r\n    has created in you &ndash;, and that you would like to know the reason why, and \r\n    that this will increase your respect for him and will not affect your \r\n    married life or your opinion of him. A man always fears that he will \r\n    regarded as lacking somehow, especially in his wife&rsquo;s eyes. Perhaps he will \r\n    tell you other reasons and you can evaluate them according to what you know \r\n    about your married life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Perhaps you can also try writing a letter, discussing the \r\n    issue in a gentle and tactful manner, because this has also proven to be a \r\n    useful means which, by Allaah&rsquo;s grace, has helped to solve some problems, \r\n    especially when one of the parties has refused to talk or it is difficult to \r\n    discuss it with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Find out the ways to your husband&rsquo;s heart. Wear the kind \r\n    of clothes that he likes you to wear, put on some nice perfume of the kind \r\n    that he likes most, and try to change the daily routine and introduce \r\n    something new into your lives. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Tell him of your love and respect for him, through a \r\n    scented letter, beautiful words and other means. You could write some nice \r\n    words on the mirror, for example, or give him a gift with some words from \r\n    the heart written on it, which will tell him of your love for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; A smile charms all people, especially men. Look at him \r\n    with love and a heartfelt smile. Send him your love whilst looking at him, \r\n    without saying anything, as long as that comes from the depths of your \r\n    heart. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; Try to draw closer to your husband with the words and \r\n    actions that he loves, seeking thereby the pleasure of Allaah. If you find \r\n    that you have done all that you can, you can bring in a mediator whom you \r\n    know your husband trusts and who is wise and persuasive, without telling him \r\n    exactly what is going on between you, to hint to him and discuss the rights \r\n    and duties of marriage with him, without him telling your husband that you \r\n    have mentioned that to him or that you have asked him to intervene. But this \r\n    is subject to the condition that he should be a person who is known for his \r\n    good morals, upright nature and chastity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; You should call him, kindly, to give up that which angers \r\n    Allaah, such as these magazines, in an indirect manner; such leaving in a \r\n    place near where he sleeps a fatwa saying that this is not permissible, or \r\n    playing a tape with a lecture or lesson that may move him, or trying to \r\n    recite soorahs of the Qur&rsquo;aan near him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; I wish that you would banish the idea of separation from \r\n    your mind, and strive hard and be patient, so that you may attain a great \r\n    reward and a high status before Allaah, because if you leave him, you may \r\n    not necessarily find another suitable husband. Moreover, if you have \r\n    children, this makes it even more important for you to be patient, unless it \r\n    is impossible to be patient and you find that you have no other choice but \r\n    to leave, in which case you may do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9 &ndash; Take care of yourself and your own life and faith. \r\n    Strengthening your relationship with Allaah will make things easier for you \r\n    and will give you peace of mind and certain faith. Look to the future and be \r\n    certain that it will be better, so long as you remain close to Allaah. Ask \r\n    Him for that in your prayers constantly. If you can set aside some times \r\n    when you occupy yourself with good things or do some voluntary work for \r\n    charity or some da&rsquo;wah activities with some sisters, then these good deeds \r\n    will strengthen your personality and make it attractive. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10 &ndash; Distract yourself from thinking about your husband, if \r\n    only for a short while. Distract yourself with other things such as a simple \r\n    project or participating in some internet web sites to fill your time. \r\n    Remember to relax with some things that do not go against Islam so that you \r\n    can have the strength to carry on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, you have three &ldquo;keys&rdquo; at your disposal which will \r\n    help you in all your affairs by Allaah&rsquo;s leave:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. There is nothing that Allaah cannot do on earth \r\n    or in heaven.

Whoever is cautious in the dubious matters \r\n    will save his religious commitment and his honour, but whoever falls into \r\n    dubious matters will fall into haraam, like a shepherd who grazes his flocks \r\n    around a private pasture and is liable to enter it at any moment. Every king \r\n    has a sanctuary, and the sanctuary of Allaah is the things that He has \r\n    forbidden. In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the \r\n    entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be \r\n    corrupt. It is the heart.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslim, 4049.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; What Allaah has prescribed in the relationship between \r\n    husband and wife is sufficient and there is no need for anything else. \r\n    Allaah has not forbidden anything except that which is harmful.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The questioner should realize that in His complete wisdom, \r\n    when Allaah forbids something (in this case, intercourse in the back \r\n    passage), He also forbids the things that lead to it, because when a person \r\n    does the things that lead to a haraam action, his heart becomes attached to \r\n    it and finds himself torn between either doing the evil action or keeping \r\n    away from it, and suffering because of that. So he does not keep away from \r\n    haraam in such a way that he has peace of mind, nor does he fall into it and \r\n    fulfil the desires of his evil nafs.

Love does not need to be \r\n    renewed every year, rather it should be renewed all the time, every time the \r\n    woman sees something of her husband that makes her happy, and every time the \r\n    man sees something of his wife that makes him happy, then the love between \r\n    them will be renewed. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-&lsquo;Ulama&rsquo; fi &lsquo;Ushrat al-Nisa&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    p. 162.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10070","question_id":"10070","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with a woman calling her husband by \r\n    his name, because there is no evidence to indicate that that is not allowed. \r\n    But people&rsquo;s customs and traditions should be taken into account in this \r\n    matter.

What you have mentioned in your \r\n    question may be answered by noting the following :&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The modern kinds of washrooms in modern houses such as \r\n    those in your country differ greatly from the places used in the past for \r\n    relieving oneself, which were places where dirt, filth and impurities \r\n    collected. Modern washrooms are not like that, rather they can be kept clean \r\n    and there is no impurity in them. Therefore they are not like the places \r\n    that people used for relieving themselves in the past, and there are obvious \r\n    differences between them. On this basis there is no real reason why one \r\n    should not fulfil one's sexual desire in such places when necessary, in the \r\n    manner that you mentioned.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;2 &ndash; A man&rsquo;s fulfilling his sexual desire with his wife may \r\n    often happen as the result of stimulation, by looking or touching etc. Hence \r\n    fulfilling his desire when it is provoked in such situations is a means of \r\n    keeping himself chaste and lowering his gaze [from looking at other women]. \r\n    This is what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    taught us to do, according to the hadeeth narrated by Muslim (1403) from \r\n    Jaabir, who says that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) saw a woman and he came to his wife Zaynab, whilst she \r\n    was tanning a skin and preparing it for dyeing, and he fulfilled his need. \r\n    Then he went out to his companions and said: &ldquo;Woman comes and goes in the \r\n    shape of a devil [i.e., she causes temptation], so if any one of you sees a \r\n    woman, let him go and have intercourse with his wife, for that will take \r\n    away what he feels in his heart.&rdquo; This was also narrated by Ahmad, 19403; \r\n    Ibn Maajah, 1853. Ibn Hibbaan narrated in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, 4171, that \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Awfa said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;No woman fulfils all her duties \r\n    towards Allaah until she fulfils all her duties towards her husband. If he \r\n    asks her [for his conjugal rights] even when she is on the back of a camel, \r\n    she should respond to him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; At the same time, the Muslim should not forget, when his \r\n    desire is provoked, to bear in mind the intention of keeping chaste and of \r\n    enjoying that which is good and permissible. Then doing that will be an act \r\n    of charity and righteousness on his part, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;In the intimacy of any one of you \r\n    there is charity.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, if any one of us \r\n    fulfils his desire will there be reward for him in that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Do you \r\n    not see that if he does it in a haraam way, that will be a sin on him? So if \r\n    he does it in a halaal way, he will be rewarded for that.&rdquo; (Narrated by \r\n    Muslim, 1006, from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr). A man should also recite the \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; that was narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) for this situation. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When any one of you wants to have \r\n    intercourse with his wife, let him say: &lsquo;<i>Bismillaah, Allaahumma jannibna \r\n    al-Shaytaana wa jannib al-Shaytaana ma razaqtana<\/i> (In the name of Allaah, \r\n    O Allaah, keep the Shaytaan away from us and from that with which You may \r\n    bless us)&rsquo;, then if it is decreed that they should have a child from that, \r\n    the Shaytaan will never be able to harm him.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, \r\n    6388; Muslim, 1434, from the hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;May Allaah grant you strength and bless you.<\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Dr. &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab ibn Naasir al-Turaydi."},{"id":"10093","question_id":"10093","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    She does not have to give the money to her husband.

In that case he should realize that this is due \r\n          to his lack of knowledge and the shortcomings of human intellect, which \r\n          is not free of defects.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          When a man and a woman come together in marriage and \r\n          live together, there are bound to be differences in opinion between \r\n          them, and one party must have the final say in order to resolve the \r\n          issue, otherwise the differences will multiply and disputes will increase. \r\n          So there has to be someone in charge, otherwise the marriage will founder.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Hence Islam made the husband the protector and maintainer \r\n          of the wife and gave him the responsibility of heading the household, \r\n          because he is more perfect in rational thinking than her in most cases. \r\n          This means that it is obligatory for her to obey him. Allaah says (interpretation \r\n          of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &ldquo;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has \r\n          made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support \r\n          them) from their means&rdquo; <i>[al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:34]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Among the reasons for that are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1 &ndash; Men are more able to bear this responsibility, just \r\n          as women are more able than men to take care of the children and the \r\n          household affairs. So each of them has his or her natural role and position.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; In Islam, men are obliged to spend on their wives; \r\n          the wife does not have to work or earn a living. Even if she has an \r\n          independent income or she becomes rich, the husband is still obliged \r\n          to spend on her as much as she needs. Because he bears the responsibility \r\n          of spending, he is made the protector and maintainer of his wife and \r\n          is put in charge (of the household).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Hence we see chaos in the societies which go against \r\n          that: men do not shoulder the responsibility of spending on their wives, \r\n          and wives are not obliged to obey their husbands; they go out of the \r\n          home whenever they want and leave the marital nest empty and neglect \r\n          their children. A woman has to work hard even if that is at the expense \r\n          of her house and family.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          We should also take note of the following points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1 &ndash; The woman will be rewarded by Allaah for her obedience \r\n          to her husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; This obedience should not involve disobeying Allaah. \r\n          The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no obedience \r\n          to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; Just as the husband has the right to be obeyed, Islam \r\n          also tells him to treat his wife kindly.

Now let us answer your question as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>If a father mistreats his son, does the son have the right to hit his\r\n      father? Why not?<\/p>\r\n      <p>If a mother mistreats her daughter, does the daughter have the right to\r\n      hit her mother? Why not?<\/p>\r\n      <p>If a teacher mistreats his student, does the student have the right to hit\r\n      his teacher? Why not?<\/p>\r\n      <p>If a commander mistreats a soldier, does the soldier have the right to hit\r\n      his commander? Why not?<\/p>\r\n    <\/blockquote>\r\n    <p>The answer in all the above cases is: No, and the reason for this is\r\n    clear. It is because the father&rsquo;s position is higher than that of his son, the\r\n    mother&rsquo;s position is higher than that of her daughter, and the teacher&rsquo;s\r\n    position is higher than that of the student. Hence it is not appropriate for the people in\r\n    the lower position to punish those whose position is higher. The same applies to husband\r\n    and wife: the husband is in charge of his wife, and she has to obey him and not go out\r\n    without his permission, otherwise the stability of the family will be destroyed. The\r\n    family should have just one leader to steer its course, and that leader is the one who\r\n    spends on the family and protects it. The husband is physically stronger and is more wise\r\n    than the wife. We can easily understand if he disciplines his wife when she does something\r\n    wrong, but we cannot imagine the wife hitting the husband if he is at fault. Would she hit\r\n    someone who is physically stronger than she is? Would she hit her leader and protector? At\r\n    the same time, the husband is not allowed to hit his wife for every little thing or as he\r\n    wishes. If she is at fault or is rebellious, he should first warn and advise her. If that\r\n    doesn&rsquo;t work, then he should withhold conjugal relations and not speak to her, until\r\n    she comes to her senses. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, then he is allowed to hit her, but not\r\n    in a painful fashion. This does not mean that her entire body is his to beat as he wishes\r\n    &ndash; no, and a thousand times no! Islam does not allow him to hit her severely or leave\r\n    bruises, or break her bones, or cause her to bleed, neither is he allowed to hit her on\r\n    the face (as you pointed out in your question). The hitting that is allowed is within\r\n    certain limits and is for the purpose of discipline, not for revenge or to vent one&rsquo;s\r\n    anger. If his wife responds and returns to obedience, he has no right to seek means of\r\n    annoyance against her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Men are the\r\n    protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the\r\n    other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous\r\n    women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the\r\n    husband&rsquo;s absence what Allaah order them to guard (e.g., their chastity, their\r\n    husband&rsquo;s property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you fear ill-conduct,\r\n    admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly,\r\n    if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of\r\n    annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great.&rdquo; <\/i>[al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:34]<\/p>\r\n    <p>If it is the husband who is mistreating his wife, that does not mean that\r\n    she should remain oppressed or that her hands are tied. She has the right &ndash; just as\r\n    the husband has &ndash; to warn and advise him, and to remind him to fear Allaah. If that\r\n    does not work, she can seek the help of wise people among his relatives and her own, and\r\n    they can advise him. If this does not work, then the matter can be taken to a qaadi\r\n    (Muslim judge) who can force him to do the right thing &ndash; and Allaah is above them\r\n    all.<\/p>\r\n    <p>When Islam differentiates between the sexes, it is in the interests of\r\n    both, and this is the essence of wisdom. Unlike a man, a woman does not have to pray and\r\n    fast when she has her period, out of consideration for her condition. <\/p>\r\n    <p>She does not have to spend on her husband, because he is stronger and more\r\n    able to earn a living. In return, she has to obey him and ask his permission before\r\n    leaving the house; the reverse does not apply. In the event of a separation, it is the\r\n    mother, and not the father, who has the right to custody of the children. And there are\r\n    other rulings which are based on an acknowledgment of the differences between the sexes.\r\n    Can we then say that this is oppression or unfair discrimination? No, by Allaah, this is\r\n    justice and wisdom, revealed by the Wise, All-Aware, All-Knowing, All-Seeing.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We hope that this explanation will make the true picture clearer for you.\r\n    Put aside the doubts and confusions of those who are ignorant and hate this religion, and\r\n    enter Islam in which there is justice, safety, security and happiness.

When you go to sleep, say &#145;<i>Subhaan-Allaah<\/i>\r\n      (Glory be to Allaah)&#146; thirty three times, &#145;<i>Al-Hamdu Lillaah<\/i> (praise be to\r\n      Allaah)&#146; thirty three times, and &#145;<i>Allaahu akbar<\/i> (Allaah is Most\r\n      Great)&#146; thirty four times.&#148; (<i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari bi Sharh\r\n      al-&#145;Asqallaani<\/i>, part 9\/506).<\/p>\r\n      <p>Al-Tabari said, in his commentary on this\r\n      hadeeth: we may understand from this hadeeth that every woman who is able to take care of\r\n      her house by making bread, grinding flour and so on, should do so. It is not the duty of\r\n      the husband if it is the custom for women like her to do this themselves.<\/p>\r\n      <p>What we learn from the hadeeth is that when Faatimah (may\r\n      Allaah be pleased with her) asked her father <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n      for a servant, he did not command her husband to find her a servant or hire someone to do\r\n      these tasks, or to do these tasks himself. If it were &#145;Ali&#146;s duty to do these\r\n      things, the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have commanded him\r\n      to do them.<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>The hadeeth of Asma&#146; bint Abi Bakr<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in\r\n      his <i>Saheeh<\/i> that Asma&#146; bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) said:\r\n      &#147;I got married to al-Zubayr, and he had no wealth on earth and no slaves, nothing\r\n      except a camel for bringing water and his horse. I used to feed his horse and bring water,\r\n      and I used to sew patches on the bucket. I made dough but I was not good at baking bread,\r\n      so my (female) neighbours among the Ansaar used to bake bread for me, and they were\r\n      sincere women. I used to bring date pits from al-Zubayr&#146;s land that the Messenger of\r\n      Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had given to him, carrying them on my\r\n      head. This land was two-thirds of a <i>farsakh<\/i> away. One day I came, carrying the date\r\n      pits on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n      him), who had a group of the Ansaar with him. He called me and made his camel kneel down,\r\n      for me to ride behind him, but I felt too shy to go with the men, and I remembered\r\n      al-Zubayr and his jealousy, for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of Allaah\r\n<img>\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) realized that I felt shy, so he moved on. I\r\n      came to al-Zubayr and told him, &#145;I met the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n      of Allaah be upon him) when I was carrying date pits on my head, and he had a group of his\r\n      companions with him. He made his camel kneel down for me to ride with him, but I\r\n      remembered your jealousy.&#146; He said, &#145;By Allaah, it bothers me more that you have\r\n      to carry the date pits than that you should ride with him.&#146;&#148; Asma&#146; said:\r\n      &#147;After that, Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse, and it was as if I\r\n      had been liberated from slavery.&#148; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, <i>Fath<\/i>,\r\n      9\/319).<\/p>\r\n      <p>In the commentary on the hadeeth of\r\n      Asma&#146;, it says: from this incident we may understand that it is the woman&#146;s duty\r\n      to take care of everything that her husband needs her to take care of. This was the\r\n      opinion of Abu Thawr. Other fuqaha&#146; suggested that Asma&#146; did this voluntarily\r\n      and that she was not obliged to do it.<\/p>\r\n      <p>Ibn Hajar al-&#145;Asqallaani said: &#147;It seems that this\r\n      incident &#150; Asma&#146; carrying the date pitss to help her husband &#150; and other\r\n      similar incidents were the matter of necessity, namely that her husband al-Zubayr and\r\n      other Muslim men were preoccupied with jihaad and other things that the Messenger of\r\n      Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had commanded them to do, and they did\r\n      not have time to take care of domestic matters themselves, and could not afford to hire\r\n      servants to do that for them, and there was no one else who could do that apart from their\r\n      womenfolk. So the women used to take care of the home and whoever lived in it, so that the\r\n      men could devote their time to supporting Islam.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <p>Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): &#147;What is\r\n      more likely is that the matter had to do with the customs in that land, for customs may\r\n      vary in this regard.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <p>It seems that what Ibn Hajar said is close to the view of\r\n      those who say that the wife has to take care of her husband and the home in accordance\r\n      with the dictates of local custom.<\/p>\r\n      <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said, concerning the story of Asma&#146;:\r\n      &#147;When the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Asma&#146; with\r\n      the date pits on her head, and her husband al-Zubayr was with her, he did not tell him\r\n      that she did not have to serve him, or that this was unfair to her. He approved of her\r\n      serving him and of all the women among the Sahaabah helping their husbands. This is a\r\n      matter concerning which there is no doubt.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>The hadeeth of Jaabir<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>The Shaykh of the Muhadditheen, Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah\r\n      have mercy on him) reported in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> that Jaabir ibn &#145;Abd-Allaah said:\r\n      &#147;My father died and left seven daughters, or nine daughters. I married a woman who\r\n      had been previously married, and the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n      be upon him) said to me, &#145;Did you get married, O Jaabir?&#146; I said,\r\n      &#145;Yes.&#146; He asked, &#145;A virgin or a previously-married woman?&#146; I said,\r\n      &#145;A previously-married woman.&#146; He said, &#145;Why not a young woman so you could\r\n      play and joke with one another?&#146; I said, &#145; &#145;Abd-Allaah [the father of\r\n      Jaabir] has died and left behind daughters, and I would not like to bring them someone who\r\n      is like them, so I got married to a woman who can take care of them.&#146; He said,\r\n      &#145;May Allaah bless you&#146; or &#145;Fair enough.&#146;&#148; (<i>Saheeh\r\n      al-Bukhaari bi Sharh al-&#145;Asqallaani<\/i>, vol.9\/513).<\/p>\r\n      <p>The evidence derived from the hadeeth of\r\n      Jaabir is that al-Bukhaari introduced this hadeeth under the heading, &#147;<i>Baab\r\n      &#145;awn al-mar&#146;ah zawjahaa fi waladih<\/i> (Chapter: a woman helping her husband\r\n      with his children)&#148;. <\/p>\r\n      <p>Imaam Ibn Hajar al-&#145;Asqallaani said, commenting on this\r\n      introduction by al-Bukhaari: &#147;It seems that al-Bukhaari derived the idea that a woman\r\n      should take care of her husband&#146;s children from the fact that the wife of Jaabir took\r\n      care of his sisters; if she should take care of his sisters then it is even more befitting\r\n      that she should take of his children.&#148; (<i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari bi Sharh\r\n      al-&#145;Asqallaani<\/i>, vol.9\/513).<\/p>\r\n      <p>We can say that the wife should take care of\r\n      her husband, as this is more befitting than her taking care of his sisters or his\r\n      daughters from another wife.<\/p>\r\n      <p>We may also understand from this hadeeth that what was\r\n      customary at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n      him) was that women did not only take care of their husbands, they also took care of those\r\n      who were dependent on their husbands and lived in their houses.<\/p>\r\n      <p>The evidence that this understanding is correct is the fact that\r\n      the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell Jaabir\r\n      off for his reason for marrying a previously-married woman, which was that she could take\r\n      care of his sisters. This indicates that the custom among the Muslims at that time\r\n      dictated that the wife should take care of those who were under her husband&#146;s care,\r\n      which means that the wife should serve her husband in those matters that are dictated by\r\n      local custom, because the husband&#146;s right to be served by his wife comes before that\r\n      of his sisters.<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>&#145;Urf (custom)<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>General contracts &#150; including marriage contracts &#150;\r\n    should be governed by the customs that are known among the people, and the custom is that\r\n    the wife should serve her husband and also take care of matters in the home. In some\r\n    societies, the custom is that the wife should take care of more than the regular domestic\r\n    matters.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Imaam al-Qurtubi said, concerning the matter of the wife\r\n    serving her husband and taking care of the home: &#147;This has to do with &#145;Urf,\r\n    which is one of the bases of sharee&#146;ah. The women of the Bedouin and the\r\n    desert-dwellers serve their husbands, even looking for fresh water and taking care of the\r\n    animals&#133;&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What happens nowadays is that the wife &#150; usually &#150;\r\n    serves her husband and takes care of different matters within the home. There may be a\r\n    servant to help her with that if her husband can afford it. If the husband knows that the\r\n    majority of scholars say that it is not obligatory for the wife to serve her husband and\r\n    take care of the house, I say that one of the benefits of this may be that he will not go\r\n    to extremes and demand too much of his wife in this regard, and that he will not give her\r\n    a hard time if she falls short, because what she is doing is not a duty according to the\r\n    majority of fuqaha&#146;. However, even it is a duty according to some of them &#150; and\r\n    this is what we think is more correct &#150; the fact that there is such a difference of\r\n    opinion means that the husband has to look at what she is doing as something voluntary\r\n    rather than obligatory, or something in which the scholars differ as to whether it is\r\n    obligatory, so he should be gentle with her if he sees that she is falling short in this\r\n    regard, and he should encourage her and help her to do it.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10113","question_id":"10113","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih\r\n    al&#146;-Uthaymeen, who replied as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Does the other partner agree to that?

Marriage is one of the strongest and most noble\r\n    covenants in the sight of Allaah, and the family is the most important unit in the\r\n    structure of society. It is essential that a person gives priority to putting his own\r\n    house in order and strives to teach his family the laws of Allaah. One of the things that\r\n    he should make sure he teaches his wife is the duties that she has towards her husband,\r\n    and the rights that are due to her.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Islam has stated these rights and duties, and it obliges and urges both\r\n    spouses to fulfil them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133; And\r\n    they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar to (those of their husbands) over\r\n    them to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over\r\n    them&#133;&#148; [al-Baqarah 2:228]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>The aayah states that for every right there is a reciprocal duty which\r\n    must be fulfilled. In this way balance is achieved between them in all aspects, which\r\n    supports the stability of family life. Ibn &#145;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him)\r\n    said concerning the aayah: &#147;It means: they have the right to good companionship and\r\n    kind treatment on the part of their husbands, just as they have to obey their husbands in\r\n    whatever they tell them to do.&#148; Ibn Zayd said: &#147;Fear Allaah concerning them just\r\n    as they have to fear Allaah concerning you.&#148; Al-Qurtubi said: &#147;This aayah\r\n    includes all the marital rights and duties.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among these rights and duties are:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Turning a blind eye to faults and mistakes, especially words and deeds\r\n    by which nothing bad was intended. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133;\r\n    those who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily Allaah loves as muhsinoon (the\r\n    good-doers).&#148; [Aal &#145;Imraan 3:134]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Both husband and wife must put up with one another, for every child of\r\n    Adam may slip, and the person whom one should put up with the most is the one with whom\r\n    one lives and mixes the most. Neither party should resort to a tit-for-tat response. If\r\n    one spouse sees the other becoming very angry, he or she should restrain his or her own\r\n    anger and not respond immediately. For this reason Abu&#146;l-Darda&#146; (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him) said to his wife: &#147;If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I see\r\n    you angry I will calm you down, otherwise we cannot live together.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the most important duties is:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Each spouse should advise the other to obey Allaah. According to a\r\n    saheeh hadeeth, some of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him): &#147;Can you tell us which kind of wealth is the best, so that we may strive\r\n    to acquire it?&#148; He said: &#147;The best (wealth) is a remembering tongue (one which\r\n    always remembers Allaah), a thankful heart, and a believing wife who will help you with\r\n    your faith.&#148; (Reported by Ahmad, 5\/278; al-Tirmidhi, 3039; <i>Saheeh\r\n    al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 5231)<\/p>\r\n    <p>A man should not hate his wife if he sees in her\r\n    something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will\r\n    like another which will make up for it. It was reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;No believing man should hate a believing\r\n    woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with another.&#148; (Reported\r\n    by Muslim, 36).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Woman was created\r\n    from a rib, and if you try to straighten the rib you will break it, so be gentle with her\r\n    and you will be able to live with her.&#148; (Reported by Ahmad, 5\/8; Ibn Maajah,\r\n    1308; <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 2\/163).<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of the most important things that can make married\r\n    life happy is a good attitude, hence Islam raised its status. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached the utmost heights of good treatment of others\r\n    and good attitude. Abu&#146;l-Darda&#146; reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;There is nothing that can be placed in the scales that\r\n    will weigh heavier than a good attitude, and a good attitude can help a person reach the\r\n    status of one who fasts and prays.&#148; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu\r\n    Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;The most perfect of\r\n    the believers in faith are those who are the best in attitude, and the best of you are\r\n    those who are best to their women.&#148; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1\/217; Ahmad,\r\n    2\/250; <i>al-Silsilah<\/i> <i>al-Saheehah<\/i>, 284).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Both spouses should turn a blind eye and avoid picking\r\n    on matters great and small, or rebuking and scolding about any matter except duties\r\n    towards Allaah. This is what Allaah tells us to do (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133;\r\n    And live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a\r\n    thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good.&#148; [al-Nisa&#146; 4:19].<\/i> <\/p>\r\n    <p>As far as different environments are concerned, a man should take care\r\n    to pay special attention to this, such as allowing his wife to mix with good women from\r\n    among her surroundings and intelligent, well-mannered women from among your surroundings.\r\n    Although she must obey you and not go out of your house without permission, at the same\r\n    time you should not prevent her from going out to places where she wants to go, so long as\r\n    there is nothing bad there. You should let her receive trustworthy women in her house, in\r\n    order to have some social life and a refreshing change of routine, especially in our times\r\n    when many women no longer obey the Divine command to remain in their homes and do not pay\r\n    proper attention to it &#150; especially Muslim women who live in non-Muslim countries\r\n    where there is too much freedom.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We also advise you to give her some freedom of choice in issues that do\r\n    not cause any harm, such as choosing food, colours for things in the house, or gifts to be\r\n    given on various occasions. You should also seek her opinion in matters of concern to you\r\n    both, such as naming your children &#150; knowing that this is your right according to\r\n    Islam &#150; and where to spend your vacation. <\/p>\r\n    <p>You should also involve her and seek her opinion when making some\r\n    decisions in which it is appropriate to include her, such as dealing with behavioural\r\n    problems in your children, finding ways to reconcile disputing relatives or neighbours,\r\n    and especially in resolving the problems between the two of you. Try to raise her level of\r\n    education with suitable reading material and attendance at gatherings where the program\r\n    and fellow-attendees will help to achieve the desired aim. Such programs may be available\r\n    in some Islamic centres. Know that paying attention to her intellectual level, working\r\n    with her way of thinking, understanding her psychology, treating her appropriately, being\r\n    good to her and making her feel good are among the most effective ways of showing how wise\r\n    and manly you are and how good your personality is. We ask Allaah to reconcile between you\r\n    and bring you back together, and help you both to do that which He likes and which pleases\r\n    Him.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10116","question_id":"10116","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have explained in the answer to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]11774[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]21536 [\\fatin]the ruling on \r\n    women covering their faces and hands, and that it is obligatory for them to \r\n    cover them in front of non-mahram men.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has enjoined woman to be obedient to her husband, and \r\n    has made men qawwaamoon (protectors and maintainers) of women.

If that does not work, then he may hit \r\n    her, but in a manner that is not severe, and there is nothing wrong with \r\n    also threatening her with divorce.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, \r\n    admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat \r\n    them (lightly, if it is useful)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa 4:34]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa&rsquo;di said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;<i>those women on whose part you see ill-conduct<\/i>&rdquo; means, \r\n    those who refuse to obey their husbands and disobey them in word or deed; \r\n    they should be disciplined gradually. &ldquo;<i>Admonish them (first)<\/i>&rdquo; means, \r\n    explain the ruling of Allaah concerning obedience to one&rsquo;s husband, \r\n    encouraging obedience and warning against disobedience.

If one of these methods achieves the desired result and the wife \r\n    obeys, then &ldquo;<i>seek not against them means (of annoyance)<\/i>&rdquo; i.e., you \r\n    have got what you wanted, so do not keep rebuking them for things that are \r\n    in the past, or draw attention to faults that will cause trouble if you \r\n    mention them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tafseer al-Sa&rsquo;di<\/i>, p. 142.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You can seek help in admonishing her and advising her by \r\n    means of useful tapes and books which speak of the obligation of hijab for \r\n    the Muslim woman, and explain the seriousness of disobedience and its \r\n    consequences in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to be gentle and kind with her.

Metaphors are\r\n    used in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah to refer to things about which people usually feel\r\n    shy. Does this apply only to the nighttime, or does it include daytime too? The answer may\r\n    be found in a hadeeth narrated by Muslim: &ldquo;By the One in Whose hand is my soul, there\r\n    is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the\r\n    heavens [i.e. Allaah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with\r\n    her.&rdquo; Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibbaan report a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir: &ldquo;There\r\n    are three whose prayers will not be accepted and none of whose good deeds will ascend to\r\n    heaven: a runaway slave, until he returns to his master; a drunken man until he becomes\r\n    sober; and a woman with whom her husband is angry, until he is pleased with her.&rdquo;\r\n    These are general terms, which include both night and day.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The phrase &ldquo;and he spends the night angry with her&rdquo; refers to\r\n    the cause of the angels&rsquo; curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is\r\n    a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the\r\n    matter drop. Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless\r\n    she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it,\r\n    and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. But if he is the one who started\r\n    it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame. In one report, instead of\r\n    the words &ldquo;the angels curse her until morning,&rdquo; the wording is &ldquo;&hellip;\r\n    until she returns&rdquo; &ndash; and this is a useful variant.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This hadeeth tells us that denying a spouse&rsquo;s rights &ndash;\r\n    whether physical or financial &ndash; is something that will inevitably bring about the\r\n    wrath of Allaah, unless Allaah grants His mercy to the sinner.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We also learn that the angels will pray against a sinner so long as he\r\n    or she persists in the sin. <\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth also directs a wife to help her husband and seek his\r\n    satisfaction, because a man is less patient than a woman when it comes to doing without\r\n    intercourse. The most disturbing thing for a man is his sexual impulse, so Islam urges\r\n    women to help their husbands in this regard.

Breastfeeding is proven in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and by\r\n    ijmaa&rsquo; (scholarly consensus).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Qur&rsquo;aan: Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;&hellip;\r\n    your foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n    [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:23].<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>Sunnah: Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;What is forbidden by radaa&rsquo; (suckling or\r\n    breastfeeding) is the same as what is forbidden by nasab (lineage).&rdquo; (Agreed\r\n    upon; al-Bukhaari, Muslim, 1444).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ijmaa&rsquo;: The scholars agree that the effect of\r\n    radaa&rsquo; (breastfeeding) prohibits marriage and creates the relationship of mahram, and\r\n    permits seeing and being alone (with the people to whom one is related through\r\n    radaa&rsquo;).<\/p>\r\n    <p>2. For breastfeeding to have the effect of transmitting its benefits\r\n    from the nursing woman to the child suckled, it must meet certain conditions, which are:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The breastfeeding must happen within the first two years of the\r\n        child&rsquo;s life, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;The\r\n        mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those\r\n        (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:233]. <\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <\/i>\r\n      <li><p>The number of breastfeedings must total the known five feeds, in which\r\n        the child eats his fill as if eating and drinking. If the child leaves the breast for a\r\n        reason, such as to take a breath or to switch from one breast to the other, this (i.e.,\r\n        each separate time the child latches on) is not counted as one breastfeeding. This is the\r\n        opinion of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, and the opinion favoured by Ibn al-Qayyim. The definition of\r\n        rad&rsquo;ah (one breastfeeding) is when the child sucks at the breast and drinks until the\r\n        milk enters his stomach, then he leaves the breast of his own accord. The evidence for the\r\n        number five (number of breastfeedings) is the report from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah\r\n        be pleased with her) who said: &ldquo;There was in the Qur&rsquo;aan [an aayah which\r\n        stipulated that] ten [was the number of] breastfeedings which created the relationship of\r\n        mahram, then this was abrogated [by another aayah which stipulated] five. The Messenger of\r\n        Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died and [the aayah which\r\n        stipulated five] was still being recited as part of the Qur&rsquo;aan.&rdquo; (Reported\r\n        by Muslim, 1452). In other words, the abrogation came so late that when the\r\n        Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, some people had not yet\r\n        heard that this aayah had been abrogated, but when they heard that it had been abrogated,\r\n        they stopped reciting it, and agreed that it should not be recited, although the ruling\r\n        mentioned in the aayah remained in effect. This is an abrogation of the recitation without\r\n        abrogation of the ruling, which is one type of abrogation. Having understood this,\r\n        breastfeeding after the first two years does not create any relationship of mahram. This\r\n        is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and among the references which they quote is\r\n        the aayah cited above, along with the hadeeth of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n        Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Nothing of breastfeeding creates the relationship of mahram\r\n        except what fills the stomach to bursting point, before (the age of) weaning.&rdquo;\r\n        Reported by al-Tirmidhi. (No. 1152), who said: This is a hasan saheeh hadeeth. The\r\n        application of this according to the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others is that breastfeeding does not\r\n        create the relationship of mahram except when it is within the first two years, and\r\n        anything after the first two whole years does not create any such relationship.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>There are some other reports from the Sahaabah, such as that narrated\r\n    from Abu &lsquo;Atiyah al-Waadi&rsquo;i, who said: &ldquo;A man came to Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and\r\n    said: &lsquo;My wife was with me and her breasts were full of milk (she was engorged). I\r\n    began to suck it and spit it out. Then I came to Abu Moosa.&rsquo; He (Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood)\r\n    said, &lsquo;What did you tell him?&rsquo; So he (Abu Moosa) told him what he had told him.\r\n    Then Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood stood up, took the man&rsquo;s hand (and said), &lsquo;Do you think\r\n    this is an infant? Breastfeeding is what produces the growth of flesh and blood.&rsquo; Abu\r\n    Moosa said: &lsquo;Do not ask me anything when this scholar is among you.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported\r\n    by &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>, 7\/463, no. 13895).<\/p>\r\n    <p>In <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> (2\/603), Maalik reported that\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: &ldquo;There is no breastfeeding except for the one who is breastfed\r\n    in infancy; there is no breastfeeding for one who is grown up.&rdquo; Its isnaad is saheeh.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Maalik also reported in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah\r\n    ibn Dinar said: &ldquo;A man came to &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar when I was with him in\r\n    the court-house, asking him about breastfeeding one who is grown up. &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn\r\n    &lsquo;Umar said: &lsquo;A man came to &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab and said, &ldquo;I have a\r\n    slave-girl with whom I used to have sexual relations, and my wife went to her and gave her\r\n    her milk, then when I went to her, she said, &lsquo;Stop, by Allaah I have given her my\r\n    milk.&rsquo;&rdquo; &lsquo;Umar said, &ldquo;Punish her (your wife), and (continue to) go to\r\n    your slave-girl, for (the ruling on) breastfeeding only applies to breastfeeding of\r\n    infants.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; Its isnaad is saheeh.<\/p>\r\n    <p>From this is it clear that drinking one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s milk has no\r\n    effect and does not create the relationship of mahram. Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>\r\n    (9\/201): &ldquo;One of the conditions of breastfeeding creating the relationship of mahram\r\n    is that it should be within the first two years. This is the opinion of most of the\r\n    scholars. Something like this was narrated from &lsquo;Umar, &lsquo;Ali, Ibn &lsquo;Umar, Ibn\r\n    Mas&rsquo;ood, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, Abu Hurayrah and the wives of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), apart from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah. It was also the opinion\r\n    of al-Shi&rsquo;bi, Ibn Shubrumah, al-Oozaa&rsquo;i, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ishaaq, Abu Yoosuf,\r\n    Muhammad, and Abu Thawr, and was narrated in one report from Maalik.<\/p>\r\n    <p>On the basis of the above, drinking one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s milk has no\r\n    effect, but it is better to avoid it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked about this\r\n    matter, and he replied: Breastfeeding a grown-up has no effect, because the breastfeeding\r\n    which has an effect (of creating the relationship of mahram) is that which consists of\r\n    five feedings or more within the first two years, before weaning. On this basis, if it\r\n    happened that someone breastfed from his wife or drank her milk, he does not become her\r\n    son. <i>Fataawa Islamiyah<\/i>, 3\/338.

As long as people vary in their abilities it is\r\n    not possible for sharee&rsquo;ah to impose a specific number in such cases. But intercourse\r\n    is the right of the wife and is a duty on the husband.

All people are agreed on this, because all peoples give women the best of\r\n    adornments, which is only to make up for this natural lack...&quot;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Rare cases among women are nothing to go by, because the exception does\r\n    not change the rule.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of the reasons why men are given the role of qiwaamah include:<\/p>\r\n    <p>1. Men are more intelligent and have a better ability to distinguish right\r\n    from wrong. Al-Qurtubi said: &quot;Men have the advantage of being more wise and more\r\n    capable of management; for this reason they were given the right of qiwaamah.&quot; 2.\r\n    Men&rsquo;s religion is more complete, because women menstruate and bleed after childbirth,\r\n    and do not pray or fast at such times - unlike men. 3. Spending money in charity and on\r\n    one&rsquo;s family is a duty on men, but not on women. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Thus if a man refuses to spend on his wife, she has the right to seek an\r\n    annulment of the marriage by going to a Qaadi (Sharee&rsquo;ah judge). <\/p>\r\n    <p>In summary, qiwaamah is only for men, as is made clear in the\r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan. If a woman spends on her husband, herself and her children, this is an act\r\n    of kindness on her part, as Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the\r\n    meaning): &quot;... but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it (the\r\n    mahr) to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it\r\n    lawful).&quot; [al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:4] Qiwaamah is for men in all cases: one can hardly\r\n    imagine a man asking his wife for permission to go out, for example.

He should\r\n    give her room for polite debate, and he should realize that it is not right for him to\r\n    impose any view on her in a matter of fiqh that concerns her alone. He has nothing to do\r\n    with it if she is convinced of a different scholar&rsquo;s opinion, and she is permitted to\r\n    follow that scholar. The wife must be aware that the husband&rsquo;s rights are great, that\r\n    obeying him is obligatory and that pleasing him is part of pleasing Allaah. &lsquo;Abd\r\n    al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month\r\n    (Ramadaan), guards her modesty and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &ldquo;Enter\r\n    Paradise through whichever gate of Paradise you wish.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported\r\n    by Imaam Ahmad, 1573; <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 660). The Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, &ldquo;If I were to command anyone\r\n    to prostrate to anything other than Allaah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to\r\n    their husbands. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman will fulfil her\r\n    duty towards her Lord unless she fulfils her duty towards her husband, and if he asks her\r\n    for herself when she is sitting on a saddle, she should not refuse him.&rdquo; The phrase\r\n    &ldquo;he asks her for herself&rdquo; refers to the husband asking for intercourse, and the\r\n    phrase &ldquo;on a saddle&rdquo; refers to the saddle used for riding a camel. The hadeeth\r\n    is urging women to obey their husbands and if they cannot refuse them when they are in\r\n    this situation (i.e., about to ride off on a camel) then how can they refuse them in other\r\n    cases? (Hadeeth reported by Ibn Maajah, 1843; see also <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>,\r\n    5239, 5295). The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &ldquo;It is not right for any human being to prostrate to another; if it were right for\r\n    one human being to prostrate to another, I would have commanded women to prostrate to\r\n    their husbands because of the great rights that they have over them. By the One in Whose\r\n    hand is my soul, if a man were covered from head to foot with weeping sores oozing pus,\r\n    and his wife were to come to him and lick his sores (to clean them), this would not fulfil\r\n    the rights he has over her.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 12153; <i>Saheeh\r\n    al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 7725). <\/p>\r\n    <p>If the wife obeys her husband and treats him well for\r\n    the sake of Allaah, she will earn a great reward with Allaah.

They are far above such things. They asked him to spend on them at a\r\n    time when he had nothing, and he did not have to spend more than Allaah had bestowed upon\r\n    him.

The details of their opinions are as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The first opinion:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The husband has the right to prevent her from giving if the amount is\r\n    more than one third of her wealth, but he does not have this right with regard to lesser\r\n    amounts. This is the opinion of the Malikis and Hanbalis, and one of the two views\r\n    narrated from Ahmad. (<i>Sharh al-Khurashi<\/i>, 7\/103; <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/513; <i>Nayl\r\n    al-Awtaar<\/i>, 6\/22). The evidence for this is reports and <i>qiyaas<\/i>\r\n    (analogy).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the reports referred to are the following:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The report that Khayrah, the wife of Ka&#146;b ibn Maalik, came to the\r\n        Prophet with some jewellery of hers. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n        him) said: &#147;It is not permissible for a woman [to dispose of] her wealth without the\r\n        permission of her husband. Have you asked Ka&#146;b&#146;s permission?&#148; She said,\r\n        &#147;Yes.&#148; So the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n        sent for Ka&#146;b ibn Maalik, her husband, and asked him, &#147;Have you given permission\r\n        to Khayrah to give her jewellery in charity?&#148; He said, &#147;Yes,&#148; so the\r\n        Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted it from her. (Reported\r\n        by Ibn Maajah, 2380; its isnaad includes &#145;Abd-Allaah ibn Yahya and his father, who\r\n        are majhool (not known, i.e., not enough information is known about them to ascertain\r\n        whether they are trustworthy)).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      \r\n      <li><p>The report narrated from &#145;Umar ibn Shu&#146;ayb from his father\r\n        from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n        him) said in a khutbah (sermon) he gave: &#147;It is not permissible for a woman to give\r\n        anything except with the permission of her husband.&#148; (<i>Sunan Abi Dawood,\r\n        Buyoo&#146;, Baab<\/i> 84; <i>Sunan al-Nisaa&#146;i, Zakaah, Baab<\/i> 58; <i>Musnad Ahmad<\/i>,\r\n        2\/179; <i>Sunan Ibn Maajah<\/i>, 2\/798). According to another version:\r\n        &#147;A woman has no right to her money if she is married.&#148; (Reported by five,\r\n        except al-Tirmidhi).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>These reports are taken as evidence that a woman does\r\n    not have the right to spend her money except with her husband&#146;s permission, which\r\n    means that the husband&#146;s permission is a condition any time she wants to spend; his\r\n    right to stop her spending is limited to amounts over one-third of her wealth, because\r\n    there are reports that indicate that the owner has the right to dispose of one-third or\r\n    less of his wealth in his will, but he does not have the right to dispose of more than\r\n    that without the permission of his heirs. This is seen in the famous story of Sa&#146;d\r\n    ibn Abi Waqqaas, who asked the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if he\r\n    could give all of his wealth in charity, and he said, &#147;No.&#148; Sa&#146;d asked,\r\n    &#147;What about two-thirds?&#148; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said, &#147;No.&#148; Sa&#146;d said, &#147;What about half?&#148; The Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &#147;No.&#148; Sa&#146;d said, What\r\n    about a third?&#148; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said,\r\n    &#147;[Yes,] a third, but a third is still a lot.&#148; (Agreed upon)<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to their using qiyaas (analogy) as evidence,\r\n    they say that the husband&#146;s rights are connected to the wife&#146;s wealth, on the\r\n    basis of the hadeeth: &#147;A woman may be married for her wealth, her beauty or her\r\n    religious commitment.&#148; (Reported by the seven scholars).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Usually a husband increases his mahr because of the\r\n    wife&#146;s wealth, and he will be able to spend her money, and if he cannot afford to\r\n    spend on her, she will not complain (because she has her own money). This is similar to\r\n    the rights of heirs in relation to a sick person's wealth. (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>,\r\n    4\/514).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second opinion:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The husband has the right to stop his wife from spending in all cases,\r\n    whether it is a small amount or a large amount, except in the case of insignificant\r\n    things. This is the opinion of al-Layth ibn Sa&#146;d. (<i>Nayl al-Awtaar<\/i>,\r\n    6\/22).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The third opinion:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The woman is not allowed to spend anything of her wealth at all, except\r\n    with the permission of her husband. This is the opinion of Taawoos (<i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>,\r\n    5\/218). Ibn Hajar said in <i>al-Fath<\/i>, and Taawoos used as evidence, the hadeeth of\r\n    &#145;Umar ibn Shu&#146;ayb, &#147;It is not permissible for a woman to give anything of\r\n    her own wealth except with the permission of her husband.&#148; This was reported by Abu\r\n    Dawood and al-Nisaa&#146;i. Ibn Battaal said: &#147;The hadeeth narrated in this chapter\r\n    are more sound.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fourth opinion:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The woman has the right to spend her own money in all circumstances,\r\n    whether in a transaction or otherwise, whether this involves all of her wealth or part of\r\n    it. <u>This is the opinion of the majority, and is the opinion of the Hanafis,\r\n    Shaafa&#146;is and Hanbalis, and of Ibn al-Mundhir.<\/u> (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 4\/513; <i>al-Ansaaf<\/i>,\r\n    5\/342; <i>Ma&#146;aani al-Athaar<\/i>, 4\/354; <i>al-Baari<\/i>, 5\/318; <i>al-Awtaar<\/i>,\r\n    6\/22).<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is the soundest opinion, and is most in accordance\r\n    with the Qur&#146;aan, the Sunnah and common sense.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In the Qur&#146;aan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory\r\n    bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart,\r\n    but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy\r\n    it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).&#148;[al-Nisa&#146; 4:4]<\/p>\r\n    <\/i><p>Allaah allows the husband to take what his wife gives him\r\n    willingly.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual\r\n    relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the mahr (bridal money given by the\r\n    husband to the wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (mahr), unless the\r\n    women agree to forego it&#133;&#148;[al-Baqarah 2:237]<\/p>\r\n    <\/i><p>Here Allaah allows women to give up as much of the mahr as they\r\n    wish if their husbands divorce them, without them having to ask permission from anybody.\r\n    This indicates that women have the right to decide what to do with their own money, and\r\n    that a woman has rights to her wealth just as a man has rights to his wealth. (<i>Sharh<\/i>\r\n    <i>al-Ma&#146;aani al-Athaar<\/i>, 4\/352).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they\r\n    reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their\r\n    property to them&#133;&#148; [al-Nisa&#146; 4:6]<\/p>\r\n    <\/i><p>This clearly means that when the female orphan becomes wise and\r\n    discerning, she is allowed to handle her own wealth.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Similarly, when the women gave their jewellery in charity after the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had addressed them during his Eid\r\n    sermon, this was an indication that they are allowed to dispose of their wealth without\r\n    asking permission from anybody.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(See <i>Ittihaaf al-Khilaan bi Huqooq al-Zawjayn fi&#146;l-Islam<\/i>\r\n    by Dr. Fayhaan ibn &#145;Ateeq al-Mutayri, pp. 92-96).<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>Nayl al-Awtaar<\/i>: &#147;the majority of\r\n    scholars agreed that women are allowed [to handle their own wealth] with no restrictions\r\n    and without having to ask their husbands&#146; permission, so long as they are not\r\n    foolish, but if they are foolish, it is not permitted.&#148; It says in <i>al-Fath<\/i>:\r\n    &#147;The majority have a lot of evidence in the Qur&#146;aan and Sunnah.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The majority of scholars argued against those who used as evidence the\r\n    hadeeth &#147;It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the\r\n    permission of her husband.&#148; (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3079; <i>Saheeh\r\n    al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 7265; some of its narrators have already been mentioned). The majority of scholars said that this has to do with the good manners and\r\n    proper etiquette required of the wife because of the rights her husband has over her, and\r\n    because of his status, experience in life and wisdom. Al-Sindi said in his commentary on\r\n    al-Nisaa&#146;i with regard to the hadeeth quoted: &#147;According to the majority of\r\n    scholars, this has to do with good manners and making the husband feel good.&#148; It was\r\n    reported from al-Shaafa&#146;i that the hadeeth was not proven, so how can we use it as\r\n    evidence when the Qur&#146;aan, Sunnah, other reports and common sense indicate the\r\n    opposite? Maymoonah freed a slave before the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) knew anything about it, and he did not tell her off. This and other reports\r\n    indicate that if this hadeeth is true, it is to be interpreted as being the matter of good\r\n    manners, and the wife has the option either to ask her husband&#146;s permission or not.<\/p>\r\n    <p>So the Muslim woman is encouraged to seek her husband&#146;s permission\r\n    &#150; but it is not obligatory for her to do so &#150; and she will be rewarded for doing\r\n    that. Abu Hurayrah said: &#147;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) was asked, &#145;Which woman is the best?&#146; He said, &#145;The one who makes\r\n    [her husband] happy when he looks at her, who obeys him when he tells her to do something,\r\n    and who does not oppose him in a manner he dislikes with regard to herself and her\r\n    wealth.&#146;&#148; (Reported by al-Nisaa&#146;i, 3179; <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>,\r\n    3292).<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10136","question_id":"10136","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If it is medically proven that birth control pills are\r\n    harmful to women, then it is not permissible to use them either before marriage or\r\n    afterwards, on the basis of the rule that no harm should be done.

Ibn &#145;Abbaas\r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said concerning this aayah: &#147;It is their\r\n    (women&#146;s) right to good companionship and proper treatment on the part of their\r\n    husbands, and their duty to obey and do what their husbands tell them to do.&#148; Ibn\r\n    Zayd said: &#147;Fear Allaah with regard to them (wives) just as they should fear Allaah\r\n    with regard to you.&#148; Al-Qurtubi said: &#147;This aayah covers all the rights and\r\n    duties within marriage.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of those rights is that trivial mistakes should be overlooked,\r\n    especially words and deeds by which no harm was intended. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said: &#147;Every son of Adam makes mistakes, and the best of those who make mistakes\r\n    are those who repent.&#148; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2501; <i>Saheeh\r\n    al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 4\/171).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Both husband and wife have to be patient and put up with\r\n    one another, because everyone makes mistakes, and the one with whom you have to be most\r\n    patient is the one with whom you live and interacts with most. Neither party should resort\r\n    to tit-for-tat reactions. If one spouse sees that the other is very angry, he or she\r\n    should restrain his or her own anger, and not respond immediately. For this reason\r\n    Abu&#146;l-Darda&#146; said to his wife: &#147;If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I\r\n    see you angry, I will calm you down, otherwise it will be too difficult to live\r\n    together.&#148; The imaam of Ahl al-Sunnah, Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him)\r\n    married &#145;Abbaasah<\/p>\r\n    <p>bint al-Mufaddal, the mother of his son Saalih, and he used to say of\r\n    her: &#147;Umm Saalih lived with me for twenty years, and we never argued over the\r\n    slightest thing.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of the most important rights\/duties is that each spouse should\r\n    advise and remind the other to obey Allaah. It is reported in a saheeh hadeeth that a\r\n    group of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):\r\n    &#147;Teach us which kind of wealth is best, so that we may try to acquire it?&#148; He\r\n    said: &#147;The best is a remembering tongue (one that remembers Allaah), a grateful heart\r\n    and a believing wife who helps one&#146;s faith.&#148; (Reported by Ahmad, 5\/278;\r\n    al-Tirmidhi, 3039; <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 5231).<\/p>\r\n    <p>A man should not make his wife angry if he sees in her\r\n    something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will\r\n    like another, so he should balance the two. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;No believing man should hate a believing woman: if he\r\n    dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another.&#148; (Reported by\r\n    Muslim, 36). Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the\r\n    Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Woman was created\r\n    from a rib, and if you try to straighten a rib you will break it, so deal with her\r\n    gently.&#148; (Reported by Ahmad, 5\/8; Ibn Hibbaan, 1308; <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>,\r\n    2\/163).<\/p>\r\n    <p>One of the best ways to ensure a good atmosphere between\r\n    husband and wife is a good attitude, hence Islam placed an important emphasis on this\r\n    matter. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the ultimate in\r\n    good treatment of others and good attitude. Abu&#146;l-Darda&#146; reported that the\r\n    Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;There is no good deed\r\n    that will be put in the balance that will weight heavier than a good attitude. The one who\r\n    has a good attitude will reach, because of it, the level of those who fast and pray.&#148;\r\n    (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may\r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) said: &#147;The most perfect of the believers in faith are the best in\r\n    attitude, and the best of you are those who are best to their womenfolk.&#148; (Reported\r\n    by al-Tirmidhi, 1\/217; Ahmad, 2\/250; <i>Al-Silsilat al-Saheehah<\/i>, 284).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of the ways in which one can treat one&#146;s wife\r\n    well are to turn a blind eye and not to pick on things, great or small, and not to rebuke\r\n    or scold for every single incident, except in the case of duties towards Allaah. This is\r\n    how Allaah guides us in the Qur&#146;aan, when He says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133;\r\n    and live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a\r\n    thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good.&#148; [al-Nisa&#146; 4:19]<\/i>.\r\n    If a woman disobeys her husband and refuses to obey him, he has the right to discipline\r\n    her as prescribed by sharee&#146;ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;Men\r\n    are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel\r\n    the other, and because they (spend) to support them) from their means. Therefore the\r\n    righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and their husbands) and guard in the\r\n    husband&#146;s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g., their chastity, their\r\n    husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish\r\n    them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is\r\n    useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance).\r\n    Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great.&#148; [al-Nisa&#146; 4:34]<\/i>. This aayah\r\n    indicates that the husband has the right to discipline his wife when she disobeys his\r\n    orders or rebels against him, and that this discipline takes a step-by-step approach which\r\n    may reach the level of hitting, within certain conditions. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have\r\n    mercy on him) said: &#147;Know that Allaah does not command hitting in His Book in clear\r\n    terms except in this passage and with regard to the prescribed punishments (hudood), so\r\n    disobedience to husbands is equated with major sins, and Allaah has given the task (of\r\n    disciplining) to husbands, instead of leaders, and without the need for judges, witnesses\r\n    or evidence, because Allaah has entrusted wives to their husbands.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;Ill-conduct&#148; (<i>nushooz<\/i>) here refers to disobedience,\r\n    i.e., those on whose part you fear disobedience and rejection of Allaah&#146;s command to\r\n    obey their husbands. Allaah has made this discipline in stages, as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Admonition without &#147;forsaking&#148; them (refusing to share their\r\n        beds) or hitting them. So the woman is reminded of her duty to be a good companion and\r\n        treat her husband properly. If gentle admonition and kindly reminders do not work, then\r\n        the discipline is taken to the second stage:<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>&#147;Forsaking&#148;, by turning his back on her in bed or sleeping in\r\n        a separate bed. But he should not go to extremes in this by keeping away for more than\r\n        four months, which is the period set by Allaah for the one that swears not to approach his\r\n        wife. This &#147;forsaking&#148; should only be for the purposes of disciplining and\r\n        correcting, not for taking revenge or punishing.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Hitting in a manner that is not painful, because Allaah says\r\n        (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;beat them (lightly, if it is useful),&#148;<\/i>.\r\n        Ibn &#145;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &#147;Forsake her in her bed, and\r\n        if she mends her ways (this is good), but if not, then Allaah has given permission for you\r\n        to hit her in a way that is not painful.&#148; The husband must be careful to ensure that\r\n        his hitting is for the purpose of discipline and warning, and not for any other purpose,\r\n        so he must make sure that he hits as lightly as possible, by prodding with the fist and so\r\n        on. &#145;Ata&#146; said: &#147;I said to Ibn &#145;Abbaas: &#147;What is the hitting that\r\n        is not painful?&#148; He said, &#147;The siwaak (tooth-stick) and so on.&#148; (i.e.,\r\n        hitting with the siwaak).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said,\r\n    advising his ummah: &#147;Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a\r\n    trust from Allaah and they are lawful to you by the word of Allaah. Your rights over them\r\n    are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, so if they do\r\n    that then hit them in a way that is not painful.&#148; (Saheeh hadeeth). The husband should avoid hitting parts of the body that are sensitive, such as\r\n    the head and stomach, and the face, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) forbade hitting the face in general. Mu&#146;aawiyah ibn Haydah (may\r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &#147;I said, &#145;O Messenger of Allaah, what are the\r\n    rights of the wife of any one of us over us?&#146; He said, &#145;That you feed her as you\r\n    feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, and that you do not say &#147;May\r\n    Allaah make your face ugly&#148; or hit her&#148; i.e., in the face.&#146;&#148; (Reported\r\n    by Abu Dawood, 2\/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4\/446).<\/p>\r\n    <p>If she desists, and stops rebelling, then he is not\r\n    allowed to keep punishing her or to accuse her of saying or doing anything, as Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133;but if they return to obedience, seek not\r\n    against them means (of annoyance).&#148;<\/i> <\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to your particular situation, we do not know all the details\r\n    or the reason why you hit your wife or why she and her daughter attacked you. But we do\r\n    understand that you are the one who started it, you started by hitting her then you made\r\n    her angry by laughing at her, which is when the mistake on her part and that of her\r\n    daughter occurred. What we advise you to do is to let your wife come back to you and go\r\n    back to living together in one home. You should advise your wife to admit that she has\r\n    made a mistake, and explain to her the seriousness what she has done by disobeying you,\r\n    hitting you back and encouraging her daughter to misbehave towards you as you mentioned.\r\n    This girl must understand that she is a guest in the home of her mother&#146;s husband and\r\n    she has to respect the one who has given her refuge in his home. If her presence is making\r\n    things more complicated and causing more problems, then you must come to some agreement\r\n    with them for the girl to move to her own home. Seek the help of Allaah, have patience and\r\n    treat your wife well.

Islam taught them that it will be counted as charity so that they will not\r\n    give to others besides their wives until they (the wives) have enough, to encourage them\r\n    to give obligatory charity before they give voluntary charity.&#148; <\/p>\r\n    <p>Sa&#146;d ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: &#147;No matter what\r\n    you spend on your family, you will be rewarded, even for the morsel of food you put in\r\n    your wife&#146;s mouth.&#148; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3\/164, and Muslim, 1628).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported\r\n    that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;A dinar\r\n    spent for the sake of Allaah, a dinar spent to free a slave, a dinar given in charity to a\r\n    poor person, and a dinar spent on one&#146;s wife &#150; the greatest in reward of all\r\n    these is the dinar spent on one's wife.&#148; (Reported by Muslim, 2\/692)<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ka&#146;b ibn &#145;Ijrah (may Allaah be pleased with\r\n    him) said: &#147;A man passed by the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him), and his Companions were impressed with how strong and energetic he appeared. They\r\n    said, &#145;O Messenger of Allaah, if only this was for the sake of Allaah!&#146; The\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#145;If he is\r\n    going out to earn a living for his young children, this is for the sake of Allaah; if he\r\n    is going out to earn a living for his aged parents, this is for the sake of Allaah; if he\r\n    is going out to earn a living so he can keep himself from begging from others, this is for\r\n    the sake of Allaah; but if he is going out to boast and show off, then this is for the\r\n    sake of Shaytaan.&#146;&#148; (Reported by al-Tabaraani, <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>,\r\n    2\/8)<\/p>\r\n    <p>The salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them) understood\r\n    this duty properly, and said words to that effect. How marvellous are the words of the\r\n    great imaam &#145;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him): &#147;There\r\n    is nothing equivalent in reward to earning money to spend on your family, not even jihaad\r\n    for the sake of Allaah.&#148; (<i>Al-Siyar<\/i>, 8\/399).<\/p>\r\n    <p>At the same time, your wife should understand that the\r\n    husband&#146;s obligation to spend should be within his means and according to his\r\n    financial situation, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;Let the rich\r\n    man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him\r\n    spend according to what Allaah has given him.

When will women \r\n    understand that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This jealousy on the part of the wife of the brother who is \r\n    asking this question is going to destroy trust between her and her husband, \r\n    and lead to her wrecking her home with her own hands. This way of treating \r\n    the husband will destroy his love for her and cause it to be replaced with \r\n    hatred; it will destroy his desire to continue the marriage and will bring \r\n    it to a hasty end.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The wise wife is the one who weighs up matters carefully and \r\n    does not cause trouble to her husband or develop doubt and suspicion about \r\n    his normal activities. Rather she strives to generate trust between her and \r\n    him and to lay the foundations of love and happiness between her and him, so \r\n    that their married life will be harmonious, otherwise she will soon be \r\n    numbered among the divorcees.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our advice to the husband is to take it easy and not be \r\n    hasty. The nature of women is different from that of men, and there is no \r\n    one who is happy with his wife but there is some crookedness in her actions \r\n    and behaviour, which may be more or less according to her level of religious \r\n    commitment, common sense and good behaviour.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of \r\n    Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Woman is created \r\n    from a rib that will never become straight. So if you enjoy her, then enjoy \r\n    her with the crookedness that is in her, for if you try to straighten her \r\n    you will break her, and breaking her means divorcing her.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (3153) and Muslim (1468).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth indicates being kind towards women and treating \r\n    them gently, and putting up with crookedness in their nature and the \r\n    possibility of weakness in their intellect, and shows that it is not right \r\n    to divorce them for no reason, and that a man should not hope to straighten \r\n    her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i> (10\/57).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we think you should do is put up with her attitude and \r\n    try to reconcile with her and increase her knowledge and faith, giving her \r\n    what is required for that of beneficial books and tapes and good companions. \r\n    And you should make your kind treatment of her another means of achieving \r\n    that, as well as offering a great deal of supplication.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should understand that divorce is a means of breaking up \r\n    and scattering families, and it affects the wife and children in most cases. \r\n    Many people put up with bad behaviour on the part of their wives for the \r\n    sake of their children and in the interests of the children, so that they \r\n    raise them in a good way so that they could help their mother to be obedient \r\n    and to mend her ways. This is something that is tried and tested, and this \r\n    is what we think you should do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you cannot put up with her behaviour and you would end \r\n    up mistreating her and denying her her rights, then divorce her. Perhaps she \r\n    will come to her senses after the first or second divorce (talaaq), but if \r\n    she persists in the way she is behaving and you cannot put up with her, then \r\n    there are many other women besides her and Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>But if they separate \r\n    (by divorce), Allaah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His \r\n    Bounty.

Hence the \r\n    rights of the parents, especially the mother, take precedence over the \r\n    rights of all people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) and said: Which of the people is most deserving of my \r\n    good companionship?

For this reason one of the rights that the wife has over her \r\n    husband is that he should provide her with separate accommodation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (25\/109):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Putting the parents and the wife together in one home is not \r\n    permissible (and the same applies to other relatives). Hence the wife has \r\n    the right to refuse to live with either of them, because it is her right to \r\n    have separate accommodation where she feels safe with regard to herself and \r\n    her property. No one has the right to force her to do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of the majority of Hanafi, Shaafa&lsquo;i and \r\n    Hanbali fuqaha&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maalikis are of the view that a distinction should be \r\n    made between the wife of noble birth and the wife of lowly birth, and they \r\n    say that it is not permissible to make the wife of noble birth and the \r\n    parents live together in the same house, but doing that is permissible with \r\n    a wife of lowly birth, unless making the wife of lowly birth and the parents \r\n    live together will cause her some harm.

This is not a solution to the \r\n    problem, especially if you have any children from her. Moreover the problem \r\n    may arise again with any other wife whom you bring to live with your mother \r\n    in the same house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So what you should do is hasten to do this as soon as you \r\n    can, which is looking for a separate house for you and your wife.

In this way you can treat your mother kindly, relieve \r\n    her of the burden of problems with your wife and keep in constant touch with \r\n    her, whilst at the same time doing what you are obliged to do for your wife \r\n    of treating her kindly and giving her accommodation that is suited for her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See the answer to question number\r\n    [fatout]97810[\\fatout].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allah to guide you and set your affairs straight.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10152","question_id":"10152","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      The believer should think well of others, assume the best \r\n      and keep away from doubt and suspicion that have no basis, because Allah \r\n      says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

This is sinful aggression and enmity, \r\n    because the basic principle is that the Muslim&rsquo;s blood, honour, wealth and \r\n    skin are sacred and protected, and it is not permissible to strike him \r\n    except in cases where the Lawgiver has allowed striking that is not severe \r\n    and does not cause harm, if there is the fear of wilful defiance (nushooz) \r\n    on the part of the wife, and exhorting and shunning have not been to any \r\n    avail.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari narrated from Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) addressed the people and said: &ldquo;Do you know what day this is?&rdquo; They \r\n    said: Allah and His messenger know best. He said: &ldquo;Is it not the Day of \r\n    Sacrifice?&rdquo; We said: Yes indeed, O Messenger of Allah. He said: &ldquo;What land \r\n    is this? Is it not the sacred land?&rdquo; We said: Yes indeed, O Messenger of \r\n    Allah. He said: &ldquo;Your blood, your wealth, your honour and your skin are \r\n    sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in \r\n    this land of yours. Have I not conveyed (the message)? We said: Yes. He \r\n    said: &ldquo;O Allah, bear witness.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the husband continues to beat his wife in the manner \r\n    mentioned, it is permissible for her to ask for a divorce so as to relieve \r\n    herself of the harm this is befalling her, and it is permissible for her to \r\n    tell the police so that they can protect her against her husband's \r\n    aggression by making him promise not to beat her and threatening him with \r\n    imprisonment if he does that. But because the laws in the country where you \r\n    are living may dictate punishments that are not permissible, such as \r\n    forbidding the husband to enter his house or come near it, or ruling that \r\n    the house belongs to the wife, or detaining the husband for a period that is \r\n    not appropriate to his offence, we do not suggest that you should tell the \r\n    police at first. Rather you should refer your case to an Islamic \r\n    organisation such as al-Muntada al-Islami in London. Perhaps Allah will \r\n    bring about reconciliation at their hands and your referring to them may \r\n    bring about some good solution, or they may offer you some beneficial advice \r\n    on how to deal with the police and the likely consequences of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the husband continues like this and you do not want a \r\n    divorce, then there is nothing wrong with telling the police whilst avoiding \r\n    any unjust punishment. If it so happens that a verdict is issued in your \r\n    favour that is not correct, such as barring him from entering the house, it \r\n    is not permissible for you to act upon this verdict because the ruling of a \r\n    judge &ndash; even if he is Muslim &ndash; does not make permissible something that is \r\n    haraam, and does not make forbidden something that is halaal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide your husband and \r\n    set his affairs straight, and to guide you in your affairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10154","question_id":"10154","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      One should think positively of a Muslim and assume that he \r\n      is good and innocent so long as there is no reason for doubt and \r\n      suspicion, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

If the motive was thinking negatively of her with no \r\n    evidence or grounds for doing so, then this is contrary to what Allah has \r\n    enjoined of avoiding suspicion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Trying to make the wife commit some sins was also a mistake, \r\n    even if the intention was to test her. If we assume that she responded and \r\n    did fall into sin, that would not have proven that she had gone astray or \r\n    committed that sin before that, because a person may be weak at any moment \r\n    in the face of temptation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it is clear that this action was of no benefit; rather \r\n    it may be harmful and may encourage the wife to commit sin, and that would \r\n    increase your doubts without enabling you to find out the facts of the \r\n    matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It would be better to take care of your wife by getting in \r\n    touch with her and visiting her, and praying for good things for her, and \r\n    trying to increase her faith and piety, and letting her live near your \r\n    family or some righteous neighbours. These are means of attaining \r\n    righteousness and keeping away from evil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even more important than all of that is not being away from \r\n    her for a long time for the purpose of amassing money; rather you should \r\n    keep your journeys as short as possible, even if that results in more \r\n    expenses or reduces your earnings. Being keen to take care of your wife and \r\n    keep her chaste and give her her rights is more important and more \r\n    obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]13318[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]145815[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>.\r\n    <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10155","question_id":"10155","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The view that masturbation is haraam is the view of most of \r\n    the scholars and is supported by shar&lsquo;i evidence; in fact all sexual \r\n    gratification is limited in our sharee&lsquo;ah to the wife or concubine (and the \r\n    latter is not available in our time). Any other means of pleasure used by \r\n    people is only a means of immorality and spreading mischief in the land, let \r\n    alone the fact that it is contrary to the fitrah (sound human nature) with \r\n    which man has been created with regard to the way of fulfilling physical \r\n    desires. Whatever the case, we find it strange that masturbation is regarded \r\n    as a means of treating premature ejaculation. What we have read and learned \r\n    from dozens of medical websites and suggestions for treatment is that \r\n    masturbation is one of the causes of premature ejaculation; this is \r\n    according to the testimony of doctors first of all, and also that of those \r\n    who are suffering from this problem.

Part of kind \r\n    treatment is listening properly to what she is saying and responding \r\n    properly. Being right is not limited to men; it may be your wife&rsquo;s view that \r\n    is correct and her suggestions and advice may be good. What is preventing \r\n    you from letting her express her views and discussing them with her in a \r\n    friendly manner?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Remember how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) listened to the advice of his wife Umm Salamah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her) and adopted it in a matter of great importance. That was \r\n    during the well-known Treaty of al-Hudaybiyah, when she suggested to him \r\n    that he should go out and not speak to anyone among his Companions until he \r\n    had slaughtered his hadiy (sacrificial animal) and shaved his head. Our \r\n    Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did as his wife \r\n    (may Allah be pleased with her) suggested and there was a great deal of good \r\n    in that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we advise you to be the one to start a discussion \r\n    between you and your wife and open your heart and mind to what she has to \r\n    say, and listen attentively. Then you can either accept what she says and \r\n    thank her, or reject it gently whilst also thanking her. Do not forget that \r\n    she is your life partner and the one who is helping you to raise your \r\n    children and organise your household. So it is not appropriate to close the \r\n    doors of discussion to her. You should not be too proud of your opinion and \r\n    or feel that you do not need to discuss with her and hear her opinion. Do \r\n    not neglect the words of your Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him): &ldquo;The best of you is the one who is best to his wife.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by at-Tirmidhi, 3895; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Jaami&lsquo;<\/i>, 3314. Over and above that, do not forget the words of Allah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And live with them honourably&rdquo; \r\n    [an-Nisa&rsquo; 4:19]<\/i>. Discussion between the spouses increases the love \r\n    between them and strengthens the bond between them; it also helps to reach \r\n    the right decision in matters of married life and household and family \r\n    affairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Remember that the consequences of this attitude towards your \r\n    wife may backfire on you; she may refuse to give you any advice so long as \r\n    you do not accept what she offers you and is forced to agree with you even \r\n    if you are wrong. Thus you will be depriving yourself of a great deal of \r\n    good and beneficial advice. It suffices us to say to you: This attitude, in \r\n    which you insist on your opinion, do not admit your mistakes and do not \r\n    acknowledge that your wife could be right is the very essence of arrogance, \r\n    as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) defined it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Mas&lsquo;ood (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;No one will enter Paradise who has an atom&rsquo;s weight of arrogance \r\n    in his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A man said: What if a man likes his garment to look nice and \r\n    his shoes to look nice?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said: &ldquo;Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty. Arrogance is \r\n    rejecting truth and looking down on people.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, no. 91&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by rejecting truth is denying it out of \r\n    arrogance and pride.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Looking down on people means scorning them and thinking \r\n    little of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Don&rsquo;t you see that this is the essence of what you are doing \r\n    with your wife?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Are you content to have this attitude and hence this fate may \r\n    be yours?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    May Allah protect you from that, O slave of Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not the attribute of the wise and mature man to insist \r\n    when he is in the wrong that his wife should be the one to apologise. Rather \r\n    he is the one who should hasten to admit his mistake, apologise for it and \r\n    ask his wife to forgive him. And her duty is to apologize to her husband if \r\n    she is the one who is in the wrong. It is in this way that married life \r\n    takes a correct course and lasting love and compassion are strengthened \r\n    between the spouses. Abu&rsquo;d-Darda&rsquo; (may Allah be pleased with him) said to \r\n    his wife: &ldquo;If you see me angry, try to calm me down, and if I see you angry \r\n    I shall try to calm you down, otherwise we cannot live together.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatout]145463[\\fatout]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You could also benefit by reading the book <i>The Muslim \r\n    Home: 40 Recommendations<\/i>, which you can find in the Articles and Books \r\n    section of this website.

For that reason it is Sunnah for a man to offer a \r\n    feast at his wedding and to invite people to it.

It is well known that if a woman has been \r\n    divorced three times, then she becomes irrevocably divorced from her husband \r\n    and is not permissible for him until she has been married to another \r\n    husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What you \r\n    have mentioned is that your husband frequently says, &ldquo;My wife is divorced if \r\n    I do such and such&rdquo; then he does not do it. This is something concerning \r\n    which the scholars have differed. The majority are of the view that divorce \r\n    does take place if the oath is broken, i.e., if he does not do what he swore \r\n    he would do.<br>\r\n    See: <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (7\/372).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of the \r\n    scholars &ndash; including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) &ndash; were of the view that if a person issues a divorce in the form of an \r\n    oath, but his intention was to ensure doing something or refrain from doing \r\n    something, then if the oath is broken he has to offer kafaarat yameen \r\n    (expiation for breaking an oath) only, and the divorce does not count as \r\n    such. This is what was stated in fatwas by Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them). Based on this opinion, your \r\n    husband&rsquo;s intention should be examined. If he intended that a divorce should \r\n    take place when the condition was fulfilled, then divorce has taken place, \r\n    but if he intended to prevent himself or someone else from doing something, \r\n    or to compel himself or someone else to do something, then he broke the \r\n    oath, then this is an oath which may be expiated by offering kafaarat \r\n    yameen. See the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]39941[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Kafaarat \r\n    yameen (expiation for breaking an oath) involves freeing a slave or feeding \r\n    or clothing ten poor persons; if that is not possible then one must fast for \r\n    three days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to divorce issued at a time of anger, in some cases it counts as such and in \r\n    some cases it does not, depending on the type and degree of anger.

It is sufficient for him to note \r\n    that his staying with his wife now is a matter concerning which the scholars \r\n    differed, and the majority of them are of the view that he has divorced her \r\n    three times, especially if he utters these words frequently. Perhaps he has \r\n    divorced her ten times. Would a Muslim be happy for his staying with his \r\n    wife to be the subject of a difference of opinion among the scholars, most \r\n    of whom say that it is not permissible for you to stay with her? Verily to \r\n    Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What he has \r\n    to do is fear Allaah and understand the seriousness of the words that have \r\n    come out of his mouth. He should not swear by anything except Allaah, and he \r\n    should stop swearing by anything else.

See question No. <a>\r\n    20660<\/a>. This is something that is between the husband and his Lord if no \r\n    one hears him say that. With the regard to divorce via e-mail there is no \r\n    problem regarding the fact that it is valid: if the husband writes that he \r\n    is divorcing his wife then the divorce takes place by virtue of that \r\n    writing. But the issue here is whether this divorce can be proven and \r\n    authenticated (in court). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It seems that the husband&rsquo;s divorce of his wife via e-mail is \r\n    effective if it is proven definitively that the one who sent the e-mail \r\n    containing the words of divorce is the husband or someone whom the husband \r\n    appointed to issue the divorce, and he acknowledges that and does not deny \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if that cannot be proven and the husband does not \r\n    acknowledge it, then this e-mail message is not valid and divorce does not \r\n    take place in this case, because it is well known to those who work in this \r\n    field that it is possible to hack into e-mail accounts and send messages. So \r\n    we cannot be absolutely certain that the one who sent it is the husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So proof and confirmation must be sought from the husband, \r\n    and the the divorce should not be regarded as having taken place until after \r\n    it has been confirmed by the husband.

If he takes you back during the &lsquo;iddah, then this divorce \r\n    counts as one of the three divorces, and he has to bring witnesses to attest \r\n    to that. If he does not take you back during the &lsquo;iddah, then you are \r\n    divorced as soon as the &lsquo;iddah is over, and it is not permissible for him to \r\n    take you back without a new marriage contract and a new mahr, and he is \r\n    regarded as a stranger to you like any other man who may propose marriage, \r\n    and the marriage can only be done with your approval and the agreement of \r\n    your guardian.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The applies in the case of a second \r\n    divorce; if he takes you back during (the &lsquo;iddah) then you are his wife. In \r\n    the event of a third divorce, you become haraam for him until you have \r\n    married another husband in a legitimate shar&rsquo;i marriage which is not done \r\n    solely with the intention of enabling you to remarry your first husband, and \r\n    which is consummated in the proper manner.

For his \r\n    anger made him unaware of what he was saying, so he is like one who is \r\n    unconscious, insane or drunk, because of the intensity of his anger. So \r\n    divorce does not take place in this instance.

In this case too, divorce does not take place according to the \r\n    correct scholarly opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; The ordinary type of \r\n    anger which is not very intense. In this case, divorce takes place, \r\n    according to all the scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From <i>Fataawa al-Talaaq<\/i>, pp. 19-21, compiled by Dr. \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah al-Tayyaar and Muhammad al-Moosa.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What the Shaykh mentioned about the second type of anger is \r\n    also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn \r\n    al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on them both). Ibn al-Qayyim wrote an essay \r\n    on that entitled <i>Ighaathat al-Lahfaan fi Hukm Talaaq al-Ghadbaan<\/i>, in \r\n    which he said the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Anger is of three types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; That which is not so intense as to affect a person&rsquo;s mind \r\n    or rational thinking; he knows what he is saying and what he means. There is \r\n    no dispute that in this case divorce, manumission and contracts are valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Where his anger reaches such a limit that he no longer \r\n    knows what he is doing or saying. There is no dispute that in this situation \r\n    divorce does not take place. If his anger is so intense that he does not \r\n    know what he is saying, there is no doubt that none of his words should be \r\n    implemented in this case. The words of the mukallif (adult of sound mind) \r\n    are only to be implemented if he knows what he is saying and what it means, \r\n    and if the speaker really means that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; The kind of anger that falls between the two categories \r\n    mentioned above, where the anger goes beyond the ordinary level but not so \r\n    far as to make him behave like a madman. This is an area of scholarly \r\n    differences of opinion. The shar&rsquo;i evidence indicates that divorce, \r\n    manumission and contracts in such cases are not valid, and this is a kind of\r\n    <i>ighlaaq<\/i> as the imams explained.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha, 5\/323; see also <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, \r\n    5\/215.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The husband has to fear \r\n    Allaah and avoid using the word of divorce (talaaq) so that this will not \r\n    lead to the disintegration of his family.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We advise husband and wife alike to fear Allaah and heed His \r\n    limits, and to look at what the husband said to his wife in a fair manner: \r\n    is this the ordinary kind of anger, which is the only case in which divorce \r\n    can take place, and this is the third type in which divorce does take place \r\n    according to scholarly consensus.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Obedience is only with regard to \r\n    that which is good and proper.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7245; Muslim, \r\n    1840). His parents&rsquo; orders to hasten to divorce her with no proven sin on \r\n    the wife&rsquo;s part is not something which is good and proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; With regard to the foetus in her womb, the basic \r\n    principle in sharee&rsquo;ah is that that the child belongs to the (marriage-) bed \r\n    and belongs to the husband, unless he disowns him, because of the hadeeth of \r\n    the Prophet: &lsquo;The child belongs to the (marriage-)bed and the adulterer is \r\n    to be stoned.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    i.e., the child is to be attributed to the husband and no \r\n    attention is to be paid to doubts and the like, especially in a case like \r\n    this where the doubts are far-fetched. Islam encourages us to attribute \r\n    children to their fathers, so this husband should not open the door to \r\n    waswaas (whispers of the Shaytaan) with regard to his son who will be born \r\n    to the wife he has divorced, because he has no evidence to the contrary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this husband wants to go back to his wife after this \r\n    divorce (talaaq), if she is still pregnant and he issued the talaaq once or \r\n    twice, then she is still his wife according to sharee&rsquo;ah, because her &lsquo;iddah \r\n    has not yet ended. Allaah says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced \r\n    or their husbands are dead), their &lsquo;Iddah (prescribed period) is until they \r\n    lay down their burden&rdquo; [al-Talaaq 65:4]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So he may take her back and ask two men to bear witness that \r\n    he is taking her back; in this way she will become his wife again. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if she has already given birth and this was the first or \r\n    second talaaq, then he may go back to her with a new contract, so long as it \r\n    meets all the necessary conditions.&nbsp; And he should beware of such news and \r\n    take care to protect his wife and keep her away from places which may give \r\n    rise to suspicion.

Al-Haafiz said in <i>al-Fath<\/i>:\r\n    Abu Dawood reported this hadeeth (from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah): &lsquo;The Messenger of Allaah\r\n    <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never used to prefer any of us over\r\n    others in sharing his time (i.e., he was fair in dividing his nights among his wives, and\r\n    each one of them had her allotted night). When Sawdah bint Zam&rsquo;ah grew old and feared\r\n    that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might\r\n    divorce her, she said: &lsquo;O Messenger of Allaah, my day is for\r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah,&rsquo; and he accepted this from her. Then concerning this and similar\r\n    cases, the aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): &lsquo;And if a woman fears\r\n    cruelty or desertion on her husband&rsquo;s part&hellip;&rsquo; [al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:128]. These\r\n    reports agree that she feared divorce and so gave her day to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Then al-&lsquo;Allaamah al-Mubaraakpoori said: The aayah may be explained\r\n    thus: &lsquo;<i>If a woman fears<\/i>&rsquo; means if she expects. &lsquo;Cruelty&rsquo; means\r\n    that he spurns her by refusing to sleep with her or by spending less on her than he\r\n    should, because he dislikes her and wants to marry someone more beautiful. &lsquo;<i>Desertion&rsquo;<\/i>\r\n    means that he turns his face away from her. &lsquo;<i>There is no sin on them both if they\r\n    make terms of peace between themselves&rsquo;<\/i> means with regard to the sharing of his\r\n    time and his spending on her, i.e., he should still give her something in this regard\r\n    (sharing time or spending) in order to preserve the relationship: if she accepts, this is\r\n    OK, otherwise the husband must either give her her full rights or divorce her. &lsquo;<i>Making\r\n    peace is better&rsquo;<\/i> means better than separation, cruelty and desertion.

The majority are of the view that it does count as such, but a \r\n    number of them were of the view that it does not count as such. This is the \r\n    view of many contemporary scholars such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). See also the answer to question \r\n    no.

The fuqaha&rsquo; differed concerning the threefold \r\n    divorce. The most correct view is that it counts as one divorce, whether he \r\n    uttered in one phrase such as saying &ldquo;You are thrice divorced&rdquo;, or he \r\n    uttered it in separate phrases, such as saying &ldquo;You are divorced, you are \r\n    divorced, you are divorced.&rdquo; This was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam \r\n    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and was regarded as more correct \r\n    by Shaykh al-Sa&rsquo;di and Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on this, it seems \r\n    from what you say that you have been divorced once.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>However, we say that with regard to divorce, every case must be examined in detail.

This indicates that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined raising the hands when \r\n    the worshipper wants to bow, and when he raises his head from bowing. Every \r\n    phrase that has been narrated concerning this shows that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) raised his hands when he bowed. \r\n    This is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>O you who believe!

Should (the worshipper) raise his \r\n    hands when he is still sitting, then say takbeer and get up? Or should he \r\n    not raise his hands until after he has stood up? Which is the more correct \r\n    view?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is prescribed to raise the hands in prayer when getting up \r\n    after the first tashahhud, and say takbeer after one has started to move \r\n    from sitting to standing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq \r\n    &lsquo;Afeefi, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> \r\n    (6\/347).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second opinion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars said that the hands should be raised after \r\n    standing up, and that it is not necessary to raise the hands at the same \r\n    time as saying takbeer; the takbeer may come before raising the hands, or \r\n    raising the hands may come before the takbeer, or they may be done at the \r\n    same time. All of these are proven in the Sunnah about the places where one \r\n    is to say takbeer and raise the hands. Some of these imams do not think one \r\n    should say takbeer when sitting, even if it is without raising the hands, \r\n    rather they think it should be said when standing. They said: The text \r\n    should be understood in accordance with its apparent meaning, and the texts \r\n    prove that he used to raise his hands &ldquo;when he stood up&rdquo; which means when he \r\n    had finished standing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, the places where the hands are to be raised \r\n    are four:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When saying the opening takbeer, when bowing, when rising \r\n    from bowing, and when standing up after the first tashahhud, which should be \r\n    done after one has stood up, because the wording of the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n    is: &ldquo;When he stood up after two rak&rsquo;ahs, he raised his hands,&rdquo; and that can \r\n    only mean when he had finished standing. Based on this, (the worshipper) \r\n    should not raise his hands when he is sitting and then get up, as some \r\n    people imagine. It is known that the phrase &ldquo;when he stood up&rdquo; does not mean \r\n    when he was getting up, rather there is a difference between the two.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no raising of the hands apart from that. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (3\/214).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is with regard to raising the hands. As for saying \r\n    takbeer, the Shaykh &ndash; may Allaah have mercy on him &ndash; said that it should \r\n    come between the two positions, not with either one of them. With regard to \r\n    the issue under discussion here, he should say takbeer whilst moving to \r\n    stand up, and raise his hands when he had stood up fully.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The takbeer for moving from one posture of the prayer to \r\n    another should be said between the two posture. So when he wants to \r\n    prostrate, he should say takbeer between standing and prostrating, and when \r\n    he wants to stand up after prostrating, he should say takbeer between \r\n    prostrating and standing. This is what is best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he starts to say takbeer before he goes down to prostrate, \r\n    and completes it as he is going down, there is nothing wrong with that. \r\n    Similarly if he starts it whilst he is going down and does not complete it \r\n    until he is prostrating, there is nothing wrong with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> \r\n    (13\/question no. 511).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What makes it more likely that this view is correct is what \r\n    it says in the third hadeeth &ndash; the hadeeth of &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) &ndash; in which he says &ldquo;he did not raise his hands at any point during \r\n    his prayer when he was sitting&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It seems that this view is the one that was regarded as more \r\n    correct by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked <b>about raising \r\n    the hands after standing up following the sitting after the first two \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs<\/b>: is it recommended?

That is because of the reports narrated by Abu Dawood (2226), \r\n    al-Tirmidhi (1187) and Ibn Maajah (2055) from Thawbaan (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce when it is not \r\n    absolutely necessary, the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden to her.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And it was narrated from &lsquo;Uqbah ibn &lsquo;Aamir (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Those who ask for khula&rsquo; are hypocrite women.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Tabaraani in <i>al-Kabeer<\/i> (17\/339); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n    in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>.

So no divorce or \r\n    zihaar takes place.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It \r\n    should be noted that divorce can only take place after marriage, because it \r\n    is the dissolution of the marriage bond. So before marriage there is no \r\n    divorce. Even if a man says to a woman: If I marry you, then you are \r\n    divorced, then he marries her, she is not divorced. Or if a man's wife said \r\n    to him: I heard that you want to take a second wife and I do not agree to \r\n    that, and she put pressure on him, and he said to her: Will you be pleased \r\n    if I say that if I marry a woman, she is divorced?

If he wrote it but did not intend to divorce, then \r\n    it does not count as a divorce. That is because signing is not a clear \r\n    statement of divorce, and that which is not a clear statement could not be \r\n    ruled to count as a divorce except with the intention of divorce. There are \r\n    some scholars who think that signing on its own does not count as a divorce \r\n    in any case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said, answering a similar question: We have studied your question that you \r\n    addressed to us and we understand from it that something happened between a \r\n    man and his wife that made him angry with her, and his maternal uncle \r\n    suggested that he divorce her. The uncle took a piece of paper and wrote \r\n    with his own hand &ldquo;So and so is divorced three times&rdquo;, meaning the wife of \r\n    his nephew. He gave the paper to his nephew to sign it, and he signed it \r\n    without saying anything.

It does not come \r\n    under the heading of writing, because the husband did not write that he was \r\n    divorcing his wife so that it may be regarded as a divorce on the basis of \r\n    writing. The most that can be said about this matter is that he wrote his \r\n    name beneath the words written by someone else. If he did not say any of the \r\n    words that were written on the paper mentioned, and he only wrote his name \r\n    at the bottom, it does not seem to us that divorce has taken place as a \r\n    result of his signing this piece of paper.

So if the husband says &ldquo;<i>Israhi<\/i> (you may \r\n    leave)&rdquo; to his wife, it counts as a divorce and if he says, &ldquo;I did not \r\n    intend divorce,&rdquo; that is not acceptable unless there is circumstantial \r\n    evidence to show that he did not intend to divorce, such as if he said to \r\n    her, &ldquo;Israhi (you may leave)&rdquo; immediately after telling her to go out early \r\n    to work in the fields.

For example he mentioned: if he said to her &ldquo;Israhi \r\n    (you may leave)&rdquo; immediately after telling her to go out early to work in \r\n    the fields, then this is to be accepted as it appears to be. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the Maalikis were of the view that divorce takes \r\n    place if the word &ldquo;<i>Israhi<\/i>&rdquo; is spoken even if that is without the \r\n    intention of divorce, because it is explicit according to some of them, or \r\n    it is a word that is used in a metaphoric way with a clear meaning that does \r\n    not need intention.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that of the majority, which is that no \r\n    divorce takes place if the husband says &ldquo;<i>Israhi<\/i>&rdquo; or similar phrases, \r\n    unless he intended divorce.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i> (7\/294): If he says, &ldquo;I have divorced you&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am leaving \r\n    you&rdquo; or &ldquo;You may leave (<i>israhi<\/i>)&rdquo;, that means that divorce has taken \r\n    place. This implies that explicit divorce is represented in three words: \r\n    &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; (<i>talaaq<\/i>), &ldquo;separation&rdquo; (<i>firaaq<\/i>) and &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; (<i>saraah<\/i>) \r\n    and other words or phrases derived from them. This is the view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&lsquo;i.&nbsp; Abu &lsquo;Abd-Allah ibn Haamid was of the view that explicit \r\n    divorce is represented only in the word &ldquo;<i>talaaq<\/i>&rdquo; and words\/phrases \r\n    derived from it. This is also the view of Abu Haneefah and Maalik, except \r\n    that Maalik said that it counts as divorce even if that was not the \r\n    intention, because metaphoric words of which the meaning is clear do not \r\n    need an intention. The evidence for this opinion is that words derived from\r\n    <i>firaaq<\/i> (separation) and <i>saraah<\/i> (leaving) are often used in \r\n    cases other than divorce, so they cannot be regarded as explicit expressions \r\n    of divorce.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the word <i>firaaq<\/i> (separation), this word \r\n    is mentioned in the Qur&rsquo;aan in the context of separation between the \r\n    spouses, so it may be explicit to that effect, like the word <i>talaaq<\/i>. \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>either you retain her on \r\n    reasonable terms or release her (tasreeh) with kindness<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:229]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>But if they separate [wa in \r\n    yatafarraqaa] (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of \r\n    them from His Bounty<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:130]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>then come!

If he thinks that it is valid, then the talaaq counts as such, \r\n    and there is no confusion concerning that. For example: a man got married to \r\n    a woman who breastfed from his mother three times, and he thinks that the \r\n    breastfeeding that makes a person a mahram is five feedings. So the marriage \r\n    is valid in his opinion. In this case talaaq undoubtedly counts as such.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, if he married a woman without witnesses, and he \r\n    thinks that witnessing in marriage is not a condition of it being valid. In \r\n    this case talaaq counts as such.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The married person does not \r\n    think that the marriage is valid. In this case the scholars differed as to \r\n    whether talaaq counts as such. Some of them said that talaaq does count as \r\n    such in this case, and some of them said that it does not. Those who said \r\n    that it does not count as such said that it is because talaaq is connected \r\n    to the marriage contract. He does not think that the marriage is valid, so \r\n    he cannot issue a talaaq. This reasoning is good and there is nothing wrong \r\n    with it.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who say that it does not count as such say that is \r\n    because, even though he does not think the marriage is valid, others may \r\n    think that it is valid. So if he leaves her without talaaq, then a man comes \r\n    to her who thinks that the marriage was valid, he can never marry her. So \r\n    talaaq is valid with regard to a marriage concerning the validity of which \r\n    there is a difference of opinion, even if the one who issues the talaaq does \r\n    not think this is valid, because if he does not divorce her by talaaq, this \r\n    will leave this woman in limbo.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If someone were to say: Why does the talaaq count as such \r\n    when he does not think that the marriage is valid and talaaq is connected to \r\n    it? We say: That is so that he will not prevent her from marrying someone \r\n    else, because someone who thinks that that marriage was valid may want to \r\n    marry her, and if this husband does not divorce her by talaaq, the other man \r\n    will never be able to marry her, because he thinks that she is still married \r\n    to him. Hence the author said: &ldquo;Talaaq counts as such in the marriage \r\n    concerning the validity of which there is a difference of opinion.&rdquo; And it \r\n    says in <i>al-Rawd<\/i>: &ldquo;even if the one who is issuing the talaaq does not \r\n    think that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i> by Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, \r\n    13\/25&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information please see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatout]116575[\\fatout]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if they did the marriage contract in the \r\n    manner mentioned in the question and they think that it was a valid \r\n    marriage, then it is essential to divorce by talaaq, so that their \r\n    separation will be confirmed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the husband refuses to divorce his wife by talaaq or to \r\n    accept her khula&lsquo;, and she will be harmed by staying with him, then in this \r\n    case she should refer the matter to the Muslim qaadi (judge) so that he can \r\n    issue a divorce (talaaq) from him.

Try to speak kindly to her and remind her of the life that you \r\n    have together, and of the blessing of Islam that Allah has bestowed upon \r\n    her; and remind her that it is not permissible for her to marry a non-Muslim \r\n    man if you do divorce her, so how could she form a relationship with him \r\n    when she is still married to you?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you can perform ruqya for her yourself, or you can find \r\n    someone who can do that, because of what you think of the possibility that \r\n    she has been affected by the Shaytaan, then do that, because perhaps it is \r\n    as you think; then perhaps Allah will heal her from this calamity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When you have done all that you are able to and have tried by \r\n    all available means to set her straight, then if she responds and you see \r\n    that she wants to repent from what she has done and adhere to her religion, \r\n    then keep her as your wife and strive to teach her about the religion and \r\n    help her to adhere to its rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you find that she is persisting in what she is doing \r\n    and exhortation has not worked with her and you cannot find any way to bring \r\n    her back to her house and make her obedient to you, then divorce her and \r\n    leave her to what she has chosen for herself. If you want to keep her and \r\n    refuse to give her a divorce (talaaq), and she resorts to khula&lsquo;, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with what you have done, because she is wronging herself and \r\n    her husband and is being defiantly disobedient; in fact she is seeking that \r\n    which is damaging to her religious and worldly interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10274","question_id":"10274","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    First of all, we ask Allah to make you steadfast in Islam and \r\n    to make things easy for you, and to choose for you that which is best in \r\n    this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Remember that the blessing of adherence to this great \r\n    religion should not be spoiled by anything that your husband does to you. \r\n    Such things happen in many families, but the laws and rulings of Islam \r\n    contain nothing but that which is in the best interests of the individual, \r\n    the family and society, and the one who goes against them is not harming \r\n    anyone but himself.

In that there is mercy for the wife and \r\n    protection for the family, and it prevents people being heedless about the \r\n    matter or toying with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is also another kind of wisdom behind it, which is that \r\n    the man may be hasty in divorcing the first time, then he may regret it and \r\n    take his wife back. Then if he divorces her a second time, he will be doing \r\n    so with insight and knowledge. Then if he divorces her a third time, that &ndash; \r\n    in most cases &ndash; will indicate that they cannot live a stable life together, \r\n    so there is no point in carrying on with this miserable life, and perhaps \r\n    separation will be a relief and mercy for both of them, as Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;B<span>ut if they \r\n    separate (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of them \r\n    from His Bounty.

So the husband is given the first divorce as a mistake, the second \r\n    as a test and the third as a separation, as the Messenger of Allah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in the hadeeth about Moosa \r\n    and al-Khidr: &ldquo;The first time was due to forgetfulness on the part of Moosa, \r\n    the second time led to the stipulation of a condition, and the third time \r\n    was deliberate. Hence al-Khidr said to him after the third time: <i>\r\n    &lsquo;<span>This is the parting \r\n    between me and you&rsquo; [al-Kahf 18:78]<\/span><\/i><span>.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>End quote from <i>at-Tahreer wa&rsquo;t-Tanweer<\/i>, \r\n    5\/415&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ibn al-Humaam al-Hanafi (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said: He may have false feelings that he does not need her \r\n    (his wife) any more, or that there is a need to leave her, then this idea \r\n    may take hold of the individual, but when the divorce takes place, he may \r\n    regret it and feel distressed and become impatient (to take her back). \r\n    Therefore Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, ordained that divorce may \r\n    be done three times, so that he might test himself the first time.

We do the latter, because if \r\n    we were to follow the opinion that a divorce uttered by one who is angry \r\n    does not count as such, there would be many who would say, &ldquo;I was angry and \r\n    I issued a divorce,&rdquo; without differentiating between the first and second \r\n    degrees (of anger).

It is for this \r\n    reason that issuing a fatwa in all cases saying that divorce issued by one \r\n    who is angry does not count as such would lead to uttering divorce becoming \r\n    widespread. But if we think that the husband is a righteous man who could \r\n    not be heedless, in that case we may issue a fatwa that the divorce does not \r\n    count as such, but if we thinks that he is heedless and wants his wife to \r\n    come back to him by any means, then in this case we should issue a fatwa \r\n    stating that the divorce does count as such. This comes under the heading of \r\n    handling each case on its merits, which is very important in sharee &lsquo;ah. \r\n    Perhaps we may prevent one man from eating a specific food, even though it \r\n    is halaal, because it will harm him, but we would not prevent another man \r\n    from eating it, because it will not harm him.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>ash-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i>, 13\/29&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10283","question_id":"10283","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not essential for \r\n    divorce to be written down or recorded; divorce takes place as soon as the \r\n    words are uttered.

Hence \r\n    it is forbidden to take them as a jest as it is also forbidden to engage in \r\n    a tahleel marriage (in which an irrevocably divorced woman marries another \r\n    man with the intention of getting divorced so that she can go back to her \r\n    first husband). This is indicated by the words of Allah (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And treat not the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Baqarah 2:231]<\/i>. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon) said: &ldquo;What is wrong with people who play with the limits of Allaah \r\n    and take His verses (laws) as a jest, and one of them says, &lsquo;I divorce you, \r\n    I take you back, I divorce you, I take you back&rsquo;?&rdquo; Thus it is established \r\n    that tampering with them (the laws and limits set by Allah) is haraam.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 6\/65&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The hadeeth was narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2017; classed as \r\n    hasan by al-Busayri in <i>az-Zawaa&rsquo;id<\/i>; classed as da&lsquo;eef by al-Albaani \r\n    in <i>Da&lsquo;eef Sunan Ibn Maajah<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, your father does not have the right to pretend \r\n    to divorce when he does not really want to divorce in a real sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, this pretence is a trick to consume wealth \r\n    unlawfully.

There is no husband but \r\n    someone else is better than him and more perfect than him, because there is \r\n    no limit to perfection.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you are seeking of life filled with faith, righteous \r\n    deeds and virtues, you can obtain by striving hard and seeking the means \r\n    that will help you to attain that, such as finding righteous friends, \r\n    attending lectures and seminars, taking part in Qur&rsquo;aan memorisation circles \r\n    and da&lsquo;wah programs, listening to beneficial lessons, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How many women there are who are knowledgeable, have \r\n    memorized Qur&rsquo;aan and call people to Allah, whilst their husbands are \r\n    ordinary, righteous, regular Muslims. In order for you to attain these high \r\n    levels it is not essential that your husband join you in that. You do not \r\n    know, perhaps if you focus on attaining these things that will help your \r\n    husband and encourage him to join you in that. The intelligent, wise woman \r\n    can change many of her husband&rsquo;s habits and interests; what matters is that \r\n    she is trying to fulfil her duties towards him, treats him kindly and does \r\n    not cause annoyance for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for thinking about divorce and thinking that it is an easy \r\n    way out, this is a mistake that stems from hasty and wishful thinking. \r\n    Perhaps the woman may get divorced and not find the husband that she is \r\n    wishing for, or she may end up marrying a man who not as good as her first \r\n    husband. In addition to that, seeking divorce is a kind of ingratitude for \r\n    blessings and harming the husband and his family.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence Islam does not allow seeking divorce except in cases \r\n    where there is a valid reason and hardship that calls for that. Abu Dawood \r\n    (2226), at-Tirmidhi (1187) and Ibn Maajah (2055) narrated that Thawbaan (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce \r\n    when it is not absolutely necessary, the fragrance of Paradise will be \r\n    forbidden to her.&rdquo; Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for a woman to ask her husband for \r\n    divorce except for a legitimate shar &lsquo;i reason, because the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Any woman who asks her \r\n    husband for a divorce when it is not absolutely necessary, the fragrance of \r\n    Paradise will be forbidden to her.&rdquo; But if there is a legitimate shar&lsquo;i \r\n    reason, such as if she dislikes him for his lack of religious commitment, or \r\n    she dislikes him because of his behaviour and attitude, or she cannot bear \r\n    to live with him even if he is of good character and religiously committed, \r\n    then in that case there is nothing wrong with her asking for divorce. But in \r\n    this case she should separate from him by means of khul&lsquo; and return to him \r\n    what he gave her, then her marriage is annulled.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is that the wife of Thaabit ibn Qays \r\n    ibn Shammaas (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I do not \r\n    find any fault with Thaabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious \r\n    commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of kufr after becoming a \r\n    Muslim.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \r\n    to her, &ldquo;Will you give back his garden?&rdquo; Because he had given her a garden \r\n    as her mahr. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    She said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said to Thaabit: &ldquo;Take back your garden, and divorce her.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On the basis of this case, the scholars ruled that if a woman \r\n    cannot bear to stay with her husband, then the authorities should ask him \r\n    for khul&lsquo; and even order him to do that. Some of the scholars said that he \r\n    should be compelled to separate from her by means of khul&lsquo;, because in this \r\n    case he will not be harmed, because he will get what he had given to her of \r\n    the mahr, and she will be rid of him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the majority of scholars say that he should not be \r\n    compelled to separate from her by means of khul&lsquo;, but he should be \r\n    recommended and encouraged to do so, and it may be said to him: &ldquo;Whoever \r\n    gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with \r\n    something better than it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Liqa&rsquo; al-Maftooh<\/i>, 54\/6&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What appears to be the case from your words is that there is \r\n    no reason that would make it permissible to seek divorce.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So fear Allah, may He be exalted, and treat your husband \r\n    kindly.

Hence \r\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, described taking back as &ldquo;retaining&rdquo; \r\n    and leaving them as &ldquo;releasing&rdquo; them, as He says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;&hellip;and they have reached their term, then retain them in \r\n    kindness or release them in kindness&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:231]<\/i> and, in another \r\n    verse, <i>&ldquo;and then (a woman) must be retained in honour or released in \r\n    kindness&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:229]<\/i>. Marriage is broken by divorce and is \r\n    restored when the divorce is rendered null and void; taking back the wife \r\n    removes the reason for the break and stops it going all the way to \r\n    irrevocable divorce; therefore it does not require what is required to \r\n    initiate a new marriage contract.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to witnessing, there are two reports, one of \r\n    which says that it is obligatory. This is one of the two views of \r\n    ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;Then when they are about to fulfil their term appointed, \r\n    either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. \r\n    And take for witness two just persons from among you (Muslims)&rdquo; [at-Talaaq \r\n    65:2]<\/i>. The apparent meaning of the command is that it is obligatory, and \r\n    because this is for the purpose of making intimacy permissible, having it \r\n    witnessed is required as in the case of the marriage contract.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second report says that having witnesses is not required. \r\n    This is the view favoured by Abu Bakr, and was the opinion of Maalik and Abu \r\n    Haneefah, because there is no need for acceptance, so there is no need for \r\n    witnesses, as is the case with all the husband&rsquo;s rights, and that is because \r\n    with regard to that in which the guardian&rsquo;s consent is not required, it is \r\n    not necessary to have witnesses. In this case the command is understood as \r\n    meaning that it is mustahabb. However there is no difference of opinion \r\n    among the scholars that it is Sunnah to have witnesses.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 7\/403&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus you know that your husband may have taken back during \r\n    the &lsquo;iddah and that his taking back is valid, whether he took you back in \r\n    the presence of a notary or not. But if he comes after the end of your \r\n    &lsquo;iddah and claims that he took you back, he will be to provide proof, which \r\n    is the testimony of two witnesses, unless you believe his claim, in which \r\n    case you may go back to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the woman gets married after the end of her &lsquo;iddah, then \r\n    her first husband claims that he took her back without her knowledge and \r\n    provides proof of that, then she is to be returned to him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the \r\n    husband of the revocably divorced woman takes her back without her \r\n    knowledge, that taking back is valid, because it does not require her \r\n    consent and therefore it does not require her knowledge either, as in the \r\n    case of talaaq. If he took her back and she did not know, then her &lsquo;iddah \r\n    ended and she married someone else, then he comes and claims that he took \r\n    her back before her &lsquo;iddah ended, and he has proof of that, it is proven \r\n    that she is his wife and the second marriage is invalid, because he (the \r\n    second husband) married the wife of another man. So she is to be returned to \r\n    the first husband, whether the second husband consummated the marriage with \r\n    her or not. This is the correct opinion and it is the view of most of the \r\n    fuqaha&rsquo;, including ath-Thawri, ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i, Abu &lsquo;Ubayd, and ashaab ar-ra&rsquo;y. \r\n    It was also narrated from &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A second report was narrated from Abu &lsquo;Abdillah (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on him): if the second husband has consummated the marriage with \r\n    her, then she is his wife and the first marriage becomes invalid. This was \r\n    narrated from &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), and it \r\n    is also the view of Maalik.

But \r\n    if it was only official proceedings to sign the legal divorce, and you only \r\n    wrote the word divorce without uttering it, or you instructed your lawyer to \r\n    take care of this official paperwork only, then it depends on your \r\n    intention. If your intention in doing that was actually to divorce your wife \r\n    or you instructed the lawyer to actually make it happen, then divorce has \r\n    taken place. In that case you have divorced your wife twice, so it is \r\n    permissible for you to take her back so long as she is still in the &lsquo;iddah \r\n    period. If the &lsquo;iddah has ended, then it is permissible for you to marry her \r\n    with a new marriage contract and mahr, but it is essential to note that if \r\n    another divorce takes place after that, then your wife will become \r\n    irrevocably divorced from you, and it will not be permissible for you to \r\n    marry her again until after she has been married to another man in a genuine \r\n    marriage, not a tahleel marriage (one intended to make it permissible for \r\n    her to go back to the first husband) and that marriage has been consummated, \r\n    then he (the second husband) divorces her or dies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you wrote the word of divorce in this request that you \r\n    filed with the court but did not intend to divorce your wife by writing it, \r\n    and you did not instruct the lawyer to actually make divorce happen on your \r\n    behalf, then divorce has not taken place, as we have explained in detail, \r\n    quoting the words of the scholars, in fatwa no.\r\n    [fatin]72291[\\fatin].

This is a mistaken notion and the fact that it is mistaken is \r\n    indicated by the hadeeth which was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, which says \r\n    that a man said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I have relatives with whom I uphold \r\n    the ties of kinship but they cut me off; I treat them well but they mistreat \r\n    me; I am patient with them but they treat me in an ignorant manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If it is as \r\n    you say, then it is as if you are stuffing hot ashes [in their mouths], and \r\n    you will have with you [an angel] from Allaah to support you against them so \r\n    long as you continue to be like that.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2285). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In this hadeeth, a man came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) complaining of his relatives&rsquo; bad treatment \r\n    of him, and in his complaint he mentioned something similar to what you have \r\n    mentioned: he upheld the ties of kinship but they cut him off, he treated \r\n    them well but they treated him badly.

The Qur&rsquo;aan &ndash; which is the word of Allaah &ndash; \r\n    urges us to think, in more than one verse, for example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;&hellip;and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and \r\n    the earth, (saying): Our Lord!

Do these situations deserve all the \r\n    time that you are spending on thinking about them? If the answer is yes, \r\n    then there is no problem! But if the answer is no, then you yourself are \r\n    admitting that they do not warrant that, and then you are halfway to solving \r\n    the problem, which is to identify the problem and take a decision concerning \r\n    it. Because when we know what the problem is, it is easy for us to find the \r\n    right way of dealing with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Overcoming these problems needs some discipline and some \r\n    time. You can make the decision to start and you are able, with the help and \r\n    support of Allaah, to do that. You have to trust yourselves in this regard!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; I suggest to you that you divide your concerns and \r\n    problems into three categories or levels:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Concerns and problems that have \r\n    a direct impact upon your married and social lives in a serious manner that \r\n    may lead to breakdown in relationships. These must be given their due \r\n    measure of objective thought and you should try to reach an agreement and \r\n    settle the matter. They should not be ignored for so long that it becomes \r\n    too difficult to deal with them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The second level is concerns or \r\n    problems in which the positive and negative aspects are equal and in which \r\n    you are involved. In these cases you should pray istikhaarah to Allaah, and \r\n    it is o.k. to consult others concerning them and to weigh up alternatives, \r\n    then decide what you think is the solution, bearing in mind issues of \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah and custom, without going to extremes in worrying about it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The third level is concerns and \r\n    worries that do not concern you at all, because they have to do with other \r\n    people. It is better not to get involved in them and waste your time with \r\n    them, because they simply do not concern you and your opinion does not \r\n    matter.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; The concerns and matters of our daily lives inevitably \r\n    fall into one of three categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Matters which are in the past \r\n    and are over and done with. We should not worry about these too much, except \r\n    to the extent from which we can learn from our mistakes and experiences when \r\n    dealing with things in the future. The past cannot come back and there is no \r\n    need to worry about things that are over and done with.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Matters which lay ahead in the \r\n    future. It is more appropriate not to think about these a great deal before \r\n    they happen, because the future is part of the unseen, and all that we have \r\n    to do in this case is to examine the choices we have in this matter if it \r\n    comes to pass. When the time comes, we have to put our trust in Allaah and \r\n    take a decision.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Matters of day-to-day life. \r\n    This is where we attempt to weigh up all the available alternatives, and it \r\n    is o.k. to consult others with regard to these things and to exchange ideas \r\n    without going to extremes or worrying too much. In the end, things will turn \r\n    out as we hope, by Allaah&rsquo;s leave, so long as we pursue the means of praying \r\n    istikhaarah and consulting others, and good lies in that which is chosen by \r\n    Allaah.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; Getting used to this requires some discipline. You could \r\n    agree with your husband to cooperate in this matter and remind one another \r\n    when you are worrying more than you need to about a matter.

Allaah has entrusted him with something and he \r\n    has neglected that trust. What he should have done was to stay with his \r\n    children in order to discipline them, look after them and take care of their \r\n    affairs. Perhaps it is your father&rsquo;s leaving that made your sisters&rsquo; \r\n    behaviour even worse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So we advise you, first of all, to convince your father, as a \r\n    matter of necessity, to come back to his wife and children, so that he can \r\n    take care of them and discipline them, or for all of them to join him in \r\n    Pakistan &ndash; even if that is done by force or by trickery &ndash; and perhaps that \r\n    would be better, because your staying in that land where there is kufr, \r\n    evildoing and moral laxity is what is affecting your sisters&rsquo; attitude and \r\n    behaviour.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your mother, likewise, has to fear Allaah with regard to her \r\n    daughters and not give them free rein. Now she has taken on a heavy burden \r\n    of responsibility, especially since your father has left. So she should not \r\n    take things lightly with regard to her daughters. Your mother has to realize \r\n    the seriousness of what your sisters are doing and the damage their actions \r\n    may do to all of you in this world, and the sin which will be upon them in \r\n    the Hereafter and upon those who approved of their actions or who allowed \r\n    them to do that and made it easy for them to do evil actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to be patient and to give thought to every action \r\n    before you do it. Staying with them is not entirely good, and leaving them \r\n    is not entirely good. Rather the matter depends on the effects of your \r\n    staying and the effects of your leaving. If your staying in the home will \r\n    affect your religious commitment and your sanity, and make you fall into \r\n    sin, then we advise you to leave. If your leaving will make their behaviour \r\n    worse and your staying will not affect your religious commitment and sanity, \r\n    then it is haraam for you to leave, because your leaving may make the sin \r\n    worse, which would mean that you were neglecting your responsibility and \r\n    being careless about that which has been entrusted to you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps this is a test from Allaah for you, to expiate for \r\n    your bad deeds and to raise you in status, not a punishment. Hence we advice \r\n    you to be patient, not to make any hasty decisions, to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and to \r\n    beseech your Lord to guide your sisters to be good and chaste. We advise you \r\n    to look for means of guiding them such as getting them married, looking for \r\n    good sisters for them to mix with, moving house, and so on. Perhaps when \r\n    Allaah sees that you are sincere, He will help you and will guide your \r\n    sisters and your mother, and will unite the family in religious commitment \r\n    and goodness. For He is able to do that and He is the Guide to the Straight \r\n    Path.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We will tell you the following story, from which you may \r\n    learn a lesson:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I used to call my \r\n    mother to Islam when she was a mushrikah. I called her one day and she said \r\n    something about the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) that I did not like to hear. So I went to the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) weeping, and said, \r\n    &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I have been calling my mother to Islam, but she \r\n    refuses.

Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.&rdquo; The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \r\n    &ldquo;O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.&rdquo; I went out feeling optimistic \r\n    because of the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the Prophet of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him). When I came home and reached the door, I saw that it \r\n    was slightly ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said, &ldquo;Stay where you \r\n    are, O Abu Hurayrah!&rdquo; and I could hear the trickling of water. She took a \r\n    bath and got dressed, and put on her headcover, then she opened the door and \r\n    said, &ldquo;O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, \r\n    and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger!&rdquo; I went back to \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \r\n    and I came to him weeping with joy. I said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, rejoice, \r\n    for Allaah has answered your prayer and guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah.&rdquo; \r\n    So he praised Allaah and said good words. I said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, \r\n    pray to Allaah to make my mother and me beloved to His believing slaves, and \r\n    to make them beloved to us.&rdquo; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;O Allaah, make this slave of Yours &ndash; \r\n    meaning Abu Hurayrah &ndash; and his mother beloved to Your believing slaves, and \r\n    make the believers beloved to them.&rdquo; So there are no believing people who \r\n    hear of me even though they do not see me, but they love me.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Narrated by Muslim, 2491<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10314","question_id":"10314","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no problem that cannot by solved by anyone, as \r\n    stated in the question. For every problem there is a solution, but the \r\n    problem is not in finding the solution, rather it depends on the one who is \r\n    going to implement the solution. Many of those who go through difficult \r\n    circumstances and ask for a solution imagine that the person they are asking \r\n    is able to take away the problem, but this is not correct. Rather all that a \r\n    human being can do is to suggest the best possible ways of reaching the \r\n    desired result, but the person must still make the effort to solve his \r\n    problem &ndash; this is very important and essential.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what you asked about:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This dislike that they are showing may be based on incorrect \r\n    ideas about you, so perhaps it is only temporary and may disappear if you \r\n    try hard to be pleasant to them. I say this because we cannot be sure of \r\n    what may happen in the future. How often has a girl have been disliked by \r\n    her husband&rsquo;s family in the beginning, then as they got to know her and saw \r\n    her good manners and good attitude, they changed their minds about her and \r\n    their condemnation turned to praise and their hatred to love.

Pay a great deal of attention to his \r\n    parents, and take care of his mother as if she were your own mother. If she \r\n    comes to your house, try to meet her with a friendly and smiling face, and \r\n    do not pay too much attention to your husband whilst she is there with you, \r\n    because this may stir up feelings of jealousy, which are very strong in \r\n    human beings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Turn to Allaah and make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and ask Him to help you to \r\n    treat them well and to soften their hearts and make them love you. Realize \r\n    that no matter how hard you look for a solution, help is ultimately in His \r\n    hand. So turn to Him with all sincerity.

If you are worried that the presence of \r\n    that non-mahram man will be a cause of fitnah or may make her do something that Allaah has forbidden, then you must not allow your wife to travel \r\n    with them.

The regrettable consequences of such actions are greater than can be enumerated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The one who brings in a servant also commits \r\n    other haraam actions, such as bringing her from her country without a mahram; causing her to be alone with non-mahram men in rooms and houses; and \r\n    looking at her and vice versa.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence our scholars have warned against \r\n    employing servants except in cases of necessity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We should not employ female or male servants \r\n    except in cases of necessity. That is because bringing these servants involves spending money that a person does not need to spend. It was proven \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting money.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some of them are not honest enough to deserve \r\n    the trust we place in them, hence I say that we should not bring male or female servants from abroad unless the following conditions are met:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to women:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The female servant should have a mahram with \r\n    her, because it is not permissible to bring her to the country otherwise. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;No \r\n    woman should travel without a mahram.&rdquo; If a woman is brought in and has no mahram with her, this is going against the prohibition of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There should be a need for her services. If \r\n    there is no need and the only reason for bringing her here is to live a life of luxury and have no obligations, or to make life easy for his wife \r\n    even though the housework is not much, then the issue is subject to further discussion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The third condition:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There should be no fear of fitnah \r\n    (temptation). If a man fears that he or one of his sons &ndash; if he has sons &ndash; may be subject to temptation, then it is not permissible for him to \r\n    expose himself to that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fourth condition:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She should adhere to what is required of her \r\n    of hijab, so she should cover her face and not uncover it. It is not correct to quote as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and \r\n    protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for \r\n    necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over \r\n    Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their \r\n    husband&rsquo;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&rsquo;s sons, or their brothers or their brother&rsquo;s sons, or their sister&rsquo;s sons, or their (Muslim) \r\n    women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [al-Noor 24:31]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>and it is not correct to interpret that as \r\n    meaning that it is permissible for a female servant to uncover her face in front of her male employer, because the one who hires a servant does \r\n    not own her (as in the case of a slave); rather she is a hired worker employed by him, and a hired worker is like any other non-mahram female when \r\n    it comes to hijab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fifth condition:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He should not be alone with her. If there is \r\n    no one else in the house with him, it is not permissible for him to employ her at all. If there are other people in the house with him but the \r\n    household members go out from the house and leave him alone with this servant, that is not permissible, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No man should be alone with a woman unless her mahram is present.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>As&rsquo;ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i>, \r\n    no. 619&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He also said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Bringing a female servant from her country without a mahram is haraam, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No woman should travel alone without a mahram.&rdquo; But if she is already in the country and \r\n    he brings her to work as a servant in his house, if she is going to come to the house, do what is needed then go back to her own house, there is \r\n    no doubt that this is permissible, but if she is going to stay in his house, this is a dangerous matter, especially if he has adolescent sons, for \r\n    then there is the fear of immorality as has happened on some occasions. But if he does not have adolescent sons, then we hope &ndash; in sha Allaah &ndash; \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to avoid that and for her to stay elsewhere and come to do her work in the morning or \r\n    afternoon and then go back.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>As&rsquo;ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i>, \r\n    no. 526.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In conclusion: because of the shar&rsquo;i \r\n    restrictions that we have noted above, and because there is no need in your case &ndash; since the parents do not want to bring a servant &ndash; then we do \r\n    not advise the brother to bring a servant.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10323","question_id":"10323","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with you happening to mention to your \r\n    mother whilst you are talking to her that your husband is thinking of taking \r\n    a second wife, and telling her that he has valid reasons for doing so, such \r\n    as not having any children from you, or that he is not satisfied with one \r\n    wife, and so on.

This applies to one who does not pray at \r\n    all. But some of the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) thought that a \r\n    person who fails to pray one prayer on time also becomes a kaafir. See <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i>, 3\/354). This points to the seriousness of the matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have done your duty towards your wife by guiding and \r\n    advising her, and this has borne fruit. Even though it may be incomplete, it \r\n    is still a positive step which indicates that there is goodness in your wife \r\n    and that she is prepared to change the rest. Yes, that may be slow but it is \r\n    possible. You see that in the beginning she was not convinced of hijaab and \r\n    did not wear it at all, but after the noble efforts on your part she has \r\n    started to wear it partially. Even though it is not full hijaab as it should \r\n    be worn, it still gives us hope and points to hidden goodness in her. You \r\n    can bring it to the surface so that she will wear proper hijaab on the basis \r\n    of conviction and her own desire to do it, as time goes by and as you \r\n    continue your efforts. This means that you must continue to advise her and \r\n    not give up, and you will be rewarded for that. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If one man were to be guided at your \r\n    hands, that will be better for you than red camels [i.e., the best kind].&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Always remind her of Allaah and make her fear Him; tell her \r\n    of the importance of prayer in Islam and that she has to learn the things \r\n    that have to do with prayer, such as the rulings on menstruation and \r\n    post-partum bleeding, because it is obligatory on every woman, when her \r\n    bleeding stops, to hasten to do ghusl when the time for prayer comes. Try to \r\n    bring her useful books on that topic, such as the essay by Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) on &ldquo;The Natural Blood of Women&rdquo; or \r\n    some useful tapes.

But if the mistakes do not \r\n    change the meaning , such as reading &ldquo;ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem&rdquo; as &ldquo;ar-Rahmaan \r\n    ur-Raheem&rdquo;, this does not invalidate the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim must learn to read Qur&rsquo;aan so that he can recite \r\n    it correctly, and so that he will not distort the Qur&rsquo;aan without \r\n    realizing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to help her with that, either by teaching her \r\n    yourself, or by showing her things that will help her, such as tapes of the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan by readers who are known to recite well.

Allaah said to His Prophet, \r\n    the noblest of all creation (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and \r\n    verily, they (too) will die&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Zumar 39:30]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Everyone shall taste death. And only on \r\n    the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is \r\n    successful.

This fear is that which makes a man keep away from \r\n    sin and persist in praying for forgiveness and repenting. As for the kind of fear that makes a person panic, expect the worst and feel helpless, \r\n    and discourages him from taking any action and prevents him from doing his duties, this is a negative and blameworthy kind of fear. The one who \r\n    feels this has to strive hard to rid himself of it and put a stop to it. Perhaps this is what the questioner is feeling, and he thinks that this \r\n    waswasah (whisper from the Shaytaan) is a warning of danger and a sign that the end is near. But this is not the case. All it is, is a whisper \r\n    from the accursed Shaytaan, to cause distress to the believer and to make his life a misery, and there is nothing real behind it. This is why, \r\n    when you went to the hospital for tests, they showed that you are in good health, which should make you feel better and give you peace of mind. \r\n    Perhaps we can help you by telling you how to get rid of this waswasah (whisper from the Shaytaan), in the following ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Firmly implanting in your heart the \r\n    belief that whatever Allaah wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen.

Your appointed time will never come until Allaah \r\n    wills it, at the time that is known to Him, and you can never bring it forward, whether you fear death or not, whether you think about how your \r\n    end will be or not. This is contrary to the life of peace, stability and tranquility that Allaah wants for the believers. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Whoever works righteousness &mdash; whether \r\n    male or female &mdash; while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, \r\n    contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in \r\n    the Hereafter)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nahl 16:97]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Remembering the kindness and mercy of Allaah towards His believing slaves, for He is \r\n    Loving, Compassionate and Forgiving, the One Whose mercy prevails over His wrath, Who blesses the sinner with abundant forgiveness.

Once you have resolved \r\n    to do that, then do not look back. If you feel that these whispers are overwhelming you again, then turn to Allaah and seek refuge in Him. Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And if an evil whisper comes to you from \r\n    Shaytaan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allaah.

If all the people thought in this way no one would have any peace of mind. But praise be to Allaah Who has \r\n    guaranteed provision for everyone.

The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;The martyrs are five: those who are stabbed, those who die of a stomach disease, those who drown, those who are crushed by \r\n    falling walls, and those who die in battle for the sake of Allaah.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 615).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Look at those who die by drowning, or by \r\n    fire, or who are crushed by falling walls.

But that does not indicate that they are bad, rather the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called them martyrs (shuhada&rsquo;), which is the utmost honour. The way in which a person dies \r\n    does not indicate that he is bad, but Allaah in His wisdom decrees that some people should die in this manner. Perhaps that is in order to raise \r\n    them in status in Paradise, or to expiate for some of their sins, or for some other reason that we do not know.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We ask Allaah to guide you to good deeds and positive thinking.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10329","question_id":"10329","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Praise be to Allaah Who has guided you to Islam.

By doing that you are \r\n    strengthening the ties of Islamic brotherhood. We hope that Allaah will reward you for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You have explained this young man&rsquo;s \r\n    situation, and we will reply in the following points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; In this dunya (this world &ndash; the name in \r\n    Arabic carries connotations both of that which is close and that which is base and vile), a man&rsquo;s life is not consistent, rather his circumstances \r\n    will vary between that which he likes and that which he does not like.&nbsp; The wise man, when he thinks about this world, will realize that he needs \r\n    to develop an optimistic outlook and put an end to worries and distress that could disturb him and cause him stress. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>What the Shaytaan wants to do is to cause the \r\n    Muslim grief and stress. Being introverted and thinking constantly about pain and sorrow gives the Shaytaan a great opportunity and may cause the \r\n    worries and stress to multiply. Looking forward to a happy life and being optimistic is one of the means of feeling content and at peace. It is \r\n    known that this world is a mixture of ease and hardship, joy and sorrow, hope and pain, so why should a person help the dark side to prevail over \r\n    the bright side?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Wisdom dictates that if a man cannot make \r\n    optimism prevail, then at the very least he should think in a balanced and objective manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Feelings of stress and that life is too hard \r\n    do not control a man's mind unless there are reasons that provoke these kinds of feelings. Rather they are indicative that the relationship \r\n    between a person and his Lord is not sound. The more a man turns to Allaah and focuses on Him, the more he will feel a sense of peace and comfort, \r\n    to an extent that no one knows except Allaah. Hence those who know Allaah, are close to Him and fear Him are the happiest of people, to such an \r\n    extent that one of them said, in a well known expression: &ldquo;If the kings and the sons of kings knew what joy we have, they would fight us for it \r\n    with the sword.&rdquo; This is also what is expressed in the Qur&rsquo;aan, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Whoever works \r\n    righteousness &mdash; whether male or female &mdash; while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in \r\n    this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used \r\n    to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nahl 16:97]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But feeling stressed is a kind of wake-up call that alerts a person to check on his \r\n    relationship with his Lord, because sins may have the effect of making a person feel scattered and unfocused. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;But whosoever turns away from My Reminder \r\n    (i.e. neither believes in this Qur&rsquo;aan nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the \r\n    Day of Resurrection&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Ta-Ha 20:124]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is a great deal of goodness in the \r\n    young man whom you are asking about, for he is a person who is keen to seek knowledge, and he does naafil acts of worship such as fasting, and he \r\n    upholds ties of kinship with his aunt. However you must draw his attention to the fact that he has to check on his relationship with Allaah, for \r\n    there may be some sin that is preventing him from achieving this sense of happiness, some sin that he has committed with regard to the rights of \r\n    Allaah or the rights of others. So encourage him to repent and seek forgiveness a great deal, especially since you said that he sometimes sleeps \r\n    and misses the prayer &ndash; this is a serious matter although many people take it lightly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It may be that this test of this person \r\n    through disasters and calamities is something that has been decreed by Allaah for him in order to raise him in status, if he persists in obeying \r\n    what Allaah has commanded, which is to be patient and accept whatever Allaah decrees. Everything that Allaah decrees for a believer is good for \r\n    him and his affairs, both spiritual and worldly. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;How wonderful is the affair \r\n    of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one except a believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for \r\n    it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is also good for him.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, \r\n    2999)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If something bad happens to a believer, he \r\n    either bears it with patience or panics. If he is patient he earns a great reward and accepts the will and decree of Allaah, because he knows that \r\n    it comes from Allaah, so he feels content with it and accepts it. So what reason is there to panic and feel stressed?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On the contrary, if he is not patient and he \r\n    reacts to what befalls him of sin with panic and anger, and worry and stress, he will lose the reward that Allaah has promised to those who are \r\n    patient. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Only those who are patient shall receive \r\n    their reward in full, without reckoning&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Zumar 39:10]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He should sincerely turn towards Allaah and \r\n    call upon Him (du&rsquo;a&rsquo;), beseeching Him to relieve him of this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) and seeking refuge in Him a great deal from the \r\n    accursed Shaytaan. For it annoys the Shaytaan to see a believing slave feeling peace of mind and contentment, so he whispers to him to distract \r\n    him from that and make him fearful and confused. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) taught us a du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; by which we may ward off worries and distress.

Perhaps Allaah will reform him, especially \r\n    if he has asked you to stay with him and to wait for him. The fact that you \r\n    have children together may also make you think more carefully before you ask \r\n    for a divorce, because it is better for children to be raised with both \r\n    their father and their mother than for them to be raised by one parent \r\n    only.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the man is sincere in his repentance and his regret (of \r\n    the past), then it is better for you to be patient and to wait until he \r\n    comes out of prison, because that is in his interests and in the interests \r\n    of your children, and also in your own interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if you cannot bear to be patient and to stay without a \r\n    husband for this length of time (one year), or if the man is not sincere in \r\n    his repentance, there is no sin on you in that case if you seek a divorce, \r\n    and there is nothing good in your staying with him when he is persisting in \r\n    that sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to make a great deal of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; to Allaah, and seek \r\n    His guidance by praying istikhaarah before you take any step.

The root of the problem, in my view, is the fact that the \r\n    husband was not able to see his fianc&eacute;e fully in the manner prescribed in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, by sitting with her &ndash; but not being alone with her, of course &ndash; \r\n    and looking closely at her and even asking to see her again at another time. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, you made a great mistake when you felt put off by this \r\n    girl at the time of engagement but you went ahead with the marriage.&nbsp; It \r\n    would have been better for you not to take a risk in such matters, because \r\n    the one who wants to get married should feel completely at ease with his \r\n    choice and not hesitant, so what about one who feels discontent as in your \r\n    case?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The real problem you face now is that this girl loves you and \r\n    respects you, and she is giving you all your rights and more.

Hence you have your share of blame and \r\n    you have to bear part of the consequences of this matter, even if only a \r\n    little. You have to face up to the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Try to live with this girl and put up with her as much as \r\n    possible. At least wait until the child is born, and perhaps things will \r\n    change and your hatred will turn to love.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; If your circumstances allow you to keep her whilst \r\n    looking for another wife who will make you happy and let you stay with your \r\n    first wife, and you can look after your children with her and spare them the \r\n    pain of separation and divorce, this is something that is worth thinking \r\n    about.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; If the solutions suggested above will not work; if the \r\n    matter is beyind your control and your hatred for her increases and you are \r\n    no longer able to live with her, then divorce is allowed in sharee&rsquo;ah in \r\n    such cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The bitterness of divorce will be easier for her than the \r\n    ongoing misery of living with you, and perhaps she will find a husband with \r\n    whom she can be happy. And perhaps you will also find a wife with whom you \r\n    can be happy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Divorce &ndash; even though it is disliked &ndash; is the solution when \r\n    husband and wife cannot live amicably together.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Try to think about these solutions, and think long and hard \r\n    about them.

If it is accompanied by actually committing \r\n    immoral actions, then it is even worse, because of the sin and abhorrent \r\n    nature of those immoral actions and their bad consequences in this world and \r\n    in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence you should focus on \r\n    how to treat this perversion and save yourself from this destructive evil, \r\n    more than focusing on whether to conceal it from your fianc&eacute;e or disclose it \r\n    to her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You should realize that \r\n    there are causes for this calamity, and these causes may be due to what the \r\n    person affected has done. The one who wants to save himself from this \r\n    situation should examine these causes and rid himself of them, and do what \r\n    we advise, otherwise he is approving of and accepting his condition and he \r\n    does not want to change for the better. Among the causes which may be due to \r\n    his own actions are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Weakness of faith and \r\n    remoteness of the heart from love of Allaah, and a lack of fear of His \r\n    punishment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Looking freely at beardless \r\n    youths, and enjoying their beauty and form.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is the first step \r\n    towards sin for those who are affected by this disease. Allaah has enjoined \r\n    lowering the gaze and refraining from looking at haraam things, and the \r\n    Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has enjoined \r\n    likewise. When he stopped following this command and began to do that which \r\n    is forbidden, Iblees was able to shoot his poisoned arrow into his heart, \r\n    and thus destroy him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: Looking is the origin of most of the problems that \r\n    befall man, because looking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate \r\n    ideas, and ideas generate desires, and desires generate will, which then \r\n    becomes stronger and becomes firm resolve, in which case the deed will \r\n    inevitably be done unless there is something to prevent it. Hence it was \r\n    said that patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience in bearing \r\n    the pain that comes afterwards. End quote from <i>al-Jawaab al-Kaafi<\/i> (p. \r\n    106).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence the scholars are \r\n    unanimously agreed that it is haraam to look at beardless youths, and some \r\n    of them regard that as more haraam than looking at women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: Similarly the scholars forbade a man to look at the \r\n    face of a beardless youth if he is handsome, whether with or without desire, \r\n    and whether it is free of fitnah (temptation) or there is the fear thereof. \r\n    This is the correct view which was favoured by the scholars. This was stated \r\n    by al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and the prominent scholars of his madhhab (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on them). The evidence for this is that a beardless youth is, in some \r\n    ways, like a woman; he may be desired as a woman is desired, and his form \r\n    may be beautiful like that of a woman, and many of them may be more \r\n    beautiful than many women. The prohibition applies more to them for another \r\n    reason, which is that in their case there may result from attachment to them \r\n    types of evil that do not occur in the case of women.

If he looks at his mother, \r\n    sister or daughter with pleasure derived from looking like the pleasure \r\n    derived from looking at a non-mahram woman, then it is known to everyone \r\n    that this is haraam.

He must acknowledge the Oneness of his Lord (Tawheed) and His laws \r\n    and verses first of all, then he should do acts of worship, both inward and \r\n    outward, which will distract his heart from always thinking of this thing, \r\n    turn to Him a great deal and beseech Allaah to take this away from him. He \r\n    should focus his heart on Him.&nbsp;There is no better remedy for it than \r\n    sincerity towards Allaah. This is the remedy that Allaah mentioned in His \r\n    Book when He said (interpretation of the meaning): <i>\r\n    &ldquo;<\/i><\/span><i>Thus it was, that We might turn away \r\n    from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse.

If that were the case, then Allaah \r\n    would not have told the people of Loot to repent, and the Prophet of Allaah \r\n    Loot (peace be upon him) would not have called them to give up their \r\n    perversion. Allaah is the Creator of man, and He knows what can be changed \r\n    in man and what cannot, so do not pay any attention to any claim that is \r\n    contrary to that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>How many homosexuals have \r\n    turned to their Lord and repented, and their repentance has been accepted \r\n    and they have changed their ways, and their haraam desires have disappeared. \r\n    Loot (peace be upon him) called on his people to marry, because that is an \r\n    effective remedy, in which the one who is affected by this thing can direct \r\n    his desires in the permissible manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>From the above it is clear \r\n    that what the homosexual falls into of being attached to images of beardless \r\n    youths, or evil immoral actions, is the result of his deeds (and he is to \r\n    blame). He is required to give it up, and he can rid himself of that. If we \r\n    assume that he feels attracted to men, then he must resist that and avoid \r\n    the causes that may lead to him falling into haraam, just as a normal man is \r\n    naturally attracted to women, but he is required to lower his gaze and not \r\n    be alone with a woman, and he must avoid all the means that lead to fitnah \r\n    (temptation).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for your saying &ldquo;what \r\n    should we do?&rdquo;, we have explained to you what you should do. You should fear \r\n    Allaah and respect Him so much that you do not want Him to see you in the \r\n    bad situation which He dislikes for you, and for which He gives people a \r\n    painful punishment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But what we are really \r\n    shocked by is what you say after that: &ldquo;Is it our fault that we are like \r\n    that? What is the wisdom behind a man being created like this?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Yes, O slave of Allaah, the \r\n    blame and consequences, the threat and punishment, all befall the one who \r\n    commits the sin; he deserves it because of the evil acts that he has done \r\n    and what his hands have earned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And among men is he who \r\n    disputes about Allaah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light \r\n    (from Allaah),<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>9.&nbsp;Bending his neck in \r\n    pride (far astray from the path of Allaah), and leading (others) too (far) \r\n    astray from the path of Allaah.

This &ndash; praise be to Allaah &ndash; will not harm the believer. Hence the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when some of \r\n    his companions complained to him about the waswasah (whisperings from the \r\n    Shaytaan) that they were encountering: &ldquo;Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most \r\n    Great, Allaah is Most Great.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There are two blessings which \r\n    many people do not make the most of and thus lose out: good health and free \r\n    time.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6412.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Teebi said: The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened the Muslim \r\n    (who is accountable for his deeds) to a merchant who has capital and seeks \r\n    to make a profit whilst also preserving his capital. The way to do that is \r\n    to look for the right people to deal with and he himself will be honest and \r\n    will try to be smart lest he be cheated. Good health and free time are our \r\n    capital, and we should deal with Allaah with faith, striving against the \r\n    evil inclinations of our nafs and the enemy of religion i.e., the Shaytaan, \r\n    so that we may attain the best in this world and in the Hereafter. This is \r\n    similar to what is mentioned in the passage where Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>Shall I guide you to \r\n    a trade that will save you from a painful torment?<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Saff 61:10]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We should avoid following the dictates of the nafs and keep \r\n    away from the Shaytaan lest we lose both our capital and our profit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> by Ibn Hajar.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If time is so important, \r\n    then the Muslim should not have any free time, for he should be going from \r\n    one act of worship and obedience to another. If he cannot spend all his time \r\n    going from one act of obedience and worship to another then, he may spend \r\n    some of his time in permissible pursuits, in which he should ensure that his \r\n    intention is correct, so that he may earn reward thereby, as Mu&rsquo;aadh (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;I get up and I sleep, and I hope for the \r\n    same when I sleep as I hope for when I get up.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, \r\n    6923; Muslim, 1854.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The problem that the sister is suffering from is caused by \r\n    several things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: she does not understand the value of time. This is \r\n    true of many people, as stated above. Even worse than that, by neglecting \r\n    this great blessing, her spare time has become something destructive, and \r\n    she regards it as an enemy that she wants to kill, but she does not realize \r\n    that she is killing herself. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: she feels depressed. There is no doubt that wasting \r\n    one's time and one's life causes deep depression in man, because he feels \r\n    that he is like an animal that eats so it can sleep, and sleeps so it can \r\n    eat. Hence we see many disbelievers ended their life by suicide, after being \r\n    afflicted by depression and other incurable diseases &ndash; may Allaah keep us \r\n    safe and sound from that with which He has tested them. One of the primary \r\n    causes of depression is disobedience towards Allaah. Undoubtedly wasting \r\n    time watching TV leads a person to commit sin, such as watching and \r\n    listening to haraam things, wasting time, and other things caused by this \r\n    evil machine. The benefits that the sister gains by joining a halaqah for \r\n    memorizing Qur&rsquo;aan are largely cancelled out, if not erased entirely, by \r\n    sitting in front of the TV. Just as good deeds erase bad deeds, bad deeds \r\n    cause good deeds to be lost.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    [You can refer to the \r\n    Books section of this website; in\r\n    <a> <i>\r\n    Dealing with Worries and Stress<\/i> <\/a>you will find more details about the \r\n    causes of worry and how to overcome them.

For (reading) each letter is a hasanah, and \r\n    each hasanah brings a tenfold reward. And each verse raises one in status \r\n    and increases one&rsquo;s reward, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Read and rise (in status), for as you used to \r\n    recite in this world, your position (in the Hereafter) will be determined by \r\n    the last verse you read.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1464; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>al-Saheehah<\/i>, 2240.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Adopt a cause affecting Muslim \r\n    women in the country where you live, such as helping to teach Muslim girls, \r\n    undertaking charitable projects, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Find good and righteous friends \r\n    with whom you can meet and get together.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Read Islamic books in \r\n    particular and useful stories in general.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Get involved in da&rsquo;wah, women&rsquo;s \r\n    activities and children&rsquo;s sports in Islamic centres.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Listen to tapes and lectures, \r\n    and write summaries which you can distribute to those who will benefit from \r\n    them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Learn some useful areas of \r\n    worldly knowledge such as cooking, sewing, etc.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Learn about computers and \r\n    useful programs, for this is a vast area which will take up a lot of time \r\n    and can be used to do a lot of good and useful things.

Thus it \r\n    is known that the reason for allowing this is people&rsquo;s interests, and the \r\n    ruling is based on the reasons for and against. If there is an interest to \r\n    be served, then it is permissible (to keep a dog). Some interests may be \r\n    more important and greater than that of farming, and some interests may be \r\n    equal to those mentioned by the Lawgiver.

Even if a person does some bad deeds, his staying \r\n    within the circle of Islam is one of the greatest blessings that Allaah \r\n    bestows upon him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imagine that you had the best that this world has to offer: \r\n    wealth, status, a husband, children, a peaceful and stable home, education, \r\n    a life filled with happiness, and everything that you could wish for, but at \r\n    the same time you followed Judaism or Christianity or Buddhism, or you \r\n    regarded a cow as holy, as millions of people do, or you worshipped a mouse, \r\n    or the sun, or some other created thing, or that you were confused? Would \r\n    that be better, or having the problems and worries that you have, but you \r\n    are still Muslim?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You follow the Sunnah. Imagine if you claimed to be a Muslim \r\n    but you were following a wrong path. Imagine if you were a Raafidi Shi&rsquo;ah, \r\n    believing that the Qur&rsquo;aan is distorted and lacking something, and \r\n    venerating &lsquo;Ali and reviling the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them \r\n    all), regarding most of them as kaafirs and worshipping Allaah by cursing \r\n    Abu Bakr and &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them), and accusing the \r\n    Mother of the Believers &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah of zina &ndash; as millions of those who claim \r\n    to follow Islam do, but Islam has nothing to do with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or imagine that you were one of those who claim to follow \r\n    Islam but they believe that the awliya&rsquo; (&ldquo;saints&rdquo;) in their graves can being \r\n    benefit and cause harm, so they call upon them and seek their help, and \r\n    offer sacrifices to them and make offerings to them. Undoubtedly this is \r\n    blatant kufr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is a reference to just two of the seventy-two sects that \r\n    claim to belong to Islam, but they will all be in Hell except for one, as \r\n    was stated by the one who did not speak on the basis of whims and desires &ndash; \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Which is dearer to you &ndash; having this world and all its \r\n    delights beneath your feet whilst being so misguided and deviant, or being a \r\n    Sunni Muslim, in accordance with sound human nature and affirming the \r\n    Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed), even though you have many worries and \r\n    problems?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Praise Allaah for having been guided to pray and enabled to \r\n    do good deeds, for many people regard themselves as Sunni Muslims, but they \r\n    do not pray. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The covenant that distinguishes between us and them is prayer; \r\n    whoever does not pray is a kaafir.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2621), \r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i (463) and Ibn Majaah (1079); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\r\n    <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Part of being enabled to do good deeds is loving Allaah and \r\n    His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the \r\n    Sahaabah, as you mention in your letter. It is proven that our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There are three \r\n    characteristics, whoever attains them has found the sweetness of faith: when \r\n    Allaah and His Messenger are dearer to him than all else, when he loves a \r\n    man and does not love him except for the sake of Allaah, and when he would \r\n    hate to return to kufr after Allaah has saved him from it as he would hate \r\n    to be thrown into the fire.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (16) and Muslim (43).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    By the same token, love of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions is one of the greatest \r\n    means of drawing closer to Allaah, of which most of mankind is deprived. It \r\n    is narrated in a saheeh report that he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;A man will be with those whom he loves.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (6169) and Muslim (2640) from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood; also \r\n    narrated by Muslim (2639) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are great blessings, just one of which cannot be traded \r\n    for this world and its pleasures and delights, but in fact you are not aware \r\n    of their true value, because you have not experienced being without them, \r\n    even for a single day, and you did not see their fruits in the world except \r\n    on a very small scale.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not underestimate the severity of the problem from \r\n    which you are suffering, but exaggerating about things may make a single \r\n    problem into several problems. In fact you have several problems, so how \r\n    about if you were to exaggerate about each one of them until they became \r\n    like many problems?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Looking at a problem from only one angle generates worry, \r\n    distress and depression, and if it is minor it will increase in one&rsquo;s eyes \r\n    until one thinks that all the problems of the world are on one&rsquo;s shoulders, \r\n    and there is no problem that a Muslim could have that is one hundred percent \r\n    pure evil? In most cases the good that exists in the calamity is many times \r\n    greater than the bad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: Do you know that Allaah tests the believing woman \r\n    because He loves her and wants what is good for her? In <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> it \r\n    is narrated that our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;When Allaah wills good for a person, He tests him.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (5321).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What great grace it is that Allaah cleanses His slave whom He \r\n    loves of sin straight away, with trials and calamities, so that he will meet \r\n    Him on the (Day of Resurrection) with no sin on him, and his joy on that Day \r\n    will be great, and he will realize then that the calamities that befell him \r\n    were among the greatest blessings that Allaah bestowed on him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;On the Day of Resurrection, when people who had suffered affliction \r\n    are given their reward, those who were healthy will wish their skins had \r\n    been cut to pieces with scissors when they were in the world.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Tirmidhi, 2402. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Look again at the life that you are living, and at the \r\n    calamities that you are suffering, and think positively of your Lord, for He \r\n    is the wisest of the wise, may He be glorified.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Try as much as you can to look at the positive side of every \r\n    problem that you are suffering, whether it is psychological or material. For \r\n    example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Delay in marriage:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How many girls find that marriage for them is delayed, then \r\n    it turns out to be good for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There was a woman who reached the age of forty; her sisters \r\n    and brothers all got married, and her parents died, and she stayed in the \r\n    house alone. She was religiously committed and righteous. A woman said to \r\n    her: May Allaah help you to cope with this loneliness; you have stayed alone \r\n    after all your family has gone. And she started to encourage her to be \r\n    patient. But she gave an amazing response that not even great and prominent \r\n    people could come up with, and those who heard this answer were stunned by \r\n    it. She said: Who told you that I am living alone? Not at all. I have not \r\n    lived a single day without the one I love. He is with me night and day, and \r\n    He does not leave me for a moment, and I talk to Him at moments when He is \r\n    closest to me. He is my Lord. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example is the problem of not having children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of our sisters got married but did not have children for \r\n    many years, then she found out from medical tests that she was the one who \r\n    could not have children. She gave her husband the choice of divorcing her or \r\n    taking a second wife to live with her like two sisters in one house. He \r\n    loved her for her religious commitment and righteousness, so he chose to \r\n    take another wife and to keep her with him as a co-wife with all the rights \r\n    of marriage. That was done, and she now had some free time. She joined a \r\n    group of women to memorize Qur&rsquo;aan, until she had memorized it all, and she \r\n    earned a certificate in learning and memorizing Qur&rsquo;aan. Then she began to \r\n    study and she took a course in fiqh and another in &lsquo;aqeedah. Now she is a \r\n    teacher of women in a women&rsquo;s centre, and she has had the honour of \r\n    introducing the Sunnah to many areas that were dominated by innovations and \r\n    myths. She has played a major role in eradicating ignorance for many women \r\n    who used to worship Allaah in ignorance. She bore her inability to have \r\n    children with patience, and her Lord honoured her, and her use of her free \r\n    time had a great impact on her and others with regard to knowledge and \r\n    education.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A third example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This has to do with one of the greatest problems from which \r\n    you are suffering, which is sihr (magic or witchcraft), and the influence of \r\n    the jinn and practitioners of witchcraft among mankind. This example will \r\n    give answers to most of the questions that have to do with this topic.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There was a girl from a good and religiously committed \r\n    family. The family was faced the problem that the wife of one of their sons \r\n    practised witchcraft. She had an argument with her husband&rsquo;s sister and put \r\n    a spell on her so that suitors would be put off and to make her appear ugly \r\n    when first seen, so that the suitor would not return. That happened many \r\n    times despite the fact that she was notably beautiful, and that went on for \r\n    a long time. Then she was treated with shar&rsquo;i ruqyah to combat witchcraft \r\n    and the effects of witchcraft became apparent on her.&nbsp; She was treated for a \r\n    while, to no avail. Every time she thought that the problem had been solved, \r\n    she would suddenly find that she was suffering from the same spell, and she \r\n    suffered the same as you are suffering now, worry, stress and depression.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    She started to wonder, could people hate another for no \r\n    reason to such an extent that they would cause harm to one another, and the \r\n    witchcraft and the jinn started causing her to panic by night and day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then she referred her problem to a specialist who told her: \r\n    There are ten things that you must adhere to, and by Allaah&rsquo;s leave this \r\n    problem will not last for long if you are patient and put up with it for a \r\n    little while. You do not need to go to a man to treat you with ruqyah, \r\n    rather you can treat yourself by yourself. She said: I will be patient and I \r\n    will do my best, if Allaah wills. So he wrote down the ten points for her \r\n    and she adhered to them and stuck firmly to them. Here are the ten points; \r\n    we will write them for you and we ask Allaah to enable you to adhere to them \r\n    as part of the remedy for several problems that you have, of which sihr is \r\n    one. These are the ten points:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Read whatever you can of \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan every day.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; during the last third of the night, beseeching \r\n      Allaah to grant you relief.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Seek out the times when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are answered, and say \r\n      du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; at those times, such as when prostrating, between the adhaan and \r\n      iqaamah, and before saying the tasleem at the end of the prayer.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Always recite the adhkaar for morning and evening, even \r\n      during your menses.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Pay attention to specific du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s, such as dhikr when \r\n      entering the house, when entering the toilet, when exiting, when going to \r\n      sleep, when waking up, and on various occasions. These are explained in a \r\n      small book that is of great benefit, namely <i>Husn al-Muslim<\/i> by \r\n      Shaykh Sa&rsquo;eed ibn Wahb al-Qahtaani. (Available in English as <i>Fortress \r\n      of the Muslim<\/i>).<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Keep away from sin, avoid negligence and shun the \r\n      situations which may cause you to forget remembrance of Allaah, because \r\n      they are places where the devils gather and take advantage of the heedless \r\n      and overwhelm them with desires.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Try to help those who are in distress and relieve their \r\n      distress, in the hope that Allaah may relieve your distress thereby. If a \r\n      person helps his brother, Allaah will help him, and if he relieves his \r\n      brother&rsquo;s distress, Allaah will relieve his distress.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Pray for those who are in distress, asking Allaah to \r\n      relieve them, because that will lead to the angels praying for you as you \r\n      prayed for others.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Ask a great deal for forgiveness.<\/li>\r\n      <li>\r\n      Recite the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of distress at various times: &ldquo;<i>La \r\n      ilaaha ill-Allaah al-&lsquo;Azeem ul-Haleem, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah Rabb il-&lsquo;arsh \r\n      il-&lsquo;azeem, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah Rabb is-samawaati wa Rabb il-ard wa Rabb \r\n      il-&lsquo;arsh il-kareem<\/i> (there is no god except Allaah, the All-Mighty, the \r\n      Forbearing; there is no god except Allaah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne; \r\n      there is no god except Allaah, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth and \r\n      Lord of the noble Throne).&rdquo;<\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;After nearly a month of adhering to these things, Allaah \r\n    took away her distress and decreed that she should be healed and made well. \r\n    It was only a few days later that a suitor came to her and she got married. \r\n    And now she has three sons and lives a calm and stable life filled with \r\n    spiritual and worldly delights.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The last example, which I pray Allaah will cause to be a \r\n    lesson and example for you:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There was a girl from a family that was not religiously \r\n    committed. She married an uneducated young man who was somewhat religiously \r\n    committed but was a little careless with regard to some matters of \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. She got pregnant a few months after marriage and the pregnancy \r\n    lasted for a while, then she had a miscarriage. She and her husband grieved \r\n    deeply, but a few months later she got pregnant again. The pregnancy lasted \r\n    for a few months, but ended in miscarriage like the first one. The grief the \r\n    second time was greater. They started going to doctors to find out the \r\n    causes, and the problem was diagnosed. In the third pregnancy she took the \r\n    medicines that were needed to make the pregnancy stable, but one month later \r\n    she had a miscarriage despite taking all the necessary precautions. The \r\n    grief this time was far greater than the first two times. They lost trust in \r\n    that doctor and looked for another who was more skilled, but it happened \r\n    again and she had another miscarriage. Each of them started looking for a \r\n    remedy and asking, and they were sent to a Shaykh who treated people by \r\n    means of ruqyah. He told her: You are under a powerful spell, and this is \r\n    what is causing the miscarriages, and needs several sessions. That was done \r\n    but to no avail. Then she went to a second Shaykh, and a third and a fourth. \r\n    Every time she was partially cured, then the effects of the spell came back \r\n    again.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The couple began to despair and they almost gave up. There \r\n    was no joy in their lives, and they asked many of the same questions that \r\n    you mention in your letter. Why did Allaah create the jinn? Why are they \r\n    able to harm us without us being able to do anything? Why? Why? She became \r\n    depressed and that almost destroyed their marriage.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then Allaah caused her husband to meet a seeker of knowledge \r\n    and he said: Shall I not tell you that which is best for your religious and \r\n    worldly interests? The husband said: That is what I have been looking for. \r\n    He wrote down for him something similar to the ten points that we have \r\n    mentioned, and he and his wife followed that, and Allaah made things easier \r\n    for them, and relieved their distress, and blessed them with a beautiful \r\n    baby girl.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This woman went through a great test, and her children died \r\n    because of the effects of witchcraft and she spent a lot of money on medical \r\n    treatment. In the end the calamity turned into a blessing, or many \r\n    blessings. She used to delay prayer until the time for it was over, but then \r\n    she started to pray regularly on time. She used to listen to music and watch \r\n    soap operas and movies, and attend mixed wedding parties with the evils \r\n    involved in them, but now she and her husband refuse to do that until now. \r\n    She used not to pray qiyaam or read Qur&rsquo;aan or memorize it, or see knowledge \r\n    or observe naafil fasts, but now she does all of those things. Although the \r\n    problem that she was suffering ended a year ago, she began to taste the \r\n    sweetness of obedience, worship and conversing with her Lord, so she decided \r\n    to follow that for the rest of her life. Yes, she suffered a problem and a \r\n    calamity, but her problem became the cause of her rising in worldly and \r\n    religious terms. We ask Allaah to make us, her and you steadfast in adhering \r\n    to Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10360","question_id":"10360","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    A common mistake is for each spouse to tell the other \r\n    everything about their previous lives before marriage, on the grounds that \r\n    they should not leave anything of their past lives untold to their new loves \r\n    and should be completely frank and open, so their relationship will have a \r\n    strong foundation with nothing to affect it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Real life has shown this idea to be a failure, because in \r\n    most cases the spouses cannot stand this.

You should also pay attention to the \r\n    fact that when a person grows older, their reasoning diminishes and they \r\n    become childlike in many ways. You should also remember that you are dealing \r\n    with your husband&rsquo;s mother, and usually mothers-in-law feel as jealous of \r\n    their sons&rsquo; wives as they would of a co-wife.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you pay attention to all of the above, then your problems \r\n    will begin to seem insignificant and your worry will be dispelled. What you \r\n    are suffering from is something that many women suffer from, and it needs \r\n    two important things: patience and wisdom.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So bear with patience whatever you see and hear from your \r\n    husband&rsquo;s family, and be wise in your dealings with them, especially with \r\n    your husband&rsquo;s mother, for by means of your wisdom you will be able to avoid \r\n    many problems and you will earn their approval or at least put a stop to \r\n    their ill will towards you; and you will also win your husband&rsquo;s heart and \r\n    please him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Wisdom in your dealings with your husband&rsquo;s mother means that \r\n    you must speak nicely to her, praise her, pray for her, respond to her \r\n    requests and be more concerned about her than she is herself, if she takes \r\n    medicine, for example, or she has an appointment to visit a doctor. Gifts \r\n    also play a major role in softening her heart and changing the way she deals \r\n    with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it should also be noted that you are not obliged to serve \r\n    her or take care of her in the sense of it being an Islamic obligation. What \r\n    you are doing is something that is mustahabb and is liked in Islam, and it \r\n    is also kindness towards your husband. Perhaps if she realizes that you are \r\n    doing something that is not obligatory upon you in sharee&rsquo;ah, and your \r\n    husband realizes that also, this will elevate your status in their eyes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This does not mean that you should go along with her in \r\n    gheebah or backbiting when she does that; rather you should advise her to \r\n    stop eating the flesh of people by backbiting them. If she stops, that will \r\n    be better for her, and you will have the reward for that, but if she \r\n    continues and does not pay attention, then it is not permissible for you to \r\n    sit with her when she is backbiting about others. Rather you must leave her \r\n    company and your doing this may play a role in her stopping backbiting. It \r\n    is not sufficient for you to denounce it in your heart in this case, because \r\n    you do not come under the heading of being forced to do it. It is essential \r\n    for her and her son to understand this ruling, and you should understand \r\n    that if you stay with her when she is doing that, then you are a partner \r\n    with her in the sin of backbiting, so how about if you join in with them by \r\n    speaking?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have every right to have a separate house in which you \r\n    live with your husband and children, and you have the right to privacy, if \r\n    your husband wants you to live with his family, and he will not be \r\n    disobeying his mother if he allows you that. The wise and intelligent man \r\n    weighs things against the standards of sharee&rsquo;ah, and gives each person who \r\n    is entitled to rights his or her due, and he does not take away from one in \r\n    order to give to another.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But despite that we know how difficult it is to live \r\n    separately in many cases, especially in current circumstances when finding \r\n    suitable accommodation, especially in the big cities, is very difficult to \r\n    achieve. In this case the man must look at his circumstances in general with \r\n    an open mind, so that he will not make things difficult for himself or for \r\n    the people around him. Allaah has decreed proficiency in all things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your husband has to understand the reality of your situation \r\n    with his mother, because this is causing you to be edgy, which is affecting \r\n    your children. It may also be affecting your husband. Hence he should hasten \r\n    to solve the problems in his household, and he should accept frank \r\n    discussion with you in all matters. He has to bear the responsibility that \r\n    Islam has enjoined on him, and he has to honour his family, which also \r\n    includes advising them and reminding them if they do something that is \r\n    contrary to sharee&rsquo;ah. He is also responsible for treating his wife kindly \r\n    and he is responsible for raising his children. He is in great need of \r\n    someone who can discuss these matters frankly with him and help him, and you \r\n    are the main support who can help him in all these matters. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to guide you and set your affairs straight, and \r\n    to reconcile between you, and to make you a happy family in this world and \r\n    in the Hereafter.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10363","question_id":"10363","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We understand the extent of the problem that you are \r\n    suffering and the extent of the pressure you are facing to give up your \r\n    religion and your commitment. This problem is not yours alone, rather it is \r\n    a problem faced by thousands of Muslims who want to adhere to the teachings \r\n    of this great religion, and want to live a moral life of honour and \r\n    chastity, but they face many problems in their societies that, \r\n    unfortunately, have deviated from Islam to a large extent and now look down \r\n    upon and scorn those who adhere to Islam, and governments that cause trouble \r\n    for those who are committed to Islam. Everyone knows what is going on in \r\n    your country, the war against Islam and those who are committed to it.

Did you \r\n    ever experience any hardship? He will say: No, by Allaah, O Lord. I never \r\n    saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship.&rdquo;.

We have no power to change from one state to another, from \r\n    disobedience to obedience, from imperfection to perfection, except with the \r\n    help and guidance of Allaah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it is essential to seek the help of Allaah first and last. \r\n    In Soorat al-Faatihah which the Muslim recites several times each day, it \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;You (Alone) we worship, and You \r\n    (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)&rdquo; [al-Faatihah 1:5]<\/i>.&nbsp; \r\n    We cannot worship Allaah unless Allaah enables us and helps us to do that. \r\n    Among the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the people of Paradise are the words (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;All the praises and thanks be to \r\n    Allaah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, \r\n    were it not that Allaah had guided us&rdquo; [al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:43]<\/i>. \r\n    And among the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) were the words: &ldquo;Do not leave me to myself even for the \r\n    blink of an eye.&rdquo; <i>Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah<\/i> (226).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it is essential to seek the help of Allaah, rely on Him \r\n    and be aware that all things are in His hand, and with the word &ldquo;<i>Kun<\/i> \r\n    (Be!)&rdquo; He does whatever He wills.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So seek the help of Allaah and delegate your affairs to Him, \r\n    and trust that Allaah will grant you a way out: <i>&ldquo;And whosoever puts his \r\n    trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him&rdquo; [al-Talaaq 65:3]<\/i>. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Constant du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Say du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; a great deal, asking Allaah to make things easier \r\n    for you, to help you to do all that is good, to guide and to keep evil and \r\n    its people away from you. &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) used to say: &ldquo;I am not worried whether Allaah will respond, but I am \r\n    worried about whether I will be able to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, because if I am helped \r\n    to du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, then the response will come with it.&rdquo; Du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; relieves distress \r\n    and takes away worry. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;There is no Muslim who says a du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in which there is no sin or \r\n    severing of family ties, but Allaah will give him one of three things: \r\n    either He will hasten to answer his prayer, or He will store it up for him \r\n    in the Hereafter, or He will divert an equivalent evil from him.&rdquo; They said: \r\n    Then we will say a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;! He said: &ldquo;Allaah can give more than that.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (10794), classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Targheeb<\/i> (1633). The one who says du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is always in a good state, \r\n    no matter how much du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; he says, for Allaah is greater in goodness, \r\n    blessing and grace.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Worship, especially prayer&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to pay attention to acts of worship, for they will \r\n    revive the heart and alert the one who is negligent, and they are among the \r\n    most important factors of steadfastness and the best help in achieving one&rsquo;s \r\n    goals, after the help of Allaah, may He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The greatest act of worship is prayer, for it is the main \r\n    foundation of faith after the shahaadatayn and it is the foundation of \r\n    Islam. The heart has no life without prayer. It brings relief from all \r\n    worries and hardships. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) used to say to Bilaal: &ldquo;Let us find rest in it (the prayer), O \r\n    Bilaal.&rdquo; <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i> (4985). So pray, and focus with proper \r\n    humility, and ponder, and weep, and relieve yourself of the worries and \r\n    stress of this world.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash;Reading the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Read the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan regularly, and have a portion of it \r\n    that you read every day, and do not neglect it. You should also have a brief \r\n    Tafseer (commentary) that will help you to understand and ponder the \r\n    meanings of the verses, such as <i>Tafseer al-Sa&rsquo;di<\/i> or <i>Aysar \r\n    al-Tafaaseer<\/i> by Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Jazaa&rsquo;iri.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing greater than the words of Allaah, and there \r\n    is no exhortation more eloquent than the exhortation of Allaah. There is no \r\n    book that can offer guidance or relief from worry like the Qur&rsquo;aan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Adhkaar and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Always recite the adhkaar that are narrated from the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at various times and on \r\n    various occasions, such as the adhkaar for morning and evening, when going \r\n    to sleep and when waking up, when eating and drinking, when going out of the \r\n    house and when coming in, and in all situations. Be certain of the \r\n    importance of understanding their meanings. Among the useful books on this \r\n    topic are: <i>al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah bi Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah<\/i> \r\n    by Ibn &lsquo;Allaan. This is a valuable book from which you can learn the \r\n    meanings of the adkhaar, so that hearts may be revived and become connected \r\n    to the Knower of the Unseen.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; Listening to useful lectures and khutbahs&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Continue to listen to useful lectures and khutbahs, for you \r\n    always need someone to remind you, guide you and advise you. From lectures \r\n    etc you can learn a great deal about the rulings of Islam and how to behave \r\n    at times of crisis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; It is essential to read and learn.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is essential for you to learn, read and educate yourself \r\n    in Islamic matters, for &ldquo;whomever Allaah wills good to, He causes him to \r\n    understand Islam&rdquo;, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. So it is \r\n    essential to know and understand the rulings of Islam. In many cases where \r\n    things seem difficult and complicated, if a person learned the rulings or \r\n    asked the scholars, he would find it easy and not complicated. There may be \r\n    a concession of which he is not aware, or there may be an alternative in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah that would make it easier for him. Among the useful books that we \r\n    advise you to read is <i>Fiqh al-Sunnah<\/i> by Shaykh Sayyid al-Saabiq [this \r\n    is available in English translation under the title Fiqh us-Sunnah, \r\n    published in 5 volumes by American Trust Publications,&nbsp; Plainfield, IN]; <i>\r\n    al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi<\/i> by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan; <i>&lsquo;Awdat al-Hijaab<\/i> \r\n    by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ismaa&rsquo;eel. You can also learn from useful Islamic \r\n    websites.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should also read modern history, especially that of your \r\n    own country, and how Islam has been fought, and what their plots were, for \r\n    if the Muslim understands that, it will inspire him to face the challenge \r\n    and make him adhere to Islam even more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; With regard to marriage&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is undoubtedly very important, and will bring many \r\n    benefits in your case, such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Psychological stability, peace \r\n    of mind and tranquillity.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>By Allaah&rsquo;s leave, it will be a \r\n    means of reducing the social and family pressures on you, because you will \r\n    be able to move to a new home, away from your family and neighbours and the \r\n    society which is placing many restrictions on you that you cannot overcome.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>You will be able to raise \r\n    righteous offspring in an atmosphere of chastity, trust, modesty and \r\n    adherence to this religion, the upbringing that many of us have missed out \r\n    on, unfortunately.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A person can do with his children that which he wishes that \r\n    his parents had done with him. Raising righteous offspring is one of the \r\n    most important benefits of marriage. The ummah is waiting for you and others \r\n    like you who love this religion and want to adhere to it. They are waiting \r\n    for righteous, believing offspring from you, through whom Allaah will \r\n    benefit the ummah and change it for the better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are many other benefits that you will attain through \r\n    marriage, hence we emphasize the importance of this issue. Based on the \r\n    circumstances that you are suffering, the advice which we have to offer you \r\n    is: if there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character \r\n    you are pleased, do not hesitate to accept, and if there is no such person \r\n    then be content with one who is &ldquo;semi-committed&rdquo;, for if we cannot find that \r\n    which is perfect we must be content with the best that is available, even if \r\n    it is not perfect. This advice is just for you, based on your particular \r\n    situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not mean by this that you should be content with an \r\n    evildoer or one who drinks alcohol, not at all. Rather what we mean is one \r\n    who is righteous in general terms, who prays regularly and loves Islam in \r\n    general, one who is of good character and chivalrous, who feels protective \r\n    jealousy with regard to matters of honour, even if he has some other \r\n    faults.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You could encourage him to improve, by means of your \r\n    personality, your powers of persuasion and your wisdom in dealing with him, \r\n    after Allaah guides you and him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not agree that your going to websites is the last hope \r\n    for you, rather hope never ceases. The Muslim always has hope and expects \r\n    good from his Lord, and he thinks positively of his Lord Who says in the \r\n    hadeeth qudsi: &ldquo;I am as My slave thinks I am.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari and \r\n    Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9 &ndash; With regard to the problem of hijab and your not being \r\n    able to wear it&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once again, we state that we understand the extent of the war \r\n    that you are facing in your country because of hijab, hence we think that \r\n    there is no reason why &ndash; given your particular circumstances &ndash; you should \r\n    not take a gradual approach to wearing hijab. What your parents and society \r\n    may not accept today, they may accept gradually after a month or two, or a \r\n    year.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to dress as modestly as possible, and try hard to \r\n    cover your head. Wear clothes that are loose, then when the people get used \r\n    to your dressing modestly, you can take another step forward, until you are \r\n    wearing full hijab as Allaah has enjoined upon the believing women and as \r\n    you yourself want and enjoyed wearing in the land of the two sacred mosques \r\n    during your visit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But do not be too hasty. Take it slowly, and you will attain \r\n    what you want, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is not the best way that the Muslim should follow, but \r\n    it is acceptable in cases of necessity and in the particular circumstances \r\n    that you are in. Attaining part of a thing is better than nothing, and \r\n    reaching perfection slowly is better than losing everything. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10 &ndash;With regard to prayer&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam after the \r\n    Shahaadatayn. It is the connection between a person and his Lord, so you \r\n    should pay a great deal of attention to it and it is essential to offer \r\n    prayers regularly, at the proper times.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, As&#8209;Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the \r\n    believers at fixed hours&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:10]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not think there is any problem with regard to Fajr and \r\n    &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, or with Maghrib during the summer, when the time for Maghrib begins \r\n    an hour or two after you come back from work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, there is no excuse for delaying these prayers \r\n    beyond the proper time, so strive hard to offer these prayers at the time \r\n    decreed for them in sharee&rsquo;ah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That leaves Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, and also Maghrib during the \r\n    winter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle &ndash; as stated above &ndash; is that you should \r\n    offer each of them at the proper time, so look for a time when the place for \r\n    doing wudoo&rsquo; is free of men. If that is not possible, there is nothing wrong \r\n    with entering the washroom and doing wudoo&rsquo; in there, and wudoo&rsquo; done there \r\n    will be valid. In most cases its floor &ndash; even if it is wet &ndash; will be taahir \r\n    (pure) and the water that is on it will be taahir, so there is nothing wrong \r\n    with doing wudoo&rsquo; in there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When praying, a woman is required to cover all of her body \r\n    except her face and hands. If you cannot wear clothes like that for the time \r\n    being, then keep a hijab or other garment for prayer in your office, that \r\n    you can wear at the time of prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no special place where prayers must be performed, \r\n    rather prayers may be offered anywhere, so you can wait for a chance when \r\n    you are alone in your office, and then pray.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is too difficult and you cannot offer every prayer on \r\n    time, then we hope that you will have a concession allowing you to join Zuhr \r\n    and &lsquo;Asr, so you can delay Zuhr until the time of &lsquo;Asr and pray them \r\n    together, but that is subject to the condition that it is done before the \r\n    time for &lsquo;Asr ends, and that is half an hour or forty-five minutes before \r\n    sunset. If that is not possible, then you have a concession allowing prayer \r\n    until sunset, but there is no excuse for delaying &lsquo;Asr until after sunset.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to Maghrib in the winter, if you can do it at \r\n    work then this is what you must do, and if that is not possible then you may \r\n    delay it and join it with &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; at the time of the latter, and you can pray \r\n    Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; together when you go back home.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Remember that if you do that, you are not delaying the prayer \r\n    beyond its proper time, because joining Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr, and Maghrib and \r\n    &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, is permissible in cases of necessity and in order to ward off \r\n    hardship, whether one is travelling or not, unlike shortening the prayers, \r\n    which is not permitted except when travelling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But you must try hard to offer every prayer at the proper \r\n    time, and the Muslim should always be able to find a way. A senior military \r\n    figure was unable to ask for permission to pray, lest he be accused of \r\n    fundamentalism or terrorism and be put under watch, so he used to ask \r\n    permission to go to the bathroom, where he would do wudoo&rsquo; then go and pray, \r\n    and come back.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not think that you are incapable of coming up with some \r\n    way and finding an opportunity to offer every prayer on time. If you cannot, \r\n    then join Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr as described above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, we would draw your attention to the fact that many \r\n    of the problems that you are facing at work, such as delaying the prayers \r\n    and not being able to wear hijab, are due to your working in a place where \r\n    you mix with men.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A woman&rsquo;s working in a place where she mixes with men, with \r\n    no shar&rsquo;i guidelines, leads to many negative consequences, as is obvious to \r\n    you. Hence the wisdom of Islam dictates that this is haraam. If you can move \r\n    to another department or another job where there are no men, this will solve \r\n    your problems at work to a great extent, or you can choose to stop working \r\n    altogether, unless you are facing pressure from your family to carry on \r\n    working, in which case we hope that you have a concession to allow you to \r\n    continue, whilst trying to avoid the bad things as much as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, we will be happy to keep in ouch with you and offer \r\n    advice, and&nbsp; we will be even happier to hear that you have acted upon this \r\n    advice and that you have taken steps in the right direction.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you to do all \r\n    that is good, and to divert all evil away from you, and to bless you with \r\n    righteous offspring.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the source of strength and the Guide to the \r\n    right path.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10364","question_id":"10364","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It should be noted, first \r\n    of all, that Allaah has enjoined you to respect your parents and to treat \r\n    them kindly in word and in deed, and He has forbidden you to treat them \r\n    badly or say to them &ldquo;Uff&rdquo; (a word of disrespect).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And your Lord has \r\n    decreed that you worship none but Him.

He said: &ldquo;Your mother.&rdquo; He said: Then who? He said: &ldquo;Then \r\n    your mother.&rdquo; He said: Then who? He said: &ldquo;Then your mother.&rdquo; He said: Then \r\n    who? He said: &ldquo;Then your father.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5626) and Muslim \r\n    (2548).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence you must stop your \r\n    mistreatment and saying that she is insane, because that is not appropriate, \r\n    and you should treat her in a kind and loving manner, and do not disobey her \r\n    commands so long as there is no sin involved. It is not permissible for you \r\n    to shun her and stop talking to her.

By \r\n    Allaah, it fills the heart with sorrow to hear that there is such severe \r\n    suffering and pain in Muslim families for the one who wants to adhere to his \r\n    religion and straight path. We have often heard of Muslim men and women who \r\n    suffer because of their Christian or idol-worshipping families, but for a \r\n    Muslim woman to suffer because of her family who claim to be Muslims and to \r\n    flee from her so-called Muslim family for the sake of her religious \r\n    commitment is something that is very sad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to make you and your husband steadfast in \r\n    adhering to Islam and true guidance, and to make you strong in adhering to \r\n    the truth, and to make you righteous and bless you with righteous \r\n    offspring.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslim narrated in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> (145) that Abu Hurayrah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Islam began as something strange \r\n    and will revert to being something strange, so glad tidings to the \r\n    strangers.&rdquo; If the people regard you as strange because of your religious \r\n    commitment, then glad tidings to you. If the Muslim sees that he is a \r\n    stranger because of his Islam, even among his family, then this is glad \r\n    tidings for him that the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) conveyed to him: &ldquo;Glad tidings to the strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There can be no doubt that reviling the Lord and Islam, as \r\n    done by your mother and other family members, is major kufr that puts a \r\n    person beyond the pale of Islam and dooms them to Hell for eternity, if the \r\n    one who did that dies without coming back to Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence your duty towards those among your family who have \r\n    fallen into such sins is to call them to refrain from this kufr and tell \r\n    them that they must come back to Islam, and they should understand their \r\n    situation and the Islamic ruling on their case, which is that they are \r\n    apostates whose good deeds have been cancelled out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should realize that the fact that your mother has fallen \r\n    into kufr does not mean that you should sever your relationship with her, \r\n    rather you should be more concerned about it lest she die in this state.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to honour her and treat her kindly even if she is a \r\n    kaafir and, moreover, even if she calls you to kufr and strives hard to do \r\n    that, as our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his \r\n    parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything \r\n    (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-&lsquo;Ankaboot 29:8]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in \r\n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them \r\n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Luqmaan 31:15]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her) said: My mother came to me when she was a mushrik.

These \r\n    reasons include the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The mother&rsquo;s strong \r\n    personality, and her husband&rsquo;s weak character, so that she is the one who \r\n    makes decisions in the home, and she wants to transfer this to her \r\n    daughter&rsquo;s home too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash;Weak character of both \r\n    her daughter&rsquo;s husband and her daughter, which gives the mother the \r\n    opportunity to play a major role in directing the affairs of her daughter&rsquo;s \r\n    household. The mother thinks that running the household needs a strong hand \r\n    and that the couple are unable to run their home, so she takes charge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Impassioned feelings \r\n    towards her daughter, which makes her ask about her food, drink, medicine \r\n    and sicknesses, and how her husband is treating her; it may even make her \r\n    overstep the mark and ask about intimate details of married life, including \r\n    love and sex!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Husband&rsquo;s mistreatment \r\n    of his wife, which leads the mother to intervene in matters great and small, \r\n    so as to make the husband behave himself and ensure that the wife is given \r\n    her rights.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; Frequent visits on the \r\n    daughter&rsquo;s part to her mother, and being in touch with her a great deal. In \r\n    most of these visits etc the mother cannot find anything to talk about \r\n    except finding out what is going on in her daughter&rsquo;s house.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In order to solve the \r\n    problem of the mother interfering in her married daughter&rsquo;s life in ways \r\n    that may spoil her life, she and her husband should pay attention to a \r\n    number of things, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Direct advice from the \r\n    daughter or her husband to the mother not to interfere in their lives, \r\n    telling her that this is not permissible for her, and that this interference \r\n    may lead to the couple splitting up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Telling the father (the \r\n    mother&rsquo;s husband) that he must stop his wife from interfering in the life of \r\n    her daughter and her husband.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Hinting to the mother, \r\n    or even warning her, that if she continues to interfere in their lives, then \r\n    the husband will stop her from visiting her daughter or getting in touch \r\n    with her, and he will also stop his wife and children from visiting her \r\n    mother. This will clearly demonstrate the strength of character of the \r\n    husband and wife, and it will prevent the mother from interfering in a \r\n    negative way in their lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; It is essential that \r\n    the couple work out together how to deal with this problem and that neither \r\n    of them tries to solve it on his or her own without the other. This problem \r\n    concerns both parties, so it needs a common strategy to deal with it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; They should consult the \r\n    mother with regard to some matters, and ask for her advice, so that the \r\n    relationship between them will remain within shar&rsquo;i limits, and so that she \r\n    will know that her involvement is not rejected completely, and that they may \r\n    need her in some cases. This will give her confidence and maintain contact, \r\n    whilst preventing negative interference.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; Reducing the number of \r\n    visits and contact with the mother, and when the visit does take place, \r\n    there should be a focus on talking about useful things, advice and reminders \r\n    to do acts of obedience, and avoid sins and bad deeds. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We ask Allaah to set your \r\n    affairs straight and to guide you all to that which pleases Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah is the Source of \r\n    strength.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10372","question_id":"10372","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the answer to questions no.

If he is honest with you and gives you this answer, then he will \r\n    have committed himself, and given evidence against himself, and this is what \r\n    you yourself have done with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We advise you not to criticize him too much, and to discuss \r\n    with him. You can go to a scholar or seeker of knowledge whom he trusts to \r\n    discuss the matter with him, and hear something from someone other than you \r\n    who has knowledge that will put his mind at rest. You do not have to be the \r\n    one who advises him, changes his mind and convinces him, rather you should \r\n    delegate that to someone else, so that he will do that on the basis of being \r\n    pleased with what he has heard.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <b>We also advise you to stop your shunning of him straight \r\n    away, and stop refusing to treat him kindly. Right now he is in the greatest \r\n    need of you and your compassion.<\/b> He is suffering \r\n    from something that the imams and scholars also suffered from, which is the \r\n    issue of intention (niyyah). Imam Sufyaan al-Thawri (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said: I have never dealt with anything more difficult than my \r\n    intention. So beware of forsaking him, and beware of being too harsh with \r\n    him, lest you lose him forever. We ask Allaah not to let that happen.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; The second possibility is that he is lying, in which case \r\n    you have to find out whether your son has been affected by the sickness of \r\n    loss of interest and ambition. There are many causes for these sicknesses, \r\n    including the following: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Influence of bad friends<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Too many duties in school and \r\n    at home, so that he feels overwhelmed and gives up on some of them.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Finding the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    memorization program too heavy, which has led to him becoming tired and \r\n    bored.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Not having the chance to relax \r\n    in permissible ways, such as going on trips, playing games, and watching \r\n    beneficial shows. Some fathers are too keen for their children not to pay \r\n    any attention to these things that allow for relaxation and bring more \r\n    energy for worship and obedience.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (v)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Reaching the stage of puberty \r\n    and adolescence, which is a dangerous stage in a young man&rsquo;s life. Parents \r\n    must pay attention to their sons when they reach this age, and treat their \r\n    sons as men, not children, and lightening up on the things they tell them to \r\n    do. The stage of persuasion and understanding should begin, which is totally \r\n    different from when they were small.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we have mentioned are some of the possible causes. You \r\n    know what is really going on, whether he is telling the truth or lying. \r\n    Hence we said that raising children is difficult, and needs knowledge and \r\n    wisdom, patience and forbearance. It is not a simple matter, especially with \r\n    all the corrupt influences, distractions and the war against virtue, \r\n    chastity and righteousness that is being waged inside and outside. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Look for the reason why he has stopped memorizing Qur'aan and \r\n    given up his commitment. If he is telling the truth, then we have mentioned \r\n    above is the way to deal with it. If he is lying, then check on the \r\n    possibilities that we have mentioned, and seek the help of Allaah, asking \r\n    Him to guide you and help you. And do not forget to pray for your son, for \r\n    he is more in need of that than you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the experience of a famous Qur&rsquo;aan reader &ndash; Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad Siddeeq al-Manshaawi (d. 1388 AH). Read what his son Muhammad \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i wrote about him and the way he took care of his children and \r\n    taught them to memorize Qur&rsquo;aan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Professor Muhammad Husayn Ibraaheem al-Rantaawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i Muhammad Siddeeq &ndash; the name of the shaykh&rsquo;s son &ndash; \r\n    spoke of the methods of guiding and directing the children that his father \r\n    followed and said: My father was very keen that we should do the obligatory \r\n    duties, and he would often take us with him to the mosques where he read \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan. That was an opportunity for me to visit and get to know most of the \r\n    mosques of Egypt. He would also keep an eye on us when we chose our friends, \r\n    and he would insist that they come from religiously-committed families of \r\n    good character, and join his children in studying, and he would help them to \r\n    do their homework and attend parents&rsquo; meetings in the schools that his \r\n    children went to. During the summer holidays, he had us take part in sports \r\n    such as swimming and archery during the day, and at night he would read to \r\n    us the religious books that were suited to our age. Then when one of us had \r\n    acquired the habit of reading, he would supply him with books and encourage \r\n    him to read more. Before all of that came memorization of Qur&rsquo;aan, so that \r\n    even the one who had been left out because he was too small was encouraged \r\n    by his father Shaykh Siddeeq to memorize Qur&rsquo;aan, and he did that.

The accursed one wants to prevent people from doing good \r\n    whenever he finds a way to do that, and he comes to each person in the way \r\n    that is appropriate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence al-Fudayl ibn &lsquo;Iyaad (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Refraining from doing an action because of the people is \r\n    showing off, and doing it because of the people is shirk. Sincerity is when \r\n    Allaah protects you against both.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Adhkaar<\/i> by al-Nawawi (18).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that al-Haarith ibn Qays al-Ja&rsquo;fi said: If \r\n    you are doing something that has to do with the Hereafter then continue and \r\n    if you are doing something that has to do with this world then be careful. \r\n    If you intend to something good then do not delay it, and if the shaytaan \r\n    comes to you when you are praying and says &lsquo;You are showing off,&rsquo; then make \r\n    it longer. Narrated by Imam Ahmad in <i>al-Zuhd<\/i> (430), with a saheeh \r\n    isnaad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly you know the status of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), and we think that you know \r\n    that he is one of the trustworthy scholars. We believe that you respect and \r\n    admire him, and we would never misquote the Shaykh. We will let you read \r\n    what he said about a problem similar to yours and we hope that you will pay \r\n    attention to his answer and act upon it, because that will bring you \r\n    happiness and goodness in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is your advice to a seeker of knowledge who has worked \r\n    hard to correct his intention and to be sincere, but he could not manage to \r\n    do that? He is afraid that the ahaadeeth which carry a stern warning \r\n    addressed to the one whose intention is not sincerely for the sake of Allaah \r\n    alone will apply to him, and he will soon stop seeking knowledge. Please \r\n    advise us, may you be rewarded.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is an importance question for the seeker of knowledge, \r\n    for knowledge is one of the best and greatest acts of worship, which Allaah \r\n    has made equivalent to jihad for His sake, as He says, may He be blessed and \r\n    exalted (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And it is not (proper) for the believers to go out to \r\n    fight (Jihad) all together. Of every troop of them, a party only should go \r\n    forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islamic) \r\n    religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so \r\n    that they may beware (of evil)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Tawbah 9:122]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah tells us that the believers cannot all go out to fight \r\n    in jihad for the sake of Allaah; rather a few from every group should learn \r\n    the principles of the religion of Allaah, so that they may warn their people \r\n    when they return in order that they may beware (of evil), and the others \r\n    should fight for the sake of Allaah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;When Allaah wills good for a person, He causes him to understand \r\n    the religion.&rdquo; If a person thinks that Allaah has caused him to understand \r\n    his religion, then he should accept the glad tidings that Allaah has willed \r\n    good for him, and he must be sincere in his intention towards Allaah when \r\n    seeking knowledge, by having the following intentions in his pursuit \r\n    thereof:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: Obeying the command of Allaah, may He be blessed and \r\n    exalted, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;So know (O \r\n    Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) that Laa \r\n    ilaaha illAllaah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah&rdquo; [Muhammad \r\n    47:19]<\/i>. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: He started with \r\n    knowledge, before words or deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp; He should intend by his learning to preserve the \r\n    laws of Allaah, for sharee&rsquo;ah is preserved in people&rsquo;s hearts and in books.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: he should intend by his learning to protect the \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah of Allaah against its enemies, because its enemies have been \r\n    trying to undermine it since the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) was sent and they will carry on trying to do so until \r\n    the Hour begins. So by seeking knowledge let him intend to protect the great \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly: He should intend thereby to defend sharee&rsquo;ah if \r\n    anyone attacks it, and in that case he must learn the weapons with which he \r\n    will defend his knowledge. Rather we say that he should focus on the issues \r\n    concerning which the enemies of Allaah try to cause confusion, and tackle \r\n    each issue in the manner that befits it. People vary with regard to this \r\n    matter. Some people may try to cause confusion about &lsquo;aqeedah, so one needs \r\n    to learn &lsquo;aqeedah by means of which he can ward off false beliefs. Some \r\n    people may attack Islam by means of bad manners, so he has to learn good \r\n    manners and learn the consequences of bad manners, and so on. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly: The seeker of knowledge must also intend by his \r\n    pursuit of knowledge to worship Allaah in the manner that Allaah approves \r\n    of, because without learning a man cannot know how to worship Allaah whether \r\n    that is in his wudoo&rsquo;, his prayer, his charity, his fasting or his hajj. He \r\n    should also call others to Allaah with his knowledge, explaining sharee&rsquo;ah \r\n    to people and calling them to adhere to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In fact knowledge is one of the best acts of worship and one \r\n    of the greatest and most beneficial. Hence you will find the that Shaytaan \r\n    is keep to keep people from acquiring knowledge; he will come to a person \r\n    and tell him that he is seeking knowledge to show off, so that the people \r\n    will see him and think that he is a scholar, so he will lose interest and \r\n    will say: I should keep away from showing off? Or he will come to him and \r\n    tell him: Have the intention when seeking shar&rsquo;i knowledge of making some \r\n    worldly gain, so that the warning &ldquo;The one who seeks knowledge that should \r\n    be sought&nbsp; for the sake of Allaah, but he does it only for some worldly \r\n    gain, will not smell the fragrance of Paradise&rdquo; will apply to you. And he \r\n    comes to him with many things that will prevent him from seeking knowledge. \r\n    But one must seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan, and go \r\n    ahead with his plans, and not pay any attention to these whispers that enter \r\n    his heart. Every time he feels that something is distracting him from \r\n    seeking knowledge &ndash; by whatever means &ndash; he should say, &ldquo;<i>A&rsquo;oodhu Billaahi \r\n    min al-shaytaan il-rajeem<\/i> (I seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed \r\n    satan)&rdquo; and &ldquo; <i>Allaahumma a&rsquo;inni<\/i> (O Allaah, help me) and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>And I say to this student:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>Go ahead and seek knowledge, and do not let the shaytaan \r\n    keep you from remembering Allaah or seeking knowledge. Carry on even though \r\n    you will encounter difficulty and hardship in making your intention correct, \r\n    but correcting one&rsquo;s intention is something easy. Go ahead, O young man, and \r\n    seek the help of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and seek refuge \r\n    with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan.&nbsp; <\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Noor &lsquo;Ala al-Darb (al&rsquo;Ilm)<\/i>, \r\n    quoting from the website of Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We think that there is a great deal of good in you, in sha \r\n    Allaah, and that the words of the imams of knowledge and faith, and the \r\n    advice of Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) will all have \r\n    an effect on your heart, mind and life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should remember that your father does not want anything \r\n    but good for you, and that every act of worship and obedience that you do is \r\n    for you and your father. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And remember that attaining victory by the blessing of the \r\n    Qur'aan in the Hereafter will be shared between you and your parents, and \r\n    the loss caused by neglecting it will also be shared between you and them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It will be said to the companion of the Qur'aan: \r\n    Recite and rise in status, and recite as you used to recite in the world, \r\n    and your status will be at the last verse you recite.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood (1464) and classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever reads the Qur&rsquo;aan and learns it and acts upon it \r\n    will be given a crown of light to wear on the Day of Resurrection, the light \r\n    of which is like the light of the sun, and his parents will be clothed with \r\n    two suits the equivalent of which is not to be found in this world, and they \r\n    will say: Why have we been clothed with this?

If \r\n    your withdrawing is for the purpose of worship and devotion, then it has \r\n    some basis in sharee&rsquo;ah, but the kind of isolation that leads to apathy is a \r\n    haraam kind of isolation. In that case mixing with your friends becomes \r\n    obligatory, so you should pay attention to that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the words &ldquo;is it better for the one who is striving \r\n    hard to be isolated or mix with people?&rdquo;, although people disagree \r\n    concerning this issue, in whole or in part, the truth of the matter is that \r\n    mixing with people may, at different times, be obligatory or mustahabb, and \r\n    an individual may, at different times, be required to mix with people or to \r\n    isolate himself. It depends: if mixing with people will involve cooperation \r\n    in righteousness and piety, then he is enjoined to do it, and if it will \r\n    involve cooperation in sin and transgression, then he is forbidden to do it. \r\n    Mixing with the Muslims for some types of acts of worship, such as the five \r\n    daily prayers, Jumu&rsquo;ah, the eclipse prayer, prayers for rain (istisqa&rsquo;) and \r\n    so on, is something that is enjoined by Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp; The same applies to mixing with them \r\n    at the time of Hajj, when fighting the kuffaar, even if the leaders are \r\n    evildoers or there are evildoers among those groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to meetings which increase a person in \r\n    faith, either because they benefit from him or he benefits from them, and so \r\n    on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But there are times when the believer must be alone in his \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, dhikr, prayer, thinking, taking stock of himself, setting himself \r\n    straight, and private matters which have nothing to do with anyone else. At \r\n    these times he needs to be alone, either in his house &ndash;as Tawoos said: The \r\n    best cell of a man is his house, where he restrains his gaze and tongue &ndash; or \r\n    elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Choosing to mix in absolute terms is wrong and choosing \r\n    isolation in absolute terms is also wrong. So too the amount of each that a \r\n    person needs, and what is best for him in each case, is something that \r\n    depends on each person, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (10\/425, \r\n    426)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should realize that the calamities that have befallen \r\n    your heart, of resentment and envy are all connected to the situation you \r\n    are in.

When Allaah blesses a poor or lowly person with faith, \r\n    that is a test for the rich and noble. If his aim is to find the truth and \r\n    follow it, he will believe and become Muslim, and the fact that there are \r\n    poor and lowly people who are less then him in wealth and status who are \r\n    Muslim does not prevent him from embracing Islam.

So He bestows \r\n    His grace and favour upon them, and not those who are not grateful, for \r\n    Allaah is wise and does not bestow His grace on those who are not deserving \r\n    of it; those who objected do not deserve it, unlike those whom Allaah has \r\n    blessed with faith of the poor and others, who are grateful. <i>Tafseer \r\n    al-Sa&rsquo;di<\/i> (258).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you should have done was to hasten to do good deeds, and \r\n    give up evil, and compete with people in that, as the Lord of the Worlds \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;so compete in good deeds.

It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (3148).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We will tell you frankly: The remedy begins with this idea:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It starts with obeying and pleasing Allaah, may He be \r\n    glorified, because calamities start with disobedience towards Him. Allaah \r\n    has promised the penitent that He will turn his bad deeds into good ones, \r\n    and He has promised to bestow grace and reward.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Repentance starts by resolving to give up the sin that one \r\n    has committed, and to cut off all haraam ties. In your case it starts with \r\n    cancelling the mobile phone altogether, and not going back to it until your \r\n    husband agrees to buy you a new number. If you do this then you will have \r\n    proven to your husband and to yourself that you are sincere in your \r\n    repentance and your desire to mend your ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How can you want your husband to overlook the past when you \r\n    yourself have not overlooked it and are going back to it?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your husband has done you a great favour by giving you \r\n    another chance to live with him. Perhaps the real reason for that is that he \r\n    loves you, otherwise the logical sequence of events would have been for this \r\n    story to lead to scandal, separation and divorce. But Allaah has blessed you \r\n    and been kind to you, by concealing you and giving you a house and a family, \r\n    so you must show kindness to your husband in return, and observe the limits \r\n    of Allaah concerning him, and cut off all ties and all means of getting back \r\n    in touch with this man who has transgressed against you. But what you did \r\n    was to repeat the mistake and persist in sin and take the matter of \r\n    repentance lightly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Do you expect that after that you will helped to change for \r\n    the better?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How can you allow yourself to listen again to the voice of \r\n    that young man and receive messages from him again? How can you go back to \r\n    burdening your husband with the stress of waswaas that affects every man who \r\n    sees something suspicious on his wife&rsquo;s part? How can you expect him to \r\n    trust you again when you have not shown yourself to be trustworthy? We \r\n    affirm to you that continuing in this manner will lead to a greater loss \r\n    than that which you are facing now. Think about your situation if your \r\n    husband tells your family about what you are doing. Undoubtedly the stress \r\n    you will face will be worse than what you are facing now.&nbsp; We urge you to \r\n    mend your ways as it is essential. You have already made a good start, but \r\n    you have a long way to go. We advise you to fear Allaah and be keen to take \r\n    care of your house, husband and family. Do not pay attention to anything but \r\n    seeking the pleasure of Allaah; let that be your concern. Be steadfast and \r\n    do not despair. Keep trying and do not stop treating your husband kindly and \r\n    obeying him in that which is good and proper. Do not be put off by your \r\n    husband&rsquo;s bad treatment. If you are sincere towards Allaah in adhering to \r\n    His laws, He will set things straight for you with your husband, even if it \r\n    is after a while; He will restore the happiness you seek and will ward off \r\n    all temptation and misery from you. What does anyone want in life but a \r\n    quiet life in good health as a true slave of Allaah? If Allaah blessed a \r\n    person with any of that, let him strive to protect the blessing by giving \r\n    thanks for it and fearing Allaah with regard to it. Contentment is a \r\n    treasure that never fades away.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah for guidance, help and happiness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10377","question_id":"10377","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Western societies have become the worst disgrace in human \r\n    history, with perverted and deviant behaviour and corruption of human \r\n    nature. &ldquo;Sexual madness&rdquo; has become the preoccupation of all classes of \r\n    society, and not even their children in their homes or schools are safe from \r\n    them. Conferences are being held and resolutions are being passed about the \r\n    &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of spreading &ldquo;sex education&rdquo; in the schools of those deviant \r\n    societies. They are not content only to corrupt themselves, but they are \r\n    also hastening to spread it to the Arab and Muslim countries so that they \r\n    will follow in their footsteps of temptation and perversion, so some of \r\n    those who were deceived by them followed them in that, and Allaah saves \r\n    whomever He wills by His guidance and help.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who wants to save himself and his family should not \r\n    agree to be a part of those societies, or to live among them, and he should \r\n    refuse to take part in what they are doing of haraam things, evils and \r\n    perversions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Wise people in those societies have spoken of the necessity \r\n    of separating male and female students in schools. They have seen the many \r\n    evils that result from this mixing, and some of them attribute those evils \r\n    to moral corruption, and others to education. Whatever the case, mixing in \r\n    such places is forbidden in our sharee&rsquo;ah.

Numbers have reached remarkable levels, \r\n    and this situation has led to the involvement of some educationalists to put \r\n    a limit on this matter, but how could these wise people reform a sex-crazed \r\n    society?&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The ratio of illegitimate children has risen to a dangerous \r\n    level. The government office of statistics in France states that the number \r\n    of illegitimate births rose to more than half of all births in France in \r\n    2006 (50.5 %), for the first time in the country&rsquo;s history. Similar \r\n    situations are developing in Britain and America.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There has been an increase in cases of rape among students. \r\n    There are many well known cases, and this matter is no secret to anyone, \r\n    rather the nightmare of rape haunts all female students and every female \r\n    student is waiting for the time when it will get her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are many cases of students killing one another, or \r\n    students killing their teachers, all due to competition in winning the love \r\n    of a female student.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no longer any shyness or modesty among male and \r\n    female students. You can see this in the way they are after these lessons, \r\n    and in their conversations with their families, and in their public \r\n    gatherings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They hasten to put into practice the theories they learned in \r\n    those lessons, because it is well known that teaching these lessons is \r\n    something that provokes desire &ndash; as mentioned in the question &ndash; especially \r\n    if the teaching is accompanied by pictures or films. This is what makes the \r\n    students eager to try it out in real life, if only to discover that which \r\n    was unknown, then it quickly turns into a frenzy, and if a person cannot \r\n    practise it with the opposite sex he will practise it with the members of \r\n    his own sex, and thus perversion spreads. This is happening a great deal in \r\n    those societies, and they now have institutions and associations that defend \r\n    them and demand more rights and privileges for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For all these reasons, we do not think that you or any Muslim \r\n    should live in those deviant societies, let alone study in their mixed \r\n    schools, or attend those provocative and evil &ldquo;sex education&rdquo; lessons.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this is the knowledge that they are teaching, what bad \r\n    knowledge it is!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Listen to the testimony of an American female doctor who \r\n    worked in an Arab country, and saw the state of her own country, and \r\n    realized what was wrong with the spread of &ldquo;sex education&rdquo; among male and \r\n    female students in schools. She says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If your women in the east do not know some of the secrets of \r\n    sex that are known by American girls, I would say &ndash; with a clear conscience \r\n    &ndash; that it is better for you to remain ignorant than to enjoy this knowledge. \r\n    We have given our girls lessons so that they will know about sex in detail, \r\n    but soon one of them will leave the lecture hall, looking for the nearest \r\n    boy, to practise with him the sexual theories carelessly, as if she is \r\n    taking part in a play or playing a game.

I did not have any conditions or specific \r\n    characteristics in the man I wanted to marry; I was prepared to accept any \r\n    righteous man. But years went by without this man coming to me.

One day \r\n    at the end of Sha&rsquo;baan, as we were preparing for the blessed month of \r\n    Ramadaan, Allaah guided me to keep a Mus-haf just for myself.

As for a person being \r\n    attracted to another member of his or her own sex, this is contrary to the \r\n    sound human nature that Allaah has instilled in people, and it does not \r\n    exist even among animals. In addition to being contrary to sound human \r\n    nature, it is at a lower level than that of animals.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam has refined this natural inclination and has set out \r\n    limits for it, namely marriage. The one who does not agree with these shar&rsquo;i \r\n    limits would choose the immoral action of zina. As for deviant relationships \r\n    in which a girl is attracted to another girl or a man to another man, this \r\n    is a perversion and a deviation from correct, sound human nature. These \r\n    sinful relationships lead to something that is even more abhorrent than \r\n    zina, namely homosexuality between males, and improper relationships between \r\n    women lead to lesbianism, which is another kind of deviance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sinful relationships between members of both sexes begin with \r\n    what is called admiration or infatuation. This is a serious disease which is \r\n    widespread in all societies as the result of a spiritual vacuum and lack of \r\n    knowledge and as the result of imitating kaafir societies which have gone \r\n    against human nature. This infatuation leads to love, in which the girl \r\n    cannot bear not to see the one whom she loves; if she is not able to do \r\n    that, then she will listen to her voice or look at a picture of her. Then \r\n    that sinful relationship leads to lesbianism, which is haraam. These deviant \r\n    women do not see in a man what they see in the woman they admire of \r\n    fulfilling desire and filling the heart with love. You can say the same \r\n    thing about sinful relationships between males. The love between them leads \r\n    to infatuation in the heart, as if there were no one else in the world but \r\n    him, and if the beloved were to ask his lover to prostrate to him, he would \r\n    do it! We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. This sinful relationship \r\n    ultimately leads to the abhorrent immoral action of homosexuality, and among \r\n    those perverts you see no attraction towards a woman, even if she were the \r\n    most beautiful of women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the ruling on lesbianism and masturbation?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Lesbianism among women is haraam, and is a major sin, because \r\n    it is an action that is contrary to the words of Allaah (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, \r\n    from illegal sexual acts)<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>6.&nbsp;Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their \r\n    right hands possess, __<\/i><!--[if supportFields]><![endif]--><i> \r\n    for then, they are free from blame;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>7.&nbsp;But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the \r\n    transgressors&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Mu&rsquo;minoon 23:5-7]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly masturbation is haraam, because of these same \r\n    verses, and because it causes a great deal of harm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq \r\n    &lsquo;Afeefi, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Qa&rsquo;ood.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> \r\n    (22\/68).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The person who realizes that there is someone close to him \r\n    who admires him or is infatuated with him should hasten to deal with the \r\n    matter wisely. Wisdom does not mean being heedless with regard to looking, \r\n    visiting and touching, because these are things that may make his sickness \r\n    worse, and make the pain worse. Rather wisdom means offering a suitable \r\n    remedy in a suitable manner, which includes the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Strengthening his faith, by encouraging him to do acts of \r\n    worship and avoid evil deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Instilling the love of Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his heart.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Teaching him the meaning of love for the sake of Allaah, the \r\n    basis of which is that the person who is loved for the sake of Allaah is \r\n    loved for his&nbsp; faith and acts of obedience, not for his appearance, image or \r\n    status. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Not giving him the opportunity to make contact repeatedly or \r\n    to visit frequently; explaining to him that if a legitimate relationship \r\n    transgresses the limits it becomes haraam and must be stopped.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When meeting, not allowing him to look continuously, embrace \r\n    or kiss.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Giving him academic or da&rsquo;wah-related tasks to do, such as \r\n    collecting evidence on a certain issue, or summarizing a book, or listening \r\n    to tapes, or doing da&rsquo;wah-related activities such as calling people to \r\n    Islam, distributing pamphlets and tapes, and other things which will fill \r\n    his time with beneficial acts of worship and permissible activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a Muslim feels that he is attracted to someone and fears \r\n    that this may be one of the tricks of the shaytaan, then he should hasten to \r\n    rid himself of it, and to treat himself, before it develops further and \r\n    becomes haraam love . If he wants to rid himself of that, he should do \r\n    several things, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should focus his heart on his Lord, for He is the Bestower \r\n    of blessings and bounty Who has granted him immense blessings, so he should \r\n    direct the love of his heart towards his Creator.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should cut off ties with everyone who he feels he is \r\n    developing an (inappropriate) attachment towards, so he should not continue \r\n    to listen to his voice or look at his image; he should try to avoid meeting \r\n    him, even if the focus of his love is a teacher, educator or relative. This \r\n    is the best remedy that he can give himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should continually read about the lives of righteous \r\n    people, scholars and mujaahideen, so that he can learn from those who \r\n    offered their time and their lives in the service of Islam and the Muslims \r\n    whilst he is preoccupied with looking at the image of his beloved or \r\n    enjoying listening to his voice, or reading his words. These are things that \r\n    are it is not befitting for a Muslim to do even once, so how about if this \r\n    is his whole life?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should also ponder the grave and serious effects of these \r\n    two destructive diseases, namely haraam infatuation and love. The harm that \r\n    they cause includes the following:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Diverting a person from his \r\n    Lord and Creator to focus on a weak creature who may harm him but cannot \r\n    benefit him<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Creating worry, anxiety, grief, \r\n    confusion and depression in this world, and torment in the Hereafter<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Imagining kinds of haraam \r\n    actions with the object of his love and infatuation, such as looking, \r\n    touching and kissing with desire. That may even lead a woman to lesbianism \r\n    and a man to homosexuality to bring these images out of the realm of \r\n    imagination and into the realm of reality.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iv)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Contamination of sound human \r\n    nature (fitnah) with a weakening of natural sexual desire, which will lead \r\n    to spoiling of a woman&rsquo;s relationship with her husband and her desire for \r\n    the haraam things that she has become used to; similar effects may also \r\n    apply to men.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Relationships between Muslims should be based on sharee&rsquo;ah \r\n    and taqwa (piety). The one who comes together with another person on the \r\n    basis of sin in this world will find their relationship turned into one of \r\n    enmity on the Day of Resurrection.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except \r\n    Al&#8209;Muttaqoon (the pious&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Zukhruf 43:67]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says: Those who were friends on the basis of \r\n    disobedience towards Allaah in this world will be enemies of one another, \r\n    disavowing one another, except for those who were friends on the basis of \r\n    fearing and obeying Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tafseer al-Tabari<\/i> (21\/637).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    i.e., every friendship that was not for the sake of Allaah, \r\n    on the Day of Resurrection will be turned into enmity, except that which was \r\n    for the sake of Allaah, for that will last because it is connected to the \r\n    One Who is eternal. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tafseer Ibn Katheer<\/i> (7\/237).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If friendship and love are based on something other than the \r\n    best interests of both parties, then the consequences will be enmity.

The wise man is the one who \r\n    protects his capital from loss and the loser is the one who squanders the \r\n    most precious thing that he possesses and does not appreciate its sanctity \r\n    or acknowledge its value.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Tafseer al-Raazi Mafaateeh al-Ghayb<\/i> \r\n    (22\/83):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah swears by al-&lsquo;asr &ndash; which is time &ndash; because of the \r\n    amazing things in it. In it both ease and hardship, good health and \r\n    sickness, wealth and poverty occur, and the value of time cannot be compared \r\n    to even the most precious and valuable of things. If you wasted one thousand \r\n    years on something that does not matter, then you made the most of the last \r\n    moment of your life to repent, you would abide in Paradise for eternity. \r\n    Therefore you should realize that the noblest thing in your life is the \r\n    moment you are in, and time is one of the foundations of blessings. Hence \r\n    Allaah swore by it, and He drew attention to the fact that night and day are \r\n    opportunities that man wastes, for time is nobler than place, so He swore by \r\n    it, because time is a pure blessing in which there is no defect, rather the \r\n    defective loser is man. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: Then we advise you not to go to extremes in \r\n    refraining from talking to people and friends, and to allow a certain amount \r\n    of time to sit with them and speak kindly to them, especially relatives. It \r\n    was the practice of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) to visit his companions and enjoy their company and talk with them. \r\n    What is forbidden is to go to extremes in that so that long hours pass or it \r\n    leads to neglect of other obligatory duties that are waiting to be done, \r\n    such as worship, learning, work and so on. The best of things are those that \r\n    are moderate and the one who intends to do good, Allaah will enable him to \r\n    do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When speaking to your friends and relatives, you should try \r\n    to discuss serious topics with them, and things that will benefit both your \r\n    religious and worldly interests, so that you will be rewarded for teaching \r\n    them and your sitting with them will count in your favour on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection, and not count against you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;No people sit in a gathering in which they do not remember \r\n    Allaah or send blessings upon the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him), but it will be a source of regret for them on the Day \r\n    of Resurrection, even if they enter Paradise as a reward.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (2\/463) and classed as saheeh by the \r\n    commentators according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and \r\n    Muslim), and by Shaykh al-Albaani in <i>al-Silsilah al-Saheehah<\/i> (no. \r\n    76).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: Make proper excuses to those who steal your time, \r\n    and think of means of achieving that. You know your situation. For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You could apologize by saying that you are busy preparing for \r\n    a university or school exam, or a course of study, if you have anything to \r\n    do with these things, or say that you are busy preparing a certain project \r\n    for some organization. People usually accept these things, and they will \r\n    encourage you to make the most of your time for those purposes. If you \r\n    really do have to make some commitment to an academic body in order to \r\n    convince people, if you do not actually have any exam to prepare for or work \r\n    to do, then make that your intention when you speak of it, because \r\n    preparation&nbsp; always takes precedence, thus you will be telling the truth and \r\n    finding an excuse to give to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You could use this excuse with the guests who are present, \r\n    and you can also use this excuse with friends who call you up, but getting \r\n    rid of people on the phone is easier, because the one who is calling you \r\n    cannot see what you are really doing at home. So you can apologize by saying \r\n    that you want to go and pray before the time for prayer ends, and your \r\n    intention may be to offer a naafil prayer if you have already offered the \r\n    obligatory prayer; or you could ask your mother to call you whilst you are \r\n    speaking on the phone and ask you to help her with something. If your friend \r\n    hears your mother calling, she will end her call. In these ways you can find \r\n    ways to rid yourself of the time-wasters whom many people have to deal \r\n    with.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We will quote here the complaint of one of the scholars about \r\n    those who waste one&rsquo;s time, and how he dealt with this problem, and some \r\n    beautiful words about the importance of time, and the necessity of making \r\n    good use of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Jawzi said in <i>Sayd al-Khaatir<\/i> (p. 240-241):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I seek refuge with Allaah from the company of idle folk! I \r\n    have seen many people who tried with me what is customary among many people \r\n    of visiting a great deal and they call these frequent visits a kind of \r\n    service; they want to sit with me and chat as people chat about what people \r\n    are talking about, and what does not concern anyone, and what may be gheebah \r\n    (backbiting).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what many people do nowadays, and the one who is \r\n    visited may ask for that, or long for it, and feel lonely when no one visits \r\n    him, especially when there is a celebration or on Eid. So you see them going \r\n    to visit one another, and they don&rsquo;t limit it to offering greetings and \r\n    saying salaam, rather they add to that a great deal of what I call wasting \r\n    time. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When I realized that time is the noblest thing, and that it \r\n    should be spent in doing good, I hated that, and I had two choices with \r\n    regard to them: if I tell them off, it will cause problems, and if I accept \r\n    it from them I will be wasting time! So I began to avoid meeting people as \r\n    much as I could, then if I did meet them I would try to keep the \r\n    conversation brief so that I could leave quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then I prepared things that I could do to prevent talking to \r\n    them when they met me, lest time be wasted. Some of the preparations that I \r\n    made for meeting them were cutting paper for writing, sharpening pens and \r\n    putting papers together to make notebooks, because these things are \r\n    essential, but they do not need any thought or focus. So I kept them for the \r\n    times of their visits so that none of my time would be wasted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to make us realize the preciousness of time and \r\n    help us to make the most of it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I have met many people who do not know the meaning of life. \r\n    Allaah has made some of them independent of means because they have a great \r\n    deal of wealth, so they sit in the marketplace for most of the day, watching \r\n    people, and they may see a great deal of evil deeds and objectionable \r\n    things. Some of them focus on playing chess and some waste their time in \r\n    talking about the rulers, or how expensive or cheap things are, and so on. I \r\n    realized that Allaah does not guide anyone to understanding the preciousness \r\n    of life and the value of time and health, except the one whom He inspires to \r\n    make the most of it. <i>&ldquo;and none is granted it except the owner of the \r\n    great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high \r\n    moral character)&rdquo; [Fussilat 41:35]<\/i>.

There has come to you a good advice from your \r\n    Lord (i.e. the Qur&rsquo;aan, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that \r\n    is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, &mdash; a guidance and \r\n    a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers&rdquo; [Yoonus \r\n    10:57]<\/i>.

Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):<i> &ldquo;Those who \r\n    believed (in the Oneness of Allaah &mdash; Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts \r\n    find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, in the remembrance of Allaah \r\n    do hearts find rest&rdquo; [al-Ra &lsquo;d 13:28].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, all of that must be accompanied with humility in \r\n    the heart towards Allah and feeling a sense of His love and closeness, along \r\n    with sincerity towards Him in public and in private, hoping to attain the \r\n    state of true servitude towards Him (&lsquo;uboodiyyah) which is the basis of \r\n    success on the Day of Resurrection.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On our website you will find a number of answers which will \r\n    help you &ndash; in sha Allah &ndash; to implement the shar&lsquo;i remedy.

The remedy for that \r\n    is for the person to allow himself to rest and recuperate; to remember Allah \r\n    a great deal and read Qur'aan; to always seek refuge with Allah from the \r\n    accursed Shaytaan; to always ask for forgiveness because seeking forgiveness \r\n    is one of the means of attaining good and warding off evil; to strive to \r\n    keep company with good people like him, because a good companion is like the \r\n    carrier of musk - he will either give you some or sell you some or you will \r\n    find a good smell from him. He should try to keep away from that which he \r\n    should not think about, because thinking of something may make a person move \r\n    from imagining it to actually doing it, but if he tries to ignore it and \r\n    forget it, then by Allah&rsquo;s leave it will cease to trouble him.

This -- unfortunately -- \r\n    happens a lot with the wives of fathers, and many, both male and female, \r\n    suffer from this.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What we advise you to do \r\n    is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You must deal with the \r\n    matter seriously and quickly, try to instil a sense of love, mercy and \r\n    compassion in her heart, in the hope that she will stop what she is doing. \r\n    If you succeed in doing that, then you will have achieved what you want and \r\n    she will still be your wife.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you do not succeed, then \r\n    you have no choice but divorce. We do not advise you to be hardhearted and \r\n    harsh, because that will only make her more cruel towards your daughter, and \r\n    she will find more ways to harm her, whilst concealing the evidence of her \r\n    misdeeds. Hence if she does not respond to you and change her behaviour, and \r\n    mend her ways in response to kindness and persuasion, there is no solution \r\n    that will put an end to your suffering except divorce, sooner rather than \r\n    later. You are aware of your daughter&rsquo;s suffering, and you hear her cries, \r\n    and you see the injury to her face and the burns on her leg and stomach, yet \r\n    despite that you're still confused because you have a son from her. So how \r\n    would it be if there were more children then?! But we will not hide anything \r\n    from you, and we will tell you frankly that with a woman such as this, whom \r\n    you have divorced twice yet it has not stopped her wrongdoing and \r\n    aggression, there is no hope for much good in her, and it cannot be expected \r\n    that she will be kind to your daughter, because mercy cannot be instilled by \r\n    means of threats or warnings in the heart of one whom Allaah has deprived of \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you think of divorcing \r\n    her for a third time, or she sees signs of that in you, do not leave your \r\n    daughter with her, rather leave her with one of your relatives or with \r\n    trustworthy women among your neighbours or friends, because she might try to \r\n    take revenge on her because of your divorcing her.

An individual may be enjoined to mix with others \r\n    sometimes and to remain alone sometimes. That depends on the purpose. If \r\n    mixing with others is for the purpose of cooperating in righteousness and \r\n    piety, then it is enjoined; but if it is for the purpose of cooperating in \r\n    sin and transgression, then it is forbidden. Mixing with Muslims is a kind \r\n    of worship, as in the case of the five daily prayers, Jumu&rsquo;ah, Eid, eclipse \r\n    prayers, prayers for rain and so on. This is something that Allah and His \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have enjoined. The same \r\n    applies to mixing with them on Hajj and when fighting the kuffaar and \r\n    rebels, even if the leaders of that are evildoers and even if there are some \r\n    evildoers among the people involved.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to being involved in gatherings that \r\n    increase a person's faith, either because he benefits from these gatherings \r\n    or he can benefit others, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 10\/425&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus you can see that the way you are is something that is \r\n    not pleasing to the Lord of the Worlds, and you have to look again at the \r\n    situation and realise that what you are doing is a trick from the shaytaan \r\n    who is making your situation and your bad deed look good to you. Beware of \r\n    him and his tricks, and get ready to fight him, and trust that your Lord \r\n    will help you by granting victory against him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you feel distress when mixing with people, then we can be \r\n    certain that you will never be better off on your own or in isolation. \r\n    Rather the wolf eats the sheep that wanders off from the flock and the \r\n    shaytaan overpowers those who are solitary and do not have helpers to help \r\n    them obey their Lord or supporters who will support them against the \r\n    shaytaan and his troops. Even if you find some annoyance in mixing with \r\n    people, that mixing, if you bear it with patience, is still better than not \r\n    mixing. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) praised the \r\n    one who mixes with people and bears their annoyance with patience.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The believer who mixes \r\n    with people and bears their annoyance with patience will have a greater \r\n    reward than the one who does not mix with people and does not put up with \r\n    their annoyance.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (5207) and Ibn Maajah (4032).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, there is no reason for your isolation and you do \r\n    not have -- as far as we can see -- any justification for which we would \r\n    encourage you to remain like that. We feel that any isolation which results \r\n    in you not praying jumu&rsquo;ah for prayers in congregation is not acceptable and \r\n    we do not encourage it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the reasons for isolation include total corruption of \r\n    people, lack of people to support you in adhering to the truth, each person \r\n    admiring his own opinion, and lack of benefit in sincerely advising people. \r\n    By Allah's grace, none of these are applicable in Muslim societies or even \r\n    in kaafir societies. We have heard of thousands of kuffaar who are entering \r\n    the religion of Allah all the time, and we hear of others like them, sinners \r\n    who have begun to follow the path of guidance. Indeed we find that people \r\n    are thirsting for those who will quench their thirst and they are hungry for \r\n    those who will feed them, in spiritual terms of goodness and guidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for your justification for isolation, namely shar&rsquo;i \r\n    knowledge, we do not think this is the case. You are preferring isolation to \r\n    the kind of mixing that is obligatory, so if you are neglecting Islamic \r\n    duties because of this isolation of yours, what kind of sha&rsquo;i knowledge do \r\n    you have so that we could tell you to keep away from people and focus on \r\n    obeying your Lord and preserving your religious commitment? Hence Abu \r\n    Sulaymaan al-Khattaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Isolation only \r\n    benefits scholars and wise men, but it is the most harmful of things for the \r\n    ignorant. And he narrated from Ibraaheem that he said to Mugheerah: Acquire \r\n    deep understanding of Islam, then you can isolate yourself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>al-&lsquo;Azlah<\/i> by al-Khattaabi, p. 225&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As you have written to us -- and we appreciate that -- this \r\n    means that you are still holding on to a thread and the beginning of the \r\n    right way to bring you out of this fatal loneliness. You have entered the \r\n    world of the Internet, which is millions of times greater than your small \r\n    world that you have forsaken. In this vast world there is far more evil than \r\n    in your forsaken world. So beware of that, for how much temptation it has \r\n    caused to righteous people and how much evil it has caused to righteous and \r\n    chaste women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Strive to do the acts of worship which Allah has enjoined on \r\n    you, first and foremost among which is praying in congregation in the \r\n    mosque. In the answer to question number\r\n    [fatin]120[\\fatin] you will find the evidence \r\n    for this duty. You also have to earn permissible income so as to protect \r\n    your dignity and spare you from having to ask of people, and so that you can \r\n    honour your parents and take care of them and help them to buy what they \r\n    need or help them to get to the places they want to go, and uphold ties of \r\n    kinship with your family and relatives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should remember that this world will never be free of \r\n    hardships, worries and distress. If you want a place where there is none of \r\n    these things, with complete happiness and ease, a good life and the pleasure \r\n    of Allah, then you will find that in the Paradise of Allah in the Hereafter. \r\n    So strive for that Day and rid yourself of that which may cause you distress \r\n    in this world by reducing your involvement in it; ask Allah to help you to \r\n    attain that, and remember that isolating oneself is nothing more than being \r\n    alone with the Shaytaan, and it will only bring you more worries and \r\n    distress. Do you not see that the punishment of imprisonment is painful for \r\n    the free man, and the worst form of it is solitary confinement? So how can \r\n    you prefer for yourself that which prisoners would sacrifice that which is \r\n    most dear to them in order to escape? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allah to guide you to the truth and to help you to follow the path of the righteous among His slaves; were it not for the fact that Allah decreed that they should mix with people and establish acts of worship, we and you would not have known Islam or had the honour of belonging to it.

Allah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;then if you ascertain that they \r\n    [Muslim women] are true believers send them not back to the disbelievers&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy upon him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This verse is the one that made it haraam for Muslim women to \r\n    marry mushrik men. It was permissible at the beginning of Islam for a \r\n    mushrik to marry a believing woman. Hence Abu&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Aas ibn al-Rabee&lsquo; married \r\n    the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), when she was a Muslim and he was a \r\n    follower of his people&rsquo;s religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Tafseer Ibn Katheer<\/i>, 8\/93&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (7\/133) it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a \r\n    non-Muslim man, even if he is a dhimmi or a kitaabi (one of the people of \r\n    the Book, i.e. a Jew or a Christian). This is according to the consensus of \r\n    the fuqaha&rsquo;, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And \r\n    give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al&#8209;Mushrikoon till they believe (in \r\n    Allaah Alone)&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:221]<\/i> and <i>&ldquo;send them not back to the \r\n    disbelievers.

The timing of showing her Islam openly and leaving her family, \r\n    whichever comes first, depends on her evaluation of her own circumstances. \r\n    If she is afraid that if her family find out about her being Muslim they \r\n    will detain her or prevent her from running away for the sake of her \r\n    religion, or they will force her to go back to kufr or to marry a kaafir, \r\n    then in this case we advise her to leave them first and go to another place \r\n    where she will be safe, either under the protection of the government in her \r\n    country if they offer protection in such cases, or under the care of one of \r\n    the Islamic centres in her country.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Muslims are excused for staying among the kuffaar and not \r\n    practising their religion openly if they are weak and oppressed among them \r\n    and cannot leave and flee from them. But the one who finds a way out no \r\n    longer has this excuse, so it is not permissible for him to stay among the \r\n    kuffaar, not in their house or in their country. If he can find a safe \r\n    refuge in the same country, he should move there from his house, but if the \r\n    country itself is not safe, he should move from his house to another country \r\n    where his life will be safe and he will be able to practice his religion \r\n    openly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to mere fear about the family's reputation, this \r\n    is not a valid excuse unless her religious commitment and her life are in \r\n    danger because of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Who knows? Perhaps showing her religion openly will bring a \r\n    great deal of good to her and her family, and some of her family members may \r\n    become Muslim. This is what has happened with other sisters who showed their \r\n    Islam openly.

So it is not permissible to say that an act of worship is \r\n    prescribed &ndash; with regard to its principle, number, form or place except with \r\n    proper shar&rsquo;i evidence. We do not know of any Sunnah concerning that which \r\n    was narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him), whether in word or deed, or his approval, which would point to the \r\n    claim made by the second group. All goodness is in following the guidance of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his \r\n    guidance with regard to this matter is proven with evidence of what he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do after prayer, and \r\n    what his successors (the caliphs) and companions and the Taabi&rsquo;een and those \r\n    who followed them in goodness also used to do. Whoever introduces anything \r\n    that goes against the guidance of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) will have it rejected. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does any deed that is not in \r\n    accordance with this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo; The imam who \r\n    says du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; after the prayer and the congregation says ameen to his du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, \r\n    all of them raising their hands, should be asked for evidence to support his \r\n    action, otherwise it is to be rejected, The same applies to one who does \r\n    that after naafil prayers; he should be asked for evidence as Allaah says \r\n    concerning such things (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Say (O Muhammad), Produce your proof if you are truthful&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:111]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not know of any evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah \r\n    which suggests that what the second group claims is prescribed in Islam, \r\n    namely reciting du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; together and reciting dhikr in the manner mentioned \r\n    in the question.

Hence some of \r\n    the scholars stated that this prayer is not allowed, as we shall see below. \r\n    The same applies to their saying &ldquo;the number of the names of Allaah&rdquo;, \r\n    because the names of Allaah are not limited to a specific number, as the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I ask You by \r\n    every name by which You have called Yourself or You have taught to anyone of \r\n    Your creation or You have revealed in Your Book or You have kept secret in \r\n    the knowledge of the Unseen which is with You.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad (3704).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Aabideen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his <i>\r\n    Haashiyah<\/i> (6\/396): You should avoid using such phrases as &ldquo;O Allaah, \r\n    send blessings upon Muhammad as much as Your knowledge and forbearance, to \r\n    the extent of Your mercy, as many as Your Words, and much as the perfection \r\n    of Allaah,&rdquo; and so on, because this may suggest than a divine attribute has \r\n    many forms or that there is a limit to His knowledge, especially phrases \r\n    such as &ldquo;as much as Your knowledge,&nbsp; as much as You can hear,as much as Your \r\n    words&rdquo;, because there is no limit to His knowledge or mercy, or to His \r\n    words.

Then he moved on and we moved on with him until \r\n    he came to one of those circles, and he stood over them and said: What is \r\n    this that I see you doing?

Everything that has been narrated concerning a \r\n    specific date for these events cannot be proven to have come from the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) according to the \r\n    scholars of hadeeth. Allaah has wise reasons for causing the people to \r\n    forget it. Even if the date were proven, it would not be permissible for the \r\n    Muslims to single it out for particular acts of worship, and it is not \r\n    permissible for them to celebrate it, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with them) did not celebrate it and they did not single it out in any way. \r\n    If celebrating it was something that is prescribed in Islam, the Messenger \r\n    would have told his ummah about that, either in word or in deed. If any such \r\n    thing had happened, it would have been well known, and his companions would \r\n    have transmitted the information to us. They narrated from their Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) everything that his ummah \r\n    needs to know, and they did not neglect any aspect of the religion, rather \r\n    they were the first ones to do anything good. If celebrating this night had \r\n    been prescribed in Islam, they would have been the first people to do so. \r\n    The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the most \r\n    sincere of people, and he conveyed the message to the people in full, and he \r\n    fulfilled the trust. If venerating and celebrating this night were part of \r\n    the religion of Allaah, then the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) would have done that and would not have concealed it. Since no \r\n    such thing happened, it is known that celebrating it and venerating it is \r\n    not part of Islam at all. Allaah has perfected this ummah&rsquo;s religion for it \r\n    and has completed His favour upon them, and He condemns those who introduce \r\n    things into the religion which Allaah has not ordained.

It also implies \r\n    that there is something lacking in Islam, and that it is not complete, and \r\n    it is well known that this leads to great mischief and evil, and goes \r\n    against the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, \r\n    completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your \r\n    religion&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:3]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It also goes against the \r\n    ahaadeeth of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    which warn against innovation (bid&rsquo;ah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I hope that the evidence we have quoted will be sufficient to \r\n    convince the seeker of truth that this bid&rsquo;ah is wrong, i.e., the innovation \r\n    of celebrating the night of the Isra&rsquo; and Mi&rsquo;raaj, and that it is not part \r\n    of the religion of Islam at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because Allaah has enjoined being sincere towards the Muslims and explaining what Allaah has prescribed for them in their religion, and because it is haraam to conceal knowledge, I thought that I should point out this innovation, which is so widespread in many regions that people think it is part of the religion, to my Muslim brothers. Allaah is the One Whom we ask to set the affairs of all the Muslims straight, and to bless them with knowledge of Islam, and to help us and them to adhere steadfastly to the truth, and to forsake everything that goes against it, for He is able to do that.

For example, if the deceased \r\n    was an evildoer, the speaker may say, &ldquo;Look at this man, yesterday he used \r\n    to play, yesterday he used to mock, yesterday he used to do such and such, \r\n    but now he is in his grave and being brought to account.&rdquo; Or he may say \r\n    concerning a businessman: &ldquo;Look at So and so, yesterday he was enjoying \r\n    palaces and cars and servants and so on, and now he is in his grave.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We think that there should not be a preacher delivering a \r\n    khutbah at the graveside, because this is not Sunnah. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not stand after burying the \r\n    deceased, or when waiting to bury the deceased, and address the people, and \r\n    we have not heard of anyone doing this among those who came before us, who \r\n    were closer to the Sunnah than us. Neither have we heard of this from the \r\n    khulafa&rsquo; who came before them. The people at the time of Abu Bakr, &lsquo;Umar, \r\n    &lsquo;Uthmaan and &lsquo;Ali did not do this, as far as we know, and the best of \r\n    guidance is the guidance of those who came before, if it is in accordance \r\n    with the truth. With regard to the exhortation that is like regular talk in \r\n    a gathering, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Sunan<\/i> that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) went out to Baqee&rsquo; al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Madeenah) where some \r\n    people were burying one of their number who had died. The deceased had not \r\n    yet been placed in the lahd (niche in the side of the grave) and they were \r\n    still digging his grave. He sat down and his companions sat around him, and \r\n    he started telling them about what happens to a person when he is dying and \r\n    after he has been buried. He spoke to them in a quiet manner, not in the \r\n    manner of a khutbah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also narrated in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> and \r\n    elsewhere that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;There is no one among you for whom his place in Paradise or in Hell \r\n    has not been decreed.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not rely \r\n    on that?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;No; strive hard, for each person will be enabled to do \r\n    that for which he was created.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that the kind of exhortation where a man stands \r\n    and delivers a speech at the burial or afterwards is not Sunnah and is not \r\n    appropriate for the reasons I have mentioned. As for exhortation that does \r\n    not take the form of a khutbah or speech, such as when a man sits and his \r\n    companions sit with him, and he says a few words appropriate to the \r\n    occasion, this is good and is following the example of the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him)<br \/><br \/>Source: Liqaa&rsquo;aat al-Baab il-Maftooh by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, 2\/55-56."},{"id":"10410","question_id":"10410","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    This report that you are asking about is nothing new, but it \r\n    has become more widely disseminated nowadays because of the ease and speed \r\n    of communication via e-mail, combined with the ignorance of many who love \r\n    their religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There may be some variation in the details of these stories, \r\n    but they are all based on the same idea and all have the same bad effect on \r\n    people&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    warned against them.

For if there \r\n    is One Who is described in such terms, none should be worshipped except Him \r\n    alone and none should be described as being one and unique except Him; may \r\n    He be glorified above those that they associate with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So whoever affirms this Tawheed in the true sense must \r\n    inevitably also affirm the Oneness of Allaah&rsquo;s Divinity (Tawheed \r\n    al-Uloohiyyah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah means devoting all acts of worship, \r\n    both inward and outward, in word and deed, to Allaah Alone, and not \r\n    worshipping anything or anyone other than Allaah, no matter who he is. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Isra&rsquo; 17:23]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:36]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may be described as devoting all one&rsquo;s actions to Allaah \r\n    alone. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is called Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah because it is based on <i>\r\n    ta&rsquo;alluh lillaah<\/i> which is worship and devotion of Allaah accompanied by \r\n    love and veneration.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also called <i>Tawheed al-&lsquo;Ibaadah<\/i> (oneness of \r\n    worship) because it means that a person worships Allaah by doing that which \r\n    He has commanded and avoiding that which He has forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is also called <i>Tawheed al-Talab wa&rsquo;l-Qasd wa&rsquo;l-Iraadah<\/i> \r\n    (Oneness of goal, purpose and will) because it means that a person does not \r\n    seek anything except the Face of Allaah, so he worships Him sincerely.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>\r\n    This is the kind of Tawheed concerning which people went \r\n    astray, which is why the Prophets were sent and the Books were revealed. \r\n    This is the purpose for which the universe was created and laws were \r\n    prescribed. Concerning this disputes arose between the Prophets and their \r\n    peoples, so the stubborn were doomed and the believers were saved.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p><span>\r\n    Whoever goes astray with regard to this Tawheed, such as \r\n    devoting some of his worship to someone other than Allaah, has gone beyond \r\n    the pale of Islam and drifted away from true belief. May Allaah protect us \r\n    from that.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to <i>Tawheed al-Asma&rsquo; wa&rsquo;l-Sifaat<\/i> (Oneness \r\n    of the Divine Names and Attributes), this means affirming the names and \r\n    attributes of Allaah and believing that there is none like unto Allaah in \r\n    His names and attributes. This Tawheed is based on two principles:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Affirmation: i.e., affirming that which Allaah has \r\n    affirmed for Himself in His Book or that His Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) has affirmed of His beautiful names and \r\n    sublime attributes in a manner that suits the Majesty and Greatness of \r\n    Allaah, without distorting them, twisting their meanings, denying their \r\n    reality or discussing how they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Denial: i.e., denying that Allaah has any faults and \r\n    denying any shortcomings that He has denied Himself. The evidence for that \r\n    is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;There is nothing like Him, and He is the All&#8209;Hearer, the \r\n    All&#8209;Seer&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Shoora 42:11]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>\r\n    So He has denied that He bears any resemblance to His \r\n    creation, and affirmed that He has attributes of perfection in a manner that \r\n    befits Him, may He be glorified.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Hujjah fi Bayaan al-Mahajjah<\/i>, 1\/305; <i>\r\n    Lawaami&rsquo; al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah<\/i>, 1\/57.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10412","question_id":"10412","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is no dispute among the scholars that it is makrooh to bury the deceased in a coffin if \r\n    there is no need for that.

By the One in Whose hand is my soul, either you are following a way that is more guided than the way of Muhammad \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or you are starting a way that is the way of misguidance.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>They said, &ldquo;By Allaah, O Abu &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan, \r\n    we did not intend anything but good.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He said, &ldquo;How many of those who intend good \r\n    never attain it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Not everyone who seeks or intends good \r\n    attains it and is guided to it. Not every act of worship is accepted, unless it is in accordance with the Sunnah of Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This denunciation by Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah \r\n    be pleased with him) puts an end to the argument presented by innovators, because they always say, &ldquo;What reason can there be not to recite dhikr, \r\n    prayers and Qur&rsquo;aan? We only intend good and to draw closer to Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It should be said to them: Worship must be \r\n    something that is prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah in essence and in its form and the manner in which it is done. If a specific number is prescribed in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah then no one has the right to go beyond that, and if no number or way is specified then no one has the right to invent a limit for it, \r\n    because that implies that one is assuming the role of a lawgiver. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is further supported by the report \r\n    narrated from Sa&rsquo;eed ibn al-Musayyib (may Allaah have mercy on him). He saw a man praying more than two rak&rsquo;ahs after dawn had come (i.e., Fajr), \r\n    and he told him not to do that. The man said, &ldquo;O Abu Muhammad, will Allaah punish me for praying?!&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>He said, &ldquo;No, but He will punish you for \r\n    going against the Sunnah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Look at the understanding of this great \r\n    Taabi&rsquo;i, may Allaah have mercy on him. That is because the regular Sunnah is to pray only two rak&rsquo;ahs after the dawn has come, not more than that, \r\n    then to pray the obligatory prayer of Fajr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A similar report was narrated from Imam \r\n    Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him).

But it is not permissible \r\n    to call any of the issues of religion insignificant. There is the fear that the person who says such a thing by way of belittling or mocking may \r\n    be apostatizing from his religion thereby, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;If you ask them (about this), they declare: &lsquo;We were only talking idly and joking.&rsquo; Say: &lsquo;Was \r\n    it at Allaah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you \r\n    had believed&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Tawbah 9:65-66]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Messenger peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) is the one who enjoined letting the beard grow and trimming the moustache; it is essential to obey him and to heed his \r\n    commands and prohibitions in all matters.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm narrated that there was \r\n    scholarly consensus that letting the beard grow and trimming the moustache is something obligatory, and undoubtedly happiness, salvation, pride, \r\n    honour and good consequences lie in obeying Allaah and His Messenger, and doom, loss and bad consequences lie in disobeying Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger. Similarly, wearing one&rsquo;s clothes above the ankles is obligatory because of the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him): &ldquo;Whatever part of the lower garment hangs below the ankles is in the Fire.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhari in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>). And he \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There are three to whom Allaah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection, nor even look at \r\n    them or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment: the one who lets his lower garment hang below his ankles; the one who reminds others of \r\n    things he has given to them; and the one who sells his product by means of false oaths.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>). And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah will not look at the one who lets his garment drag out of pride.&rdquo; (Agree upon).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So the Muslim man must fear Allaah by \r\n    shortening his garment above the ankles, whether it is a galabiyah, an izaar (lower garment, waist-wrapper), pants or abayah (cloak), and not \r\n    letting it come down below his ankles. It is better if it comes to mid-calf length. If the isbaal (letting the garment hang below the ankles) is \r\n    done because of pride or arrogance, the sin is more serious;&nbsp; if it is because of carelessness and not because of pride, it is still an evil \r\n    action and the one who does it is a sinner according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, but his sin is less serious than the sin of \r\n    one who does it out of pride. Undoubtedly isbaal is a means that leads to arrogance even if the one who does claims that he is not doing it out of \r\n    pride, because the warning in the ahaadeeth is general, so it is not permissible to take this matter lightly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the story of al-Siddeeq (Abu \r\n    Bakr), when he said to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;My izaar (lower garment) slips down unless I pay attention \r\n    to it&rdquo;, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, &ldquo;You are not one of those who do it out of arrogance,&rdquo; this \r\n    applies to those whose case is like that of Abu Bakr with regard to their garment slipping down by mistake, not because of arrogance, but they \r\n    still try not to let that happen. As for those who let their garment drag deliberately, this warning applies to them but not to people like Abu \r\n    Bakr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As well as the warning mentioned above, \r\n    isbaal (letting the garment hang below the ankle) is also a kind of extravagance and exposes the garment to dirt and impurities, and it is an \r\n    imitation of women.

For example, there are adhkaar (dhikr) which \r\n    are prescribed following the prescribed prayers, which are well known, and \r\n    no Muslim disagrees with this. But if a group of people comes along and says \r\n    that so long as dhikr is prescribed following the prayer then we will \r\n    remember Allaah together and recite dhikr in unison, this is bid&rsquo;ah. We say \r\n    to them, either you think that this way of reciting dhikr is better than the \r\n    way of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and \r\n    therefore that you are following a way that is more guided and better than \r\n    his <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &ndash; which no Muslim would \r\n    say who testifies that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah &ndash; or this is \r\n    wrong and is an innovation, so they should give it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence it is clear that regarding this matter as bid&rsquo;ah does \r\n    not mean at all that reciting al-Faatihah is wrong, rather what is wrong is \r\n    reciting it in the manner mentioned in the question. We do not love the \r\n    Sahaabah any more than those who came after them (the Taabi&rsquo;een), and the \r\n    Sahaabah were the people who had the greatest love for Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it is not \r\n    narrated that they did that for their Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) when he died. All goodness is to be found in following \r\n    them and their way, and all evil is to be found in going against them and \r\n    shunning their way. Moreover, the fact that these people single out &lsquo;Ali and \r\n    do this on the occasion of his death implies that they are exaggerating \r\n    about him.

It has not been proven from the words \r\n          or deeds or approval of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he recited du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in \r\n          unison with others following the prayers, or after reading Qur&rsquo;aan, \r\n          or following each lesson, whether that took the form of the imaam reciting \r\n          du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and the congregation saying Ameen to his du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, or whether they \r\n          all recited du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; together in unison. That was not known at the time \r\n          of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs or any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah \r\n          be pleased with them). Whoever adheres to the practice of reciting du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n          in unison following the prayers or after reading Qur&rsquo;aan or after every \r\n          lesson has innovated something and introduced into the religion something \r\n          which is not a part of it. It was narrated that the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever innovates \r\n          something in this matter of ours (i.e. Islam) that is not part of it \r\n          will have it rejected.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Whoever does something that is \r\n          not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>If it \r\n          were prescribed to adhere to a certain way of doing it, the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his successors (khulafa&rsquo;) \r\n          after him would have adhered to that. We have stated above that no such \r\n          thing was proven from him or from his companions (may Allaah be pleased \r\n          with them). All goodness is to be found in following the guidance of \r\n          the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the guidance of the \r\n          Rightly-Guided Khulafa&rsquo; (may Allaah be pleased with them); all evil \r\n          is to be found in going against their guidance and following the innovated \r\n          matters against which the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us by saying, &ldquo;Beware \r\n          of newly-innovated matters, for every innovation is misguidance.&rdquo; May \r\n          Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and \r\n          grant them peace.&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFataawa Islamiyyah, 4\/178\r\n<\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10435","question_id":"10435","answers":"<p>&nbsp;<big><span>Praise \r\n          be to Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah \r\n          have mercy on him) was asked this question, and he replied as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Setting aside a regular day for giving lectures or holding \r\n          a study circle is not a reprehensible bid&rsquo;ah.

Undoubtedly this \r\n          undermines Tawheed, because Tawheed means worship and seeking help. \r\n          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>&ldquo;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for \r\n          help (for each and everything).&rdquo;[al-Faatihah 1:5]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          and:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>&ldquo;So worship Him (O Muhammad) and put your trust in \r\n          Him&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>[Hood 11:123]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Hence &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) used \r\n          to say that the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her in Shawwaal \r\n          and consummated the marriage with her in Shawwaal and she was the dearest \r\n          and most beloved of his wives to him. The Arabs used to regard this \r\n          month as inauspicious and they used to say that if a person got married \r\n          in Shawwaal, the marriage would not succeed, but this is not true.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          In the case of one who believes in evil omens, one of \r\n          two things must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Either he will give up, respond to the &ldquo;bad omen&rdquo;, and \r\n          not take action, which is the worst kind of superstition and pessimism, \r\n          or he will go ahead, but he will be anxious and worried, fearing that \r\n          he will be affected by this bad omen. This is less serious, but both \r\n          detract from Tawheed and adversely affect people. (See <i>al-Qawl al-Mufeed<\/i> \r\n          by Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, part 2, p. 77-78)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          In practical terms, we see that the saheeh Sunnah of \r\n          the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prove that this myth is \r\n          false, for the best of mankind, Muhammad \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), got married to the most \r\n          beloved of people to him, namely &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n          her), and his marriage to her took place between the two Eids, and she \r\n          was one of the happiest of people with him. Indeed, she herself refuted \r\n          this jaahili claim by saying, &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me in Shawwaal and \r\n          he consummated the marriage with me in Shawwaal, and which of the wives \r\n          of the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was dearer to him than me?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &lsquo;Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah used to like marriages \r\n          to be consummated in Shawwaal. (Narrated by Muslim, 1423)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Al-Nawawi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          This shows that it is mustahabb to arrange marriages, get married and \r\n          consummate marriages in Shawwaal. Our companions stated that it is mustahabb, \r\n          and they quoted this hadeeth as evidence. By saying this, &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah \r\n          intended to refute the practice and belief of the jaahiliyyah. What \r\n          some of the common people believe nowadays, that it is disliked to arrange \r\n          marriages, get married and consummate marriages in Shawwaal, is false \r\n          and has no basis. This is one of the leftovers of the jaahiliyyah. They \r\n          used to regard that as inauspicious because of the fact that the name \r\n          Shawwaal carries connotations of lifting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i>, 9\/209&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allaah be \r\n          pleased with her) regarded it as mustahabb for a woman to be married \r\n          or the marriage to be consummated&nbsp; with her in Shawwaal. She said, \r\n          &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only married me in Shawwaal, \r\n          and which of his wives was more beloved to him than me?&rdquo; even though \r\n          the people regarded marriage in Shawwaal as inauspicious This is something \r\n          which the believers who truly put their trust in Allaah and whose hearts \r\n          truly find contentment with their Lord should resolve to do, those who \r\n          know that what Allaah wills will happen and what He does not will will \r\n          not happen, and that nothing will befall them except that which Allaah \r\n          has decreed, and that no calamity will befall them except that which \r\n          was already written in the Book before they were created, who know that \r\n          they will inevitably come to that which has been decreed for them, which \r\n          must inevitably happen to them. If they are superstitious, this will \r\n          not ward off the decree from them, rather their superstition will be \r\n          one of the main reasons why what they fear of the Divine will and decree \r\n          will come to them.

But some \r\n          of them try to follow proper etiquette, so they start the Mawlid with \r\n          the recitation of Qur&rsquo;aan. So they look for the one who can recite in \r\n          the most melodious fashion and provoke enjoyment, and he reads ten aayahs. \r\n          There are several things wrong with this: <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>(i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span>the way in which the reciter reads in this manner which is condemned \r\n          in sharee&rsquo;ah, with a quavering tone like that of a singer.

This is not what is meant by the description \r\n          which Allaah gives of the humble believers, because they love to hear \r\n          the words of the Lord, as He says in praise of them (interpretation \r\n          of the meaning): <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><i>&lsquo;And when they listen to what has \r\n          been sent down to the Messenger (Muhammad<span>), \r\n          you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they \r\n          have recognized.

Then \r\n          they start to move their heads a little, exactly like wine-drinkers, \r\n          as described above. Then when they really start to enjoy the entertainment, \r\n          they lose their shyness and dignity, exactly like the wine-drinkers, \r\n          so they get up and start to dance and shout and weep in a show of fake \r\n          humility. They move in and out and raise their arms and heads towards \r\n          the heavens as if receiving divine inspiration.

It is Sunnah to visit the \r\n          graves whether they are graves of the members of his household (Ahl \r\n          al-Bayt) or other Muslims; (it is Sunnah) to visit them, make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n          for them, pray for mercy for them and then leave. &nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>If they are the graves of kaafirs, they may be visited \r\n          for the purpose of learning a lesson and being reminded, without making \r\n          du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for them. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) visited his mother&rsquo;s grave, but \r\n          his Lord forbade him to pray for forgiveness for her.

The \r\n    number of raka&rsquo;hs during the last ten nights should be the same as the \r\n    number during the other nights.

Even \r\n    if a person is not sure, but he fasts this day for the sake of being on the \r\n    safe side, it is as if he is saying, &lsquo;If it is really the day of the \r\n    Mi&rsquo;raaj, then I will have fasted it, and if it is not, it will still be a \r\n    good action that I have done, and if I will not be rewarded for it then I \r\n    will not be punished.&rsquo; This attitude means that a person is committing \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah, and he is a sinner who deserves to be punished. But if his fast is \r\n    not because it is the day of the Mi&rsquo;raaj, but is rather because it is his \r\n    habit to fast alternate days, or to fast Mondays and Thursdays, and that \r\n    happens to coincide with the day known as the day of the Mi&rsquo;raaj, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with him fasting it with that intention, i.e., the intention \r\n    of fasting on Monday or Thursday, or a day on which he usually fasts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; What we have said about fasting on the day of the Mi&rsquo;raaj \r\n    also applies to fasting on the day of Shab-e-baraath. If any Muslim says \r\n    that fasting on the day of the Mi&rsquo;raaj or on the day of Shab-e-baraath is \r\n    not bid&rsquo;ah because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    taught us these acts of worship, so what is wrong with fasting any day apart \r\n    from the days on which it is haraam to fast? Our response to that is:<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    taught us these acts of worship, then where is the evidence (daleel) for \r\n    singling out the day of the Mi&rsquo;raaj or any other day for fasting? If there \r\n    were any evidence that it is prescribed to fast on these two days, no one \r\n    would be able to say that fasting on these days is bid&rsquo;ah. But what is \r\n    apparent is that those who say this mean that fasting is an act of worship \r\n    in general terms, so that if he fasts he has done an act of worship for \r\n    which he will be rewarded, so long as it is not on one of the days when \r\n    fasting is not allowed, such as on Eid. This would be correct if the person \r\n    who is fasting did not single out a day which he believes is a day of \r\n    virtue, such as the day of the Mi&rsquo;raaj or the day of Shab-e-baraath. What \r\n    makes this the matter of bid&rsquo;ah is the fact that one is singling out these \r\n    days. If there was any virtue in fasting these two days, the Prophet (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have fasted them, and he would \r\n    have urged us to fast them. It is known that the Companions of the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah were more keen to do good than we are; if they had known that \r\n    there was any virtue in fasting these two days, they would have fasted them. \r\n    Since we find no reports to that effect from them, we know that this is an \r\n    innovated bid&rsquo;ah, and the Prophet&nbsp; (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not a part of this matter of \r\n    ours (Islam) will have it rejected,&rdquo; i.e., it will be thrown back on the one \r\n    who does it. Fasting these two days is an action which we find no report of \r\n    the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoining, so it is \r\n    to be rejected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The &ldquo;salat tasbeeh nafil&rdquo; is to be regarded in the same \r\n    way as the matter discussed above, in the fullest sense. Acts of worship \r\n    that have no evidence (daleel) to support them are to be rejected. It has \r\n    not been proven in the Book of Allaah or in the Sunnah of His Chosen Prophet \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that there is any prayer in \r\n    which &ldquo;Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad&rdquo; is to be recited 100 times, so doing that is \r\n    an innovated bid&rsquo;ah for which the one who does it will be punished. \r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Shaykh Sa&rsquo;d al-Humayd"},{"id":"10447","question_id":"10447","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not permitted for the Muslim who believes in Allaah as his Lord,\r\n    Islam as his religion, Muhammad <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as a Prophet\r\n    and Messenger, and in the divine decree, both good and bad, to think that any being,\r\n    entity or quality can have a specific effect in bringing good or warding off harm, as\r\n    there is no evidence in sharee&#146;ah to that effect.

He\r\n    explained that all of that happens by the decree of Allaah, and that people are instructed\r\n    to avoid the causes of disaster if they are in good health.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The words &#147;no Safar&#148;, according to one of the interpretations\r\n    given by the scholars, refer to the month of Safar, which the people of the Jaahiliyyah\r\n    viewed with pessimism as being unlucky, as was reported in <i>Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i> (3914)\r\n    from Muhammad ibn Raashid from someone who heard him say: &#147;The people of the\r\n    Jaahiliyyah used to regard Safar as inauspicious, and said that it was an unlucky month.\r\n    The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) refuted that.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Imaam Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &#147;Regarding\r\n    Safar as inauspicious is a kind of superstition that is forbidden.

There is no indication in the Qur&#146;aan or Sunnah that this\r\n    number should be regarded as inauspicious in any way. The thirteenth is just an ordinary\r\n    day, like any other day, and anything that happens on such a day happens by divine decree;\r\n    Allaah decreed that it should happen on that day in that way. If a person tried to spend\r\n    his time counting the numbers of days or dates on which calamities befell the Muslim\r\n    ummah, he might find some patterns in some instances, but this has nothing to do with\r\n    &#147;bad luck&#148; because of certain numbers or dates on which those events happened.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The remedy for this kind of waswaas is for a person to strengthen his\r\n    heart, have certain faith (<i>yaqeen<\/i>) in Allaah and put his trust in Him. He should\r\n    know that no disaster happens except by the decree of Allaah, and he should beware of\r\n    getting carried away with this waswaas from the Shaytaan or these ideas that may cross his\r\n    mind. He may be punished with the very thing that he is fearing, because he is turning\r\n    away from having faith in Allaah and the belief that all good is in His hands, and that He\r\n    Alone is the one who wards off harm by His power and grace.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us the\r\n    kafaarah (expiation) to be offered by the one who indulges in any kind of superstitious\r\n    pessimism. &#145;Abd-Allaah ibn &#145;Amr reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Whoever lets tiyarah (superstition) stop him from doing\r\n    something is guilty of shirk.&#148; They said, &#147;What is the kafaarah (expiation) for\r\n    that?&#148; He said, &#147;To say: <i>Allaahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra\r\n    illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka<\/i> (O Allaah, there is no good except Your good, no\r\n    birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You).&#148; And Allaah knows best.<\/p>\r\n    <p>As this issue is widespread among people nowadays, there is no harm in\r\n    going into further detail, as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>In the Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Tiyarah and Fa&#146;l (Bad omens and good omens)<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <p>[1] Tiyarah (seeing bad omens) comes from the word tayr (birds)\r\n    [because the ancient Arabs used to see omens in the movements of birds and other creatures\r\n    &#150; Translator], and is the opposite of fa&#146;l (good omens).

The kind of tiyarah that makes a person go\r\n    ahead with his plans or stops him from going ahead is the kind of tiyarah that is\r\n    prohibited. As for the good omens (fa&#146;l) that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) liked, this is a kind of optimism that a person does not feel\r\n    dependent upon, unlike things that may make a person either go ahead or change his plans,\r\n    in which a person is in a sense depending upon it. And Allah knows best.<\/p>\r\n    <p>[9] Kafaarah (expiation) for one who engages in tiyarah. Imaam Ahmad\r\n    reported in his <i>Musnad<\/i> and Ibn al-Sunni also reported with a saheeh isnaad from\r\n    &#145;Abd-Allaah ibn &#145;Amr that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Whoever lets tiyarah stop him from doing something is\r\n    guilty of shirk.&#148; They said, &#147;What is the kafaarah for that?&#148; He said,\r\n    &#147;To say: <i>Allaahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa\r\n    ilaaha ghayruka<\/i> (O Allaah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours,\r\n    and there is no god beside You).&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;&#133; no birds except Yours&#148; means: the birds are part of\r\n    Your creation, they can bring neither benefit nor harm, and the only One Who can bring\r\n    benefit or harm is You, may You be glorified.<\/p>\r\n    <p>[10] Remedies for tatayyur:<\/p>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>(a) tawakkul, which means delegating all one&#146;s affairs to Allaah\r\n      and relying on Him, whilst at the same time taking the necessary means and precautions.\r\n      This is an obligation which must be done purely and sincerely for Allaah, because it is\r\n      one of the best forms of worship and highest levels of Tawheed. Allaah says\r\n      (interpretation of the meanings): <i>&#147;&#133; and put your trust in Allaah, if you are\r\n      believers indeed.&#148; [al-Maa&#146;idah 5:23]<\/i> and <i>&#147;And put yout trust in the\r\n      Ever-Living One Who dies not, and glorify His Praises, and Sufficient is He as the\r\n      All-Knower of the sins of His slaves.&#148; [al-Furqaan 25:58<\/i>]. Putting one&#146;s\r\n      trust in Allaah is one of the greatest and most important ways of getting rid of pessimism\r\n      and superstition and other matters pertaining to shirk.<\/p>\r\n    <\/blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>(b) Knowing that everything that happens, happens by the decree of\r\n      Allaah.

Verily, that is easy for<\/i> <i>Allaah.&#148; [al-Hadeed 57:22]<\/i>.\r\n      Thus a person may be reassured about these matters, and there is no need for tatayyur or\r\n      tiyarah, because good and bad alike are subject to the will and decree of Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <\/blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Istikhaarah.

The\r\n    Prophet himself <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do this or command\r\n    anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. Indeed, he told them not\r\n    to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be\r\n    peace). He said: &ldquo;Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the\r\n    son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, &lsquo;The slave of Allaah and His\r\n    Messenger.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari). What has been\r\n    reported is that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made the day of\r\n    his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting\r\n    on Mondays, and he said: &ldquo;That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I\r\n    was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation.&rdquo; (Reported\r\n    by Muslim, al-Nisaa&rsquo;i and Abu Dawood). <\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, we know that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) were\r\n    the people who loved the Prophet most. Was it reported that Abu Bakr, who was the closest\r\n    of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Was it reported that &lsquo;Umar, who\r\n    ruled for twelve years, or &lsquo;Uthmaan, did this? Was it reported that &lsquo;Ali, his\r\n    relative and foster son, did this? Was it reported that any of the Sahaabah did this? No,\r\n    by Allaah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? No one would say such a thing\r\n    except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Did any of the imaams &ndash; Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafi&rsquo;i,\r\n    Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen &ndash; do this or command others to do it or say\r\n    that it was good? By Allaah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three\r\n    centuries. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a saheeh\r\n    hadeeth: &ldquo;The best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come\r\n    after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not\r\n    care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take\r\n    such matter seriously).&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). The celebration of the Prophet&rsquo;s birthday appeared many centuries later,\r\n    when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bid&rsquo;ah had become\r\n    widespread. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Thus this celebration became a sign of one&rsquo;s love for the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?

What the Qur&rsquo;aan tells us is\r\n    that love of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is demonstrated by\r\n    following the guidance he brought. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;Say (O Muhammad): &lsquo;If you (really) love Allaah, then follow\r\n    me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins.

The second aayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allaah and His\r\n    Messenger. Hence Allaah ended the aayah with a very stern warning in which those who\r\n    refuse to obey are described as kaafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask\r\n    Allaah to keep us safe from that. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The\r\n    celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought &ndash; as\r\n    all the scholars agree. He said: &ldquo;The best of speech is the Book of Allaah, and the\r\n    best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.

When the Muslims became weak in this time, their imitation of \r\n    their enemies became more widespread and many western traditions and customs \r\n    became widespread, whether that has to do with consumer goods or attitudes \r\n    and behaviour.

The festivals which are prescribed in Islam are well \r\n    known to the Muslims: they are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the weekly \r\n    &ldquo;Eid&rdquo; of Jumu&rsquo;ah. There is no other festival in Islam apart from these \r\n    three. All the festivals that have been invented apart from these are to be \r\n    rejected because they are innovations and are false according to the laws of \r\n    Allaah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part \r\n    of it will have it rejected,&rdquo; i.e., it will be thrown back at him and will \r\n    not be accepted by Allaah. According to another version: &ldquo;Whoever does any \r\n    deed that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once this is clear, then it is not permissible to show any of \r\n    the signs of festivity on the celebration mentioned in the question, namely \r\n    Mother&rsquo;s Day. It is not permissible to show joy and happiness, or to offer \r\n    gifts, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim should feel proud of his religion and adhere to \r\n    the limits set by Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) in this religion, which Allaah has chosen for His \r\n    slaves, and he should not add anything or take anything away.

Rather we should say that because we know that they are following \r\n          the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and that they are sincere in advising people, \r\n          if they err with regard to this issue, that error stems from ijtihaad, \r\n          and the mujtahid in this ummah will have two rewards if he reaches the \r\n          right conclusion, and if he makes a mistake then he will have one reward.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Whoever rejects the whole truth (to which \r\n          that person is calling people) because of one mistaken word is misguided, \r\n          especially if the thing that he thinks is a mistake is not actually \r\n          a mistake. Some people, if anyone disagrees with them, say that he is \r\n          mistaken. They may describe him as being mistaken or misguided, or even \r\n          as being a kaafir &ndash; Allaah forbid. This is an extremely bad way of judging \r\n          people. The one who regards people as being kaafirs for any reason or \r\n          for any sin, is following a way that is even harsher than the way of \r\n          the Khawaarij, because the Khawaarij used to regard the one who committed \r\n          a major sin as being a kaafir, not just the one who committed any sin. \r\n          So if there is anyone who regards the Muslims as kaafirs for any sin, \r\n          then he is misguided and is going against the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and \r\n          is more extreme than the Khawaarij whom &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib fought against. \r\n          The Muslims differed as to whether they were to be regarded as kaafirs. \r\n          Some described them as kaafirs (disbelievers) and some described them \r\n          as evildoers and extreme wrongdoers. Does not Allaah say (interpretation \r\n          of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> &ldquo;If \r\n          you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate \r\n          from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. \r\n          Paradise)&rdquo;<br>\r\n          [al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:31]<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>By avoiding major sins, a person may \r\n          be forgiven for minor sins, so long as he does not persist in those \r\n          minor sins. But if he persists in them, then the scholars said that \r\n          persisting in a minor sin makes that a major sin. No doubt the view \r\n          of those who label people as kaafirs because of their sins is misguided, \r\n          and the one who says that the Muslims should be regarded as kaafirs \r\n          because of their sins should note that the Messenger SAWS (peace and \r\n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever calls his brother a \r\n          kaafir &ndash; when that is not the case &ndash; it will come back on him.&rdquo; This \r\n          is what the Messenger said, so even if that person is not regarded as \r\n          a kaafir in this world, he may become a kaafir in the sight of Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: Al-Liqaa&rsquo; al-Shahri, 15 by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)"},{"id":"10471","question_id":"10471","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise \r\n          be to Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about the intention \r\n          when starting to do an act of worship such as praying etc., do we need \r\n          to utter it verbally, such as saying, &ldquo;I intend to pray, I intend to \r\n          fast&rdquo;?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Praise be to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The intention of purifying oneself by doing wudoo&rsquo; ghusl \r\n          or tayammum, of praying, fasting, paying zakaah, offering kafaarah (expiation) \r\n          and other acts of worship does not need to be uttered verbally, according \r\n          to the consensus of the imaams of Islam. Rather the place of intention \r\n          is the heart, according to the consensus among them. If a person utters \r\n          something by mistake that goes against what is in his heart, then what \r\n          counts is what he intended, not what he said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          No one has mentioned any difference of opinion concerning \r\n          this matter, except that some of the later followers of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i \r\n          expressed approval of that, but some of the leaders of this madhhab \r\n          said that this was wrong. But in the dispute among the scholars as to \r\n          whether it is mustahabb to utter one&rsquo;s intention, there are two points \r\n          of view. Some of the companions of Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad \r\n          said that it is mustahabb to utter the intention so as to make it stronger.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Some of the companions of Maalik, Ahmad and others said \r\n          that it is not mustahabb to utter it, because that is a bid&rsquo;ah (innovation). \r\n          It was not narrated that the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his Sahaabah did it or \r\n          that he commanded anyone among his ummah to utter the intention. That \r\n          is not known from any of the Muslims. If that had been prescribed then \r\n          the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions would \r\n          not have neglected it, as it has to do with worship which the ummah \r\n          does every day and night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          This is the more correct view. Indeed, uttering the intention \r\n          is a of irrational thinking and falling short in religious commitment. \r\n          In terms of falling short in religious commitment, that is because it \r\n          is bid&rsquo;ah (an innovation). In terms of irrational thinking, that is \r\n          because it is like a person who wants to eat some food saying, &ldquo;I intend \r\n          to put my hand in this vessel, take out a morsel of food, put it in \r\n          my mouth and chew it, then swallow it, and eat until I have had my fill.&rdquo; \r\n          This is sheer foolishness and ignorance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Intention is connected to knowledge. If a person knows \r\n          what he is doing then he has obviously made an intention. It cannot \r\n          be imagined, if he knows what he wants to do, that he has not formed \r\n          an intention. The imaams are agreed that speaking the intention out \r\n          loud and repeating it is not prescribed in Islam, rather the person \r\n          who has made this a habit should be disciplined and told not to worship \r\n          Allaah by following bid&rsquo;ah and not to disturb others by raising his \r\n          voice.

If it is a bid&#8217;ah which constitutes \r\n          kufr, then it is obligatory to boycott the person who does it. If it \r\n          is of a lesser degree than that, then it is essential to examine the \r\n          situation further. If something may be achieved by boycotting the person, \r\n          then we do it; if no purpose will be served by it, or if it will only \r\n          make him more disobedient and arrogant, then we should avoid doing that, \r\n          because whatever serves no purpose, it is better not to do it. And also \r\n          in principle it is haraam to boycott a believer, because the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) said: &#8216;It is not permissible for a man to forsake [not \r\n          speak to] his brother for more than three [days].&#8217;&#8221;&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>(Adapted from <i>Majmoo&#8217; \r\n          Fataawa Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen<\/i>, vol. 2, p. 293)&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>B.<span> \r\n          <\/span><i>Shirk<\/i>, its types and the definition of each&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Shaykh Muhammad ibn \r\n          &#8216;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>&#8220;<i>Shirk<\/i> is of \r\n          two types, major <i>shirk<\/i> which puts a person beyond the pale of \r\n          Islam, and lesser <i>shirk<\/i>.&#8221;&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The first type, major \r\n          shirk, is &#8220;Every type of <i>shirk<\/i> which the Lawgiver described as \r\n          such and which puts a person beyond the pale of his religion&#8221; &#8211; such \r\n          as devoting any kind of act of worship which should be for Allaah to \r\n          someone other than Allaah, such as praying to anyone other than Allaah, \r\n          fasting for anyone other than Allaah or offering a sacrifice to anyone \r\n          other than Allaah. It is also a form of major <i>shirk<\/i> to offer \r\n          supplication (<i>du&#8217;aa&#8217;<\/i>) to anyone other than Allaah, such as calling \r\n          upon the occupant of a grave or calling upon one who is absent to help \r\n          one in some way in which no one is able to help except Allaah.&nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The second type is \r\n          minor <i>shirk<\/i>, which means every kind of speech or action that \r\n          Islam describes as <i>shirk<\/i>, but it does not put a person beyond \r\n          the pale of Islam &#8211; such as swearing an oath by something other than \r\n          Allaah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that whoever swears an oath \r\n          by something other than Allaah is guilty of <i>kufr<\/i> or <i>shirk<\/i>.&#8221;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The one who swears \r\n          an oath by something other than Allaah but does not believe that anyone \r\n          other than Allaah has the same greatness as Allah, is a <i>mushrik<\/i> \r\n          who is guilty of lesser <i>shirk<\/i>, regardless of whether the one \r\n          by whom he swore is venerated by people or not. It is not permissible \r\n          to swear by the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or by the president, or by the \r\n          Ka&#8217;bah, or by Jibreel, because this is <i>shirk<\/i>, but it is minor \r\n          <i>shirk<\/i> which does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam.&nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Another type of minor \r\n          <i>shirk<\/i> is showing off, which means that a person does something \r\n          so that people will see it, not for the sake of Allaah.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The ways in which showing \r\n          off may cancel out acts of worship are either of the following:&nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>The first is when it is applies to an act \r\n          of worship from the outset, i.e., the person is not doing that action \r\n          for any reason other than showing off. In this case, the action is invalid \r\n          and is rejected, because of the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which was attributed \r\n          to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n          of Allaah be upon him), which says that Allaah said, &#8220;I am so self-sufficient \r\n          that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action \r\n          for someone else&#8217;s sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced \r\n          by Me to him whom he associated with Me.&#8221;<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>(Narrated by Muslim, \r\n          <i>Kitaab al-Zuhd<\/i>, no. 2985)&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The second is when \r\n          the showing off happens later on during the act of worship, i.e., the \r\n          action is originally for Allaah, then showing off creeps into it. This \r\n          may be one of two cases:&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>The first \r\n          is when the person resists it &#8211; this does not harm him.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>For example, a man \r\n          has prayed a rak&#8217;ah, then some people come along during his second rak&#8217;ah \r\n          and it occurs to him to make the rukoo&#8217; or sujood longer, or makes himself \r\n          weep, and so on. If he resists that, it does not harm him, because he \r\n          is striving against this idea. But if he goes along with that, then \r\n          every action which stemmed from showing off is invalid, such as if he \r\n          made his standing or prostration long, or he made himself weep &#8211; all \r\n          of those actions will be cancelled out. But does this invalidation extend \r\n          to the entire act of worship or not?&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>We say that either \r\n          of the following must apply:&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>Either the \r\n          end of his act of worship was connected to the beginning (with no pause); \r\n          so if the end of it is invalidated then all of it is invalidated.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>This is the case with \r\n          the prayer &#8211; the last part of it cannot be invalidated without the first \r\n          part also being invalidated, so the whole prayer is invalid.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Or if the beginning \r\n          of the action is separate from the end of it, then the first part is \r\n          valid but the latter part is not. Whatever came before the showing off \r\n          is valid, and what came after it is not valid.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>An example of that \r\n          is a man who has a hundred riyals, and gives fifty of them in charity \r\n          for the sake of Allaah with a sound intention, then he gives fifty in \r\n          charity for the purpose of showing off. The first fifty are accepted, \r\n          and the second fifty are not accepted, because the latter is separate \r\n          from the former.&#8221; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawa \r\n          wa Rasaa&#8217;il Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen<\/i>, and <i>al-Qawl al-Mufeed Sharh Kitaab \r\n          al-Tawheed<\/i>, vol. 1, p. 114, 1<sup>st<\/sup> edition<span> <\/span><\/big>\r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10473","question_id":"10473","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>The root of the word bid&rsquo;ah in Arabic means\r\n      initiating something without any precedent.

They loved the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) far more than we do, yet \r\n    despite that they did not celebrate this day. Hence we do not celebrate this \r\n    day, in obedience to the command of Allaah Who has commanded us to follow \r\n    the commands of His Prophet. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&#8220;And whatsoever the \r\n    Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, \r\n    abstain (from it)&#8221; [al-Hashr 59:7]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#8220;I urge you to adhere to \r\n    my Sunnah [way] and the way of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs.

And beware of newly-invented matters [in religion], \r\n    for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a \r\n    going-astray.&#8221; (Narrated by Abu Dawood, <i>al-Sunnah<\/i>, 3991; classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, no. 3851).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The extent to which a \r\n    person loves the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) is to be seen in how he follows him with regard to all that he \r\n    commanded or forbade. That includes following him in not celebrating the day \r\n    on which he was born. See question no. 5219, \r\n    10070.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whoever wants to venerate \r\n    the day on which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) was born should follow the alternative that is based on Islamic \r\n    evidence, which is that one should fast on Mondays, not just the day that he \r\n    was born but every Monday.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Abu \r\n    Qutaadah al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about \r\n    fasting on Mondays. He said, &#8220;On that day I was born and on that day the \r\n    Revelation came to me.&#8221; (Narrated by Muslim, 1978). On Thursdays deeds are \r\n    taken up and shown to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Conclusion: celebrating \r\n    the Prophet&#8217;s birthday was not prescribed by Allaah or by the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so it is not \r\n    permissible for the Muslims to celebrate his birthday, in obedience to the \r\n    command of Allaah and the command of His Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him). <br>\r\n    We ask Allaah to guide you to the Straight Path.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br><br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10476","question_id":"10476","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be\r\nupon his truthful Prophet. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, how can there be any such thing as bid&#146;ah hasanah\r\n(&#147;good innovation&#148;) when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\nhim) said: &#147;Every bid&#146;ah is a going astray and every going astray is in\r\nHell-fire&#148;.&nbsp; So, if anyone says that there is such a thing as bid&#146;ah\r\nhasanah, he can only be insisting on going against the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n(peace and\r\nblessings of Allaah be upon him).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, saying &#147;al-hamdu Lillaah&#133; (praise be to\r\nAllaah&#133;) when coming out of rukoo&#146; is a well-known phrase of dhikr which is\r\nproven in sound ahaadeeth reported from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\nupon him). All that this Sahaabi did was to come up with a new phrase expressing praise to\r\nAllaah. How can this be used as evidence to support innovations in worship and dhikr that\r\nhave no basis in the sources of Islam?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, what this Sahaabi did cannot be taken as evidence in and of itself. It was not even considered to have been a correct action until after the Prophet  <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had approved it, and not before. But how on earth could this innovator obtain the approval of the Prophet <img>\r\n(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he has passed away?\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourthly, if we accept the use of this report as evidence, it is still no more than an\r\nisolated incident which cannot be generalized, whereas the hadeeth &#147;every bid&#146;ah\r\nis a going astray&#148; is clearly a general statement. It is a well-known principle among\r\nthe &#145;ulamaa&#146; (scholars) that what is stated clearly takes precedence over what\r\nis merely implied.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifthly, how can we know what is good or not with our limited minds alone and without\r\nthe input of Revelation? Is there not the possibility of differences of opinion? What one\r\nperson sees as good will be seen differently by another, so what would the standard be?\r\nWhose reasoning could we rely on or refer to? Would this not be confusion, even anarchy\r\nitself?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixthly (which confirms the third point made above), when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\nblessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of an act of worship or a dhikr (remembrance of\r\nAllaah) on the part of one of his Sahaabah, it would thus become a part of sharee&#146;ah\r\nand hence be regarded as a sunnah hasanah. But with the death of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\nand blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the ceasing of Revelation, how can we know\r\nwhether innovated acts of worship or dhikr are correct or would be approved? We have no\r\nway of knowing, so we should limit ourselves only to the forms of worship that have been\r\nnarrated in sound reports.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great scholar al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated many\r\ncomments by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Fath al-Baari; he agreed with some and\r\ndisagreed with others. This is the business of the scholars: they discuss and debate with\r\none another, with the aim of reaching the truth &#150; which may lie with the one who is\r\ndisagreeing or with the one whose opinion is being criticized. As for the unpleasant\r\ncomment quoted in the question, from what we know of Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on\r\nhim) and his good manners, fear of Allaah, awareness of the value of knowledge and respect\r\nfor the scholars, we are sure that this comment is a fabrication.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may be seen in a dream, \r\n    and the one who sees him in his true form has indeed seen him, because the Shaytaan cannot appear in his form, as it says in the saheeh hadeeth. \r\n    But it all depends on the faith, sincerity, good character, accuracy, religious commitment and trustworthiness of the one who claims to have seen \r\n    him, and whether he saw the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his true form or in some other form. If there is a hadeeth \r\n    that was narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who supposedly said it during his lifetime, but it is not \r\n    transmitted by trustworthy men of good character, it cannot be accepted or used as evidence; or it is transmitted by trustworthy and accurate \r\n    narrators, but it goes against a report narrated by stronger narrators and cannot possibly be reconciled with that more accurate and more \r\n    trustworthy report, then one of them is abrogated and cannot be followed, and the second one abrogates it and is to be followed wherever possible \r\n    and when its conditions are met. If that is not possible and they cannot be reconciled, then the report which is less reliable should be rejected. \r\n    The ruling in this case is that it is odd (shaadhdh) and should not be followed. So how about a letter whose author, who supposedly narrated it \r\n    from the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), is unknown and it is not known whether he is trustworthy or not? In \r\n    this case it should be rejected and no attention should be paid to it, even if it contains nothing that goes against sharee&rsquo;ah, so how about if \r\n    the letter contains many things that indicate that it is false and that it is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it includes rulings [?] that Allaah has not permitted? The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever attributes words to me that I did not say, let him take his place in Hell.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan wrote an article \r\n    about this letter, warning against it, which was published in <i>al-Da&rsquo;wah<\/i> magazine, issue no. 1082, in which he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This fabricated letter is old. It appeared in Egypt more than eighty years ago, and the \r\n    scholars refuted it and ruled it to be false, and they pointed out the lies and falsehoods it contains. One of the scholars was Shaykh Muhammad \r\n    Rasheed Rida, who said in his refutation of this letter:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We answered this question in 1322 AH, and we \r\n    remember that we have seen something like this letter many times from when we were learning how to read and write until now. All of them are \r\n    attributed to a man called Shaykh Ahmad, the Watchman of the Prophet&rsquo;s Tomb. The letter is definitely false, and no one who has had the faintest \r\n    whiff of knowledge and religion would dispute that. Rather it is only the simple-minded among the illiterate masses who believe it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then he refuted it at length, refuting each \r\n    fabrication contained in the letter. Moreover this letter has been warmly accepted by some of the ignorant, and they started to print it and \r\n    distribute it, because they were influenced by the promises and warnings contained therein, because this immoral person who composed it said that \r\n    whoever makes x number of copies and distributes it will get what he wants, and if he is a sinner Allaah will forgive him, and if he is employed \r\n    he will be promoted, and if he is in debt his debt will be paid off, and whoever disbelieves it will be humiliated and such and such bad \r\n    consequences will come to him. When some of the ignorant read this, they are affected by it and they go ahead and distribute it out of fear and \r\n    greed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The scholars have stated that this letter is \r\n    false and they have warned people against distributing it and believing in it. These scholars include Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz, who refuted \r\n    it in an excellent article and pointed out the lies and deception that it contains. This letter is false for a number of reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly: <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>the rulings of Islam, the promises and \r\n    warnings, and information about what the future holds are all matters that can only be proven through revelation from Allaah to His Messenger. \r\n    Revelation came to an end when the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, after Allaah had perfected the religion \r\n    through him. We have inherited the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah which are sufficient to guide us. As for dreams and visions, they do not prove anything, \r\n    because most of them are the fabrications of the devils, aimed at leading people astray from their religion. The fabricators of this letter \r\n    promise those who believe in it that they will enter Paradise and that their needs will be met and they will be relieved of distress, and they \r\n    warn those who disbelieve in it that they will go to Hell and be humiliated. This is prescribing a new religion and telling lies against Allaah &ndash; \r\n    we seek refuge with Allaah from that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly: <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fabricator of this letter makes it \r\n    greater than the Qur&rsquo;aan, because one who copies the Qur&rsquo;aan and sends it from one country to another will not get the reward which this liar says \r\n    the one who distributes this letter will get; and the one who does not copy the Qur&rsquo;aan and send it from one country to another will not be denied \r\n    the intercession of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if he is a believer &ndash; so how can the believer be denied \r\n    intercession if he does not copy this letter and send it from one country to another as this fabricator says?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This letter makes a claim to have knowledge \r\n    of the unseen, as it says in it: &ldquo;this Friday about six thousand (6,000) people Died but none of them went to heaven&rdquo;. This is a claim to have \r\n    knowledge of the unseen which no one knows except Allaah, for He is the One Who knows how many people die in Islam and how many die in kufr. \r\n    Whoever claims to have knowledge of the unseen is a kaafir who disbelieves in Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fourthly:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Reward and punishment in this world and in \r\n    the Hereafter can only be proven by a text from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger. This fabricator says that those who believe in \r\n    this letter will be rewarded and those who disbelieve in it and do not distribute it will be punished. Allaah has proven it to be a lie &ndash; praise \r\n    be to Allaah &ndash; because many Muslims have disbelieved in it and believed it to be a forgery, and nothing but good has happened to them, whilst \r\n    those who believed in it and distributed it have been met with nothing but disappointment and loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Moreover this fabricator wants to make the \r\n    masses and the ignorant believe in this letter, so he swears an oath by Allaah repeatedly, that he is sincere and that his letter is true, and \r\n    that if he is lying, may he exit this world following a religion other than Islam. He wants to make a show of loving Islam and hating sin and \r\n    evil, so that people will think well of him and believe him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is part of his evil scheming, and indeed \r\n    of his stupidity and ignorance. Swearing and making repeated oaths does not indicate that everyone who does so is sincere. Many liars swear oaths \r\n    in order to deceive the people. Iblees swore to our parents [Adam and Hawwa &ndash; peace be upon them], &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, I am one of the sincere \r\n    well-wishers for you both&rdquo; <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[ al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:21 &ndash; interpretation of the \r\n    meaning]. <\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah said to His Prophet \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And (O Muhammad) obey you not everyone \r\n    Hallaaf Maheen (the one who swears much and is a liar or is worthless)&rdquo; <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Qalam 68:10]. <\/i>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah tells us that the hypocrites swear \r\n    when telling lies, and they do that knowingly, as He says of them (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;they will indeed swear that their \r\n    intention is nothing but good. Allaah bears witness that they are certainly liars&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Tawbah 9:107]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Does this ignorant fool think that if he \r\n    fabricates lies against Allaah and His Messenger in this letter and swears at the end of it, that the Muslims will believe him and accept his \r\n    words? No way! As for his making a show of feeling proud of Islam and being pained by evil deeds, this is a kind of statement which is aimed at \r\n    making people think well of him and accept what he says, but he does not realize that the accursed Pharaoh made a show of being sincere and kind \r\n    to his people when he said, preventing them from following Moosa (peace be upon him),&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;I fear that he may change your religion, \r\n    or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Ghaafir 40:26 &ndash; interpretation of the \r\n    meaning]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Not everyone who appears to be offering \r\n    advice and to be proud of Islam is sincere. The warnings against evil and sin that are narrated in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and their descriptions \r\n    of the resulting punishments are sufficient for those who have faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Perhaps someone may ask, what is the goal of \r\n    the author of this letter? What is the motive that made him fabricate it and distribute it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The answer is that his goal is to mislead \r\n    people away from the Book of their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet, and towards myths and false stories. If they believe him in this and it \r\n    becomes widely accepted among them, then he will invent more and more for them, so that they will be distracted by that from the Qur&rsquo;aan and \r\n    Sunnah, then it will be easy to introduce more false ideas to them and change their beliefs. For so long as the Muslims adhere to the Book of \r\n    their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet, those who seek to misguide them will never be able to divert them away from their religion, but if \r\n    they forsake the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and believe in myths and stories and devilish dreams, it will be easy for any misleader and heretic to lead \r\n    them astray. There may be secret kaafir organizations behind this, who are working to distribute these fabrications in order to lead the Muslims \r\n    astray from their religion. This is indicated by the fact that this myth has been around for a century, and it is unlikely that its inventor is \r\n    still alive. So if there were not someone working to distribute it after his death, it would not have appeared. So beware, O Muslims, of believing \r\n    in these fabrications. Do not distribute them amongst yourselves, and ask the scholars about anything that you do not understand.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The enemies of Allaah and His Messenger among \r\n    the kaafirs, hypocrites and devils of the jinn and mankind are always trying to lead people astray from the true religion and make them follow \r\n    false religions; to lead them astray from the path that leads to Paradise and make them follow the path that leads to Hell, from following the \r\n    Messengers to following the devils and those who lead people astray. So they used to distort the laws of the Prophets and alter the Books that \r\n    were revealed to the Messengers, as they did with the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel). When Allaah sent the Seal of the Prophets &ndash; Muhammad \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &ndash; and revealed to him the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan and the straight path, He guaranteed to preserve the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and protect it from being changed and altered. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down \r\n    the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur&rsquo;aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Hijr 15:9]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Falsehood cannot come to it from before \r\n    it or behind it, (it is) sent down by <span>the All&#8209;Wise, Worthy of all praise<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Fussilat 41:42]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And He protected the Sunnah of His Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from the lies of the liars by means of the keen efforts of the trustworthy scholars who preserved \r\n    it and transmitted it, and eliminated the fabrications of the liars who tried to interfere with it. So they set out guidelines and principles by \r\n    means of which the saheeh (sound) hadeeths could be distinguished from false hadeeths, and they compiled the saheeh hadeeths and protected them, \r\n    and they listed the false hadeeths and fought them and warned people against them. Because the enemies of Allaah and His Messenger were unable to \r\n    introduce false ideas into the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, they resorted to attempting to divert the people away from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and distract them with false stories and alleged dreams, filled with false promises and warnings which may tempt and deceive \r\n    those who are weak in faith and ignorant, and lead many of them into shirk and heresy and innovation in the name of religion, worship and \r\n    asceticism, following these myths.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The way of these deviants is not based on the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, rather it is based on false stories and so-called dreams. So they go astray from true guidance and forsake the Book of Allaah \r\n    and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and pay heed to the whispers of the Shaytaan. This is the recompense of the one who turns away from the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    and Sunnah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And whosoever turns away blindly from the \r\n    remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allaah) (i.e. this Qur&rsquo;aan and worship of Allaah), We appoint for him Shaytaan (Satan &#8209; devil) to be a Qareen (a \r\n    companion) to him.<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And verily, they (Satans \/ devils) hinder them from the path (of Allaah), but they think that \r\n    they are guided aright!&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Zukhruf 43:36]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So fear Allaah, O slaves of Allaah, and \r\n    adhere to the Book of your Lord and the Sunnah of your Prophet, and beware of false ideas propagated by the enemies of Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>May Allaah help us all to adhere to the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.

If it is their custom to eat this specific \r\n    food or they make it for that festival, unlike their habits at other times \r\n    of the year, then buying and selling it, and eating it or giving it as a \r\n    gift, on that day, is part of celebrating that festival or establishing it. \r\n    So it is better for you not to do that on the day of the celebration. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> there is a discussion \r\n    to do with Valentine&rsquo;s Day and buying sweets that have been coloured red and \r\n    on which hearts are drawn, as an expression of celebrating that innovated \r\n    festival.

Any \r\n    festivals other than these, whether they are connected to a person, a group, \r\n    an incident or anything lese, are innovated festivals and it is not \r\n    permissible for the Muslims to celebrate them or approve of them, express \r\n    joy on them or help with them in any way, because that is transgressing the \r\n    sacred limits of Allaah, and whoever transgresses the sacred limits of \r\n    Allaah has wronged himself. &hellip; It is also haraam for a Muslim to help with \r\n    this festival or any other haraam festivals in any way, whether it has to do \r\n    with food, drink, selling, buying, manufacturing, giving, corresponding, \r\n    announcing or anything else, because all of that is cooperating in sin and \r\n    transgression and disobedience to Allaah and to the Messenger of Allaah, \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Help you one another in Al&#8209;Birr and At&#8209;Taqwa (virtue, \r\n    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \r\n    transgression.

The innovation that \r\n    we were warned against is that which is done as an act of worship to bring \r\n    one closer to Allah, may He be exalted, (that was not done by the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or prescribed in Islam). This is \r\n    the guideline concerning the definition of innovation.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is not permissible to seek to draw closer \r\n    to Allah by doing an act of worship that was not prescribed for us by the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is what \r\n    we understand from the Prophet&rsquo;'s prohibition on innovation. Innovation or \r\n    bid&lsquo;ah means seeking to draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, by means of \r\n    that which He has not prescribed. Hence Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Any act of worship that was not done by the Companions of the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), do not seek \r\n    to worship Allah thereby.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Concerning such matters, Imam Maalik (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;That which was not part of the religion at \r\n    that time cannot be part of the religion today.&rdquo; In other words, that which \r\n    was not part of the religion at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) and he did not seek to draw close to Allah by means of \r\n    it, cannot be part of the religion after that.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Moreover, this example that is mentioned by \r\n    the questioner, which is the science of al-jarh wa&rsquo;t-ta&lsquo;deel (evaluation of \r\n    hadeeth narrators), and his argument that it is an innovation that is not \r\n    blameworthy, is an opinion upheld by those who divide innovation into good \r\n    innovation and bad innovation; then they go further than that and divide \r\n    innovations into the five classifications of rulings (obligatory (waajib), \r\n    recommended (mustahabb), permissible (mubaah), prohibited (haraam) and \r\n    disliked (makrooh)). This classification was mentioned by al-&lsquo;Izz ibn &lsquo;Abd \r\n    as-Salaam (may Allah have mercy on him); he was followed in that by his \r\n    student al-Qarraafi. Ash-Shaatibi responded to al-Qarraafi&rsquo;s approval of \r\n    this classification by stating:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>&nbsp;This classification is something that has \r\n    been made up and there is no evidence for it in sharee&lsquo;ah. Rather it is \r\n    self-contradictory, because part of the definition of innovation is that \r\n    there is no evidence for it in sharee&lsquo;ah, whether in the texts of sharee&lsquo;ah \r\n    or in the basic principles. If there was something in sharee&lsquo;ah to indicate \r\n    that something is obligatory or recommended or permissible, then in that \r\n    case it would not be an innovation and the action would be included under \r\n    the general heading of actions that are enjoined or are optional. So \r\n    referring to these things as bid&lsquo;ah then stating that the evidence may \r\n    indicate whether they are obligatory or recommended or permissible means \r\n    that one is contradicting oneself.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>With regard to describing some innovations \r\n    as disliked (makrooh) and prohibited (haraam), this is correct, on the \r\n    grounds that they are innovations, and not for any other reason. If there is \r\n    evidence to indicate that something is not allowed or is disliked, that does \r\n    not prove that it is an innovation, because there is the possibility that it \r\n    may be a sin, such as murder, stealing, drinking alcohol, and so on. There \r\n    is no innovation in which it can be imagined that this classification \r\n    applies at all, except in the case of what is disliked and prohibited, \r\n    according to this argument.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>What was narrated by al-Qarraafi from his \r\n    companions about consensus on denunciation of innovations is correct, but \r\n    his classification thereof is not correct. It is very strange that he \r\n    narrated that there was consensus at the time when he was producing a \r\n    counter-argument on this issue, which would imply that there was no \r\n    consensus. It is as if he was only following his shaykh &ndash; i.e., Ibn &lsquo;Abd \r\n    as-Salaam &ndash; with regard to this classification, without examining it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Then he mentioned the reason that al-&lsquo;Izz \r\n    ibn &lsquo;Abd as-Salaam (may Allah have mercy on him) gave for this \r\n    classification and that he called the concept of <i>al-masaalih al-mursalah<\/i> \r\n    (consideration of public interest) an innovation, then he said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>As for al-Qarraafi, he has no excuse for \r\n    transmitting that classification in a way other than his shaykh intended and \r\n    other than the people intended, because he differed from everyone else with \r\n    regard to that classification, so he went against consensus.

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The worst of matters are those which are newly invented (in \r\n    religion). Every newly invented matter is an innovation, every innovation is \r\n    a going astray, and every going astray is in the Fire.&rdquo; With regard to these \r\n    soorahs and adhkaar (dhikrs) that are mentioned in the question, this is \r\n    something for which there is no evidence (daleel), and it is not permissible \r\n    to do these things for which there is no evidence in the Book of our Lord or \r\n    the Sunnah of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is prescribed in our religion is to offer supplication \r\n    (du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;) for the sick person and to ask Allah to heal him and purify him. \r\n    That will have the greatest impact in taking away the disease and bringing \r\n    about rapid healing. It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Whoever visits a sick person whose time (of death) has not yet come, and \r\n    says to him seven times &lsquo;<i>As&rsquo;al Allah al-&lsquo;Azeem Rabb al-&lsquo;Arsh al-&lsquo;Azeem an \r\n    yashfeeyaka<\/i> (I ask Allah the Almighty, Lord of the Mighty Throne, to \r\n    heal you)&rsquo;, Allah will heal him of that sickness.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (2137), Abu Dawood (3106) and at-Tirmidhi \r\n    (2083); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you should offer supplication (du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;) for him in the \r\n    wording mentioned in this hadeeth and other saheeh hadeeths.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to giving charity. There is no doubt that \r\n    spending for the sake of Allah is something that brings good. It was \r\n    narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) <i>said: \r\n    &ldquo;There is no day on which people wake up, but two angels come down and one \r\n    of them says: &lsquo;O Allaah, give more to the one who spends,&rsquo; and the other \r\n    says, &lsquo;O Allaah, send destruction upon the one who withholds.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1442) and Muslim (1010).<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So spend and give charity, and be optimistic about \r\n    compensation from Allah, may He be glorified.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to praying behind an innovator, Shaykh al-Islam \r\n    [Ibn Taymiyah] said in <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (23\/355):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to praying behind an innovator, this is a matter \r\n    concerning which there is a difference of opinion and it is subject to \r\n    further discussion. If you cannot find any other imam apart from him, such \r\n    as in the case of Jumu&lsquo;ah prayer which is only held in one place, or Eid \r\n    prayer, or prayers during Hajj behind the imam who is in charge of Hajj, \r\n    these prayers are to be offered behind anyone, whether he is righteous or \r\n    otherwise, according to the consensus of Ahl as-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&lsquo;ah. Rather \r\n    the ones who refrain from offering these prayers behind the imams are the \r\n    followers of innovations such as the Raafidis and others like them, who do \r\n    not attend any Jumu&lsquo;ah prayer or prayer in congregation. If there is only \r\n    one mosque in the village, then praying in congregation behind an immoral \r\n    person is better than praying on one&rsquo;s own at home, lest that lead to giving \r\n    up prayer in congregation altogether. But if it is possible to pray behind \r\n    someone other than the innovator, that is undoubtedly better and preferable. \r\n    But if he prays behind him, there is a scholarly difference of opinion \r\n    concerning his prayer. The view of ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i and Abu Haneefah is that his \r\n    prayer is valid; however in the madhhabs of Maalik and Ahmad there is a \r\n    dispute concerning this issue and it is subject to further discussion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    However this only applies to bid&lsquo;ah that is known to be \r\n    contrary to the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah, such as the innovations of the Raafidis, \r\n    Jahamis and so on. People argue about many issue of religion in this \r\n    country, and both parties to an argument may innovators, and both of them \r\n    may be ignorant and misinterpreting things, so the refusal of one of them to \r\n    pray behind the other is not better than if it is the other way round. But \r\n    once the Sunnah is established and becomes known, and one person or group \r\n    goes against it, this is the matter concerning which there is a difference \r\n    of scholarly opinion. And Allah knows best.

Al-Najm \r\n    al-Ghayti said, describing spending the night of al-Nisf min Sh&lsquo;baan \r\n    (mid-Sha&lsquo;baan) praying in congregation: That was denounced by most of the \r\n    scholars of the Hijaz, including &lsquo;Ata&rsquo; and Ibn Abi Mulaykah, the fuqaha&rsquo; of \r\n    Madinah and the companions of Maalik. They said: All of that is an \r\n    innovation (bid&lsquo;ah) and there is no report to suggest that the Prophet spent \r\n    that night in praying in congregation or that his Companions did that \r\n    either.

It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;The days of at-Tashreeq are days of eating and drinking and \r\n    remembering Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.&rdquo; This refers to the \r\n    three days following Eid al-Adha, when the people offer their sacrifices and \r\n    eat from the meat and enjoy the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon them. \r\n    Similarly, on Eid al-Fitr there is nothing wrong with expressing joy and \r\n    happiness so long as it does not overstep the limits set by Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for expressing joy on the night of the twenty-seventh of \r\n    Rajab or the fifteenth of Sha&lsquo;baan or the day of &lsquo;Ashoora&rsquo;, this is \r\n    something for which there is no basis. Rather it is forbidden and the Muslim \r\n    should not attend if he is invited to such celebrations. The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Beware of newly invented \r\n    matters, for every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid&lsquo;ah), and \r\n    every innovation is a going astray.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab is what some people \r\n    claim is the night of the Mi&lsquo;raaj during which the Messenger (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) was taken up to Allah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted.

As for the one who says that \r\n    night of the Isra&rsquo; is better than Laylat al-Qadr:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If what he meant was that the night on which the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was taken on the Night Journey \r\n    and similar nights of every year are better for the ummah of Muhammad \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) than Laylat al-Qadr in that \r\n    praying qiyaam and offering supplication on this night is better than doing \r\n    that on Laylat al-Qadr, this is false. None of the Muslims said that and it \r\n    is well known that this view is incorrect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This applies if it is known which night is the night of the \r\n    Isra&rsquo;, so how about if there is no known evidence of which month it happened \r\n    in or which part of the month or which night? Rather the reports concerning \r\n    that are munqati&lsquo; and contradictory, and there is nothing that can be taken \r\n    as definitive. It is not prescribed for the Muslims to single out the night \r\n    which is thought to be the night of the Isra&rsquo; for qiyaam or anything else, \r\n    unlike Laylat al-Qadr. It is not known that any of the Muslims ascribed to \r\n    the night of the Isra&rsquo; any superiority over other nights, especially Laylat \r\n    al-Qadr. The Sahaabah and those who followed them in truth did not single \r\n    out the night of the Isra&rsquo; in any way and they did not mention it. Hence it \r\n    is not known what night it was. If the Isra&rsquo; was one of the greatest virtues \r\n    of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) but despite that \r\n    it is not prescribed to single out that time or that place for any \r\n    prescribed act of worship, or to single out the day on which the Revelation \r\n    came down for any act of worship or anything else, or to single out the \r\n    place and time in which the Revelation began for anything. The one who \r\n    singles out places or times on the basis of his own ideas for acts of \r\n    worship for this and similar reasons is like the People of the Book who make \r\n    the times of the life of the Messiah into special occasions for worship, \r\n    such as the day of his birth, the day of his baptism and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Zaad al-Ma&lsquo;aad fi Hadiy Khayr al-&lsquo;Ibaad<\/i>, \r\n    1\/56-58.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information please see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]60288[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatout]105456[\\fatout].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10501","question_id":"10501","answers":"<p><span>Praise\r\nbe to Allah.<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>There\r\nis nothing wrong with buying this candy at a time other than the celebration,\r\nbecause that is not regarded as participating in the celebration or helping\r\nwith it.<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>For\r\nmore information see the answer to question no. <a>90026<\/a><o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p><span>And Allah knows best.<o><\/o:p><\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10502","question_id":"10502","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your fast is valid and you do not have to make up anything, \r\n    because you are not certain as to whether you swallowed any of this child's \r\n    saliva, and an act of worship cannot be invalidated in the case of \r\n    uncertainty.

No. Rather \r\n    we say: Take a middle approach &ndash; do not make yourself vomit and do not try \r\n    to stop it, because if you make yourself vomit you will break the fast, but if you try to stop it, that will harm you.

The evidence that the one who is ignorant of the ruling does not \r\n    break his fast is the report that is proven in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> from the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that \r\n    he put two ropes &ndash; one black and one white &ndash; beneath his pillow.

The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari from \r\n    Asma&rsquo; bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: We broke our \r\n    fast on a cloudy day at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him), then the sun came out. The point here is that if the \r\n    fast was invalidated, it would have been obligatory to make it up, and if it \r\n    had been obligatory to make it up, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) would have commanded them to do that. If he had ordered \r\n    them to make it up, this would have reached us because it is part of \r\n    preserving sharee&rsquo;ah.

He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person vomits deliberately, this breaks the fast, but if \r\n    it was not deliberate then this does not break the fast.

No, but we do say: take a neutral stance. Do not try to make it \r\n    happen and do not try to prevent it, because if you make yourself vomit you \r\n    will have broken your fast, but if you try to prevent it you will harm \r\n    yourself.

He has to repent, complete that day (i.e., not eat or drink until sunset), make up that day&rsquo;s fast later on \r\n    and offer a severe expiation. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: A man came \r\n    to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, &ldquo;I am doomed, O Messenger of Allaah!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Why are you doomed?&rdquo; He \r\n    said, &ldquo;I had intercourse with my wife (during the day) in Ramadaan.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Can you free a slave?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Can you fast for \r\n    two consecutive months?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1936; Muslim, 1111.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>No expiation is required for any of the things that break the fast apart from \r\n    intercourse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>The second of the things that invalidate the fast is masturbation.<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This means causing ejaculation or climax by using the hand etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The evidence that masturbation is one of the things that invalidate the fast is \r\n    the words of Allaah in the hadeeth qudsi in which He says of the fasting person: &ldquo;He gives up his food and drink and desire for My sake.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by al-Bukhaari, 1894; Muslim, 1151.

The fasting person should keep away from \r\n    everything that provokes desire and shun bad thoughts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid), the most correct view is \r\n    that it does not invalidate the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The third of the things that invalidate the fast is eating or \r\n    drinking&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>This refers to food or drink reaching the stomach via the mouth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If anything reaches the stomach via the nose, this is like eating or drinking.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Snuff up \r\n    water deeply into the nose (when doing wudoo&rsquo;), except when you are fasting.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 788. If water reaching the stomach via the \r\n    nose did not invalidate the fast, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have told those who are fasting not to \r\n    snuff up water deeply into the nose.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fourth of the things that invalidate the fast is anything that is regarded as coming under \r\n    the same heading as eating and drinking&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This includes two things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Transfusion of blood to one who is fasting &ndash; such as if he bleeds heavily and is given a blood \r\n    transfusion.

Is he like the one who drinks after &lsquo;Asr or can he still \r\n    fast? Some people say that Fajr is not like a lamp which shines instantly \r\n    and the matter is broad in scope. What is the ruling?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: If the muezzin gives the call to prayer when the \r\n    dawn has come, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktoom gives the call to prayer, because \r\n    he does not give the call to prayer until dawn breaks.&rdquo; So if the muezzin \r\n    says: I have seen the dawn and I do not give the call to prayer until I see \r\n    the dawn, then it is obligatory for one to stop eating and drinking from the \r\n    moment he hears the adhaan, except in the case in which a concession is \r\n    allowed, which is if the vessel is in his hand, in which case he may drink \r\n    what he needs of it.

If the patient takes a deep breath in when \r\n    applying pressure to the puffer, this mist enters the airway (trachea), but \r\n    some of it remains in the pharynx, and a very small amount of it may enter \r\n    the oesophagus. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some contemporary scholars are of the view that using a \r\n    puffer invalidates the fast. They said: Because the contents of the puffer \r\n    may reach the stomach via the mouth, so it breaks the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But most contemporary scholars are of the view that using \r\n    this puffer does not break the fast, and this view is the correct one. They \r\n    quoted a number of things as evidence for this:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that the fast remains valid, and this \r\n    fact cannot be altered except when there is certain proof. Whether part of \r\n    the mist from the puffer reaches the stomach is something uncertain: it may \r\n    enter the stomach or it may not, because the basic principle is that this \r\n    substance goes to the respiratory system, but some of it may enter the \r\n    stomach. With this uncertainty we cannot say that it invalidates the fast. \r\n    This is the answer to the evidence for the first opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Assuming that some of this medicine does actually enter the \r\n    stomach, it is forgiven, and does not invalidate the fast, by analogy with \r\n    rinsing the mouth and using the miswaak.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to rinsing the mouth: when the fasting person \r\n    rinses his mouth, some of that water remains in his mouth, and some of that \r\n    water may go down to the stomach. Hence if he rinses his mouth with water in \r\n    which there is a radioactive substance, that radioactive substance will \r\n    appear in his stomach after a while, which confirms that some of the water \r\n    used for rinsing the mouth does go down into the stomach. But this part that \r\n    goes down into the stomach is a very small amount, which is overlooked in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. The ruling is that the fast is still valid if one rinses the \r\n    mouth. The amount of medicine from a puffer that reaches the stomach &ndash; if \r\n    any &ndash; is smaller than the amount of water that reaches the stomach when one \r\n    rinses the mouth, so it is more likely that it does not break the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the siwaak, it contains a substance that dissolves in \r\n    the saliva and goes down into the pharynx, and then to the stomach. But \r\n    Islam overlooks this, and does not regard it as invalidating the fast, \r\n    because it is a small amount and is not intentional. Similarly the part that \r\n    may go down into the stomach from the puffer is small, and the patient does \r\n    not intend for it to enter the stomach, so it does not break the fast, by \r\n    analogy with the miswaak.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus the strength of the second view is apparent.

The view of the \r\n    Shaafa&lsquo;is and Hanbalis is that in the case of one who is forced to break the \r\n    fast by having intercourse, eating or drinking, if the one who is forced \r\n    does that, it does not break the fast and he does not have to make it up, \r\n    unless the compulsion to break the fast was by means of zina, according to \r\n    the Shaafa&lsquo;is.

And \r\n    because in the case of compulsion there is no choice, and it is worse than \r\n    forgetting, and the one who forgets does not break his fast according to the \r\n    correct view, then being forced to break the fast is less serious than being \r\n    forced to utter words of kufr, and the one who utters words of kufr under \r\n    compulsion does not become a kaafir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If \r\n    a person is forced to do anything that breaks the fast and does it, there is \r\n    no sin on him and his fast is still valid, because Allah, may He be exalted, \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And there is no sin on you if you \r\n    make a mistake therein, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately \r\n    intend.

If this man who had intercourse with \r\n    his wife during the day in Ramadan was unaware of the ruling and thought \r\n    that the intercourse that is forbidden is that in which ejaculation occurs, \r\n    then there are no consequences for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he was aware that intercourse (during the day in \r\n    Ramadan) is haraam, but he did not know that expiation is required for it, \r\n    then he has to offer expiation, because there is a difference between \r\n    ignorance of the ruling and ignorance of the consequences.

They did this in \r\n    several ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i) The method of al-Bukhaari&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He is tormented because of that, if that was his habit and \r\n    his way and he approved of his family doing that during his lifetime, so he \r\n    will be tormented for that. If that was not his way then he will not be \r\n    tormented. Al-Bukhaari said: &ldquo;Chapter: The words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &lsquo;The deceased is tormented because of \r\n    his family&rsquo;s crying for him&rsquo; if wailing was his habit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, the meaning is that the one who is tormented \r\n    because of some of his family&rsquo;s crying for him is the one who approved of \r\n    that and it was his habit, etc. Hence the compiler said: &ldquo;If it was not his \r\n    way&rdquo; i.e., such as one who does not know that they do any of that, or he did \r\n    what was required of him by telling them not to do that. Such a person is \r\n    not to be blamed because of the actions of others. Hence Ibn al-Mubaarak \r\n    said: If he used to tell them not to do that during his lifetime, then they \r\n    do any of those things after he dies, there will be no blame on him. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii) <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Al-Nawawi attributed it to the majority and regarded it as \r\n    the correct interpretation. They interpreted the hadeeth as referring to one \r\n    who requested that people weep and wail for him after his death, and his \r\n    request was carried out. This person will be tormented because of his \r\n    family&rsquo;s crying and wailing for him, because he is the cause of it and it is \r\n    attributable to him. But if a person&rsquo;s family weep and wail for him without \r\n    him having asked them to do that, he will not be tormented, because Allaah \r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;and no bearer of burdens shall \r\n    bear the burden of another&rdquo; [al-An&rsquo;aam 6:164]<\/i>. They said: It was the \r\n    custom of the Arabs to request that that be done, as in the lines of poetry \r\n    composed by Tarafah ibn al-&lsquo;Abd:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;When I die, lament me as I deserve and rend your garment for \r\n    me, O daughter of Ma&rsquo;bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: So the hadeeth is to be understood in terms of \r\n    what was customary for them.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is to be understood as referring to one who requests that \r\n    people weep and wail for him, or who does not leave instructions that these \r\n    things should not be done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who leaves instructions that this should not be done \r\n    will not be tormented because of it, because he has nothing to do with it \r\n    and he was not negligent. The point here is that he should leave \r\n    instructions that these things not be done, and whoever neglects that will \r\n    be tormented because of it. This is the view of Dawood and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iv)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A number of scholars said that what is meant by the ahaadeeth \r\n    is that they used to wail for the deceased and lament him by listing his \r\n    so-called good qualities, which in fact were bad qualities according to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, for which he would be tormented.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So what is meant by &ldquo;he is tormented because of his family&rsquo;s \r\n    crying for him&rdquo; is that his torment is commensurate with his family&rsquo;s \r\n    lamentation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view was favoured by Ibn Hazm and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They used to lament the dead for his leadership by means of \r\n    which he oppressed others, for his courage which he used in ways other than \r\n    obedience to Allaah, his generosity which was not in support of the truth; \r\n    so his family weep for him and list these traits, when he is being tormented \r\n    because of them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (v)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by torment is the rebuke of the angels for the \r\n    things for which his family eulogize him, as narrated by Ibn Maajah (1594) \r\n    from Aseed ibn Abi Aseed from Moosa ibn Abi Moosa al-&lsquo;Ashari from his \r\n    father, that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The deceased is tormented for the crying of the living. If they say, \r\n    &lsquo;O my strength, O he who clothed us, O my help, O my rock,&rsquo; and so on, he is \r\n    rebuked and it is said, &lsquo;Were you really like that? Were you really like \r\n    that?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Aseed said: I said, Subhaan-Allaah, Allaah says, <i>&ldquo;And no \r\n    bearer of burdens shall bear another&rsquo;s burden&rdquo; [Faatir 35:18]<\/i>. He said, \r\n    Woe to you, I tell you that Abu Moosa narrated to me from the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah (S), and you think that Abu Moosa was telling lies about the Prophet \r\n    (S)? Or do you think that I am telling lies about Abu Moosa?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Ibn Maajah<\/i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another version was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1003): &ldquo;There is \r\n    no one who dies and his mourner laments him, saying, &lsquo;O my rock, O my \r\n    master&rsquo; and so on, but two angels are appointed to shove him, saying, &lsquo;Were \r\n    you really like that?&rsquo;&rdquo; Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is supported by the report narrated by al-Bukhaari \r\n    (4268) from al-Nu&rsquo;maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) who \r\n    said: &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Rawaahah fell unconscious, and his sister &lsquo;Amrah \r\n    started to weep, saying, &ldquo;O our rock&rdquo; and so on, enumerating his good \r\n    traits. When he regained consciousness, he said: &ldquo;You did not say anything \r\n    but it was said to me: &lsquo;Are you really like that?&rsquo;&rdquo; When he died, she did \r\n    not cry for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (vi)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;That what is meant by torment is the pain that the deceased \r\n    feels because of the wailing etc that his family does. This is the view \r\n    favoured by Abu Ja&rsquo;far al-Tabari among the earlier scholars; it was also \r\n    regarded as more correct by al-Qaadi &lsquo;Iyaad, and was supported by Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and a number of later scholars. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They quoted as evidence for that the hadeeth of Qaylah bint \r\n    Makhramah, which says that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) forbade her to cry for her son and said: &ldquo;If you are kind to \r\n    your little companion in this world, why can&rsquo;t you say <i>Inna Lillaahi wa \r\n    inna ilayhi raaji&rsquo;oon<\/i> [Verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our \r\n    return] when he dies? By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, when \r\n    one of you cries that causes his little companion to shed tears. O slaves of \r\n    Allaah, do not torment your dead.&rdquo; Al-Haafiz said: its isnaad is hasan. \r\n    Al-Haythami said: its men are thiqaat (trustworthy).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This last view is the most correct of what has been said \r\n    concerning the meaning of the hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; \r\n    al-Fataawa<\/i> (34\/364): Is the deceased harmed by his family&rsquo;s crying for \r\n    him?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is a difference of opinion concerning this issue among \r\n    the earlier and later generations and the scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that he is harmed by their crying, as is \r\n    stated in the saheeh ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; then he quoted some of these ahaadeeth, then he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This was denied by some of the earlier and later generations, \r\n    because they thought that this meant that a person was being punished for \r\n    the sin of another, which is contrary to the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;and no bearer of burdens shall bear the \r\n    burden of another&rdquo; [al-An&rsquo;aam 6:164]<\/i>. Then they varied in how they \r\n    commented on those saheeh ahaadeeth. Some said that the narrators, such as \r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab and others, had made a mistake; this was the method of \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and others. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some interpreted that as referring to cases where the \r\n    deceased had instructed that that be done, so he is punished for his \r\n    instructions. This was the view of a number of people such as al-Mazani and \r\n    others. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some interpreted it as referring to cases where that is the \r\n    custom, so he is punished for not forbidding an evil action. This is the \r\n    view of a number of people such as my [i.e., Ibn Taymiyah&rsquo;s] grandfather \r\n    Abu&rsquo;l-Barakaat.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    All of these views are very weak. The clear, saheeh ahaadeeth \r\n    that were narrated by people such as &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab, his son \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah, Abu Moosa al-Ash&rsquo;ari and others cannot be refuted by such \r\n    arguments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of those who accept this hadeeth as it is think that \r\n    this comes under the heading of punishing a man for the sins of another, and \r\n    that Allaah does as He wills and rules as He wants, so they believe that \r\n    Allaah punishes a man for the sin of another. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But Allaah will not punish anyone in the Hereafter except for \r\n    his own sin: <i>&ldquo;and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another&rdquo; \r\n    [al-An&rsquo;aam 6:164].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the deceased being tormented because of his family&rsquo;s \r\n    crying for him, the word used in Arabic is <i>yu&rsquo;adhdhab<\/i>, not <i>\r\n    yu&rsquo;aaqab<\/i>. &lsquo;<i>Adhaab<\/i> is more general in meaning than &lsquo;<i>iqaab<\/i>; \r\n    it refers to pain and not everyone who suffers pain for some reason is being \r\n    punished for that reason. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Travel is a kind of torment (&lsquo;<i>adhaab<\/i>); it keeps one \r\n    of you from his food and drink.&rdquo; So he called travel a torment (&lsquo;<i>adhaab<\/i>), \r\n    but it is not a punishment for any sin. A man may be tormented by unpleasant \r\n    things that he senses, such as alarming noises, bad smells and nasty images, \r\n    so he is tormented by hearing them, smelling them or seeing them, but this \r\n    does not mean that he is being punished for some deed. How can we deny that \r\n    the deceased may be tormented by his family&rsquo;s wailing, even though the \r\n    wailing is not a deed of his for which he is to be punished?<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We cannot decide that every person for whom his family wails \r\n    is being tormented because of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Wailing is a cause of torment, but that may be warded off by \r\n    the status of the deceased.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This torment which may befall the believer because of his \r\n    family&rsquo;s wailing for him, is among the hardships by means of which Allaah \r\n    will expiate the believer&rsquo;s sins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of the kaafir, his torment will be increased \r\n    thereby, so the pain of the punishment is exacerbated by the pain that \r\n    results from his family&rsquo;s crying for him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then Shaykh al-Islam said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The pains or torment that befall the Muslim in this world, in \r\n    al-barzakh and on the Day of Resurrection are a means by which Allaah will \r\n    expiate his sins, as it is narrated in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;<span>&quot;<\/span>No \r\n    fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress \r\n    befalls a Muslim<span> &nbsp;<\/span>even if it were the prick he \r\n    receives from a thorn, but<span> <\/span>Allaah expiates some of \r\n    his sins for that.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: What is the meaning of the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The believer is tormented because of his \r\n    family&rsquo;s crying for him&rdquo;?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What it means is that if his family cries for him, he will \r\n    know of that and will feel pain. It does not mean that Allaah will punish \r\n    him for that because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;and no \r\n    bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another&rdquo; [al-An&rsquo;aam 6:164]<\/i>. \r\n    Torment is not necessarily a punishment. Have you not heard the words of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Travel is a kind \r\n    of torment&rdquo;? Travel is not a kind of punishment, but a person suffers \r\n    torment and exhaustion during it. Similarly, when the deceased person&rsquo;s \r\n    family weeps for him, he suffers pain and is upset by that, even though that \r\n    is not a punishment from Allaah. This interpretation of the hadeeth is quite \r\n    clear and does not cause any confusion. There is no need to say that this \r\n    has to do with one who left instructions that they wail for him, or one \r\n    whose family&rsquo;s custom was to wail but he did not tell them not to do that. \r\n    Rather we say that a person may be tormented by something but it doesn&rsquo;t \r\n    harm him.

This was stated clearly by al-Muhibb al-Tabari and \r\n    others. It seems to me that the qiraat may also be earned by those who only \r\n    offer the funeral prayer, because everything that happens before the prayer \r\n    is a means that leads to it. But the qiraat of the one who prays only is \r\n    less than the qiraat of the one who walks with the funeral procession and \r\n    offers the prayer. The report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah says, \r\n    &ldquo;The least of them is like Uhud,&rdquo; which indicates that the qiraats may \r\n    vary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 3\/234&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to one who follows a funeral procession but does \r\n    not offer the prayer or attend the burial, he is not included in this \r\n    promise, but there is the hope that he will attain some reward for his \r\n    intention.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    al-Zayn ibn al-Munayyir said: the qiraat is earned only by the one who \r\n    follows the funeral procession and offers the prayer, or follows the funeral \r\n    procession and attends the burial, not by one who follows it then leaves \r\n    without praying. That is because following the funeral procession is a means \r\n    that leads to one of two things, either the prayer or the burial. If a \r\n    person takes the means without achieving the ends, then he will not attain \r\n    the consequences of achieving the ends, although there is the hope that the \r\n    one who does that will be rewarded according to his intention.

Al-Bukhaari (47) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever attends the funeral of a Muslim out of faith and \r\n    in the hope of reward, and stays with him until the funeral prayer has been \r\n    offered for him and the burial is finished, comes back with two qiraats of \r\n    reward.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What this implies is that the two qiraats are only attained \r\n    by the one who stays (with the funeral procession) all the way, until the \r\n    deceased is buried. If he prays then goes to the grave by himself and \r\n    attends the burial, he will only earn one qiraat. End quote from <i>Fath \r\n    al-Baari<\/i>, 3\/234.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>Sharh<\/i> <i>Kitaab al-Janaa&rsquo;iz min Buloogh al-Maraam<\/i>: One of the \r\n    things that we learn from the hadeeth (i.e., the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah \r\n    quoted at the beginning of this answer) is that the two qiraats are earned \r\n    only by the one who attends the prayer and the burial, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever attends [the \r\n    funeral] until the burial.&rdquo; It is well known that the prayer comes before \r\n    the burial.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person attends the burial without attending the prayer, \r\n    such as if a man passes by some people in the graveyard who are burying a \r\n    deceased person, and he joins them and helps them with the burial, there is \r\n    nothing in the hadeeth to indicate that a person who attends the burial only \r\n    will earn the qiraat. Rather he will only earn a qiraat by attending the \r\n    burial if he also attended the prayer. It is not necessarily the case that a \r\n    person who earns a reward by doing one thing in conjunction with another \r\n    will earn it by doing it on its own.

The fact that he (the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) commanded others to offer \r\n    the prayer for him indicates that they come under the heading of believers \r\n    and are not regarded as non-believers because of the sins they committed. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person who did not pay \r\n    zakaah and did not pray except in Ramadaan dies, the people of knowledge and \r\n    religious commitment should refrain from offering the funeral prayer for him \r\n    as a punishment and a rebuke to those who are like him, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) refrained from offering the \r\n    funeral prayer for one who had killed himself, one who had stolen from the \r\n    war booty, and a debtor who had died without paying off his debt.

If a person offers the funeral prayer \r\n    for him in the hope that Allaah will have mercy on him, and because there is \r\n    no purpose to be served by refraining from offering the prayer for him, he \r\n    has also done well.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi<\/i> it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The apparent meaning is that what Hudhayfah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) meant in this hadeeth was death announcements (al-na&rsquo;i) in \r\n    the linguistic sense, and he understood the prohibition as applying to all \r\n    kinds of na&rsquo;i. Other scholars said that what is meant by na&rsquo;i in this \r\n    hadeeth is the kind of death announcement that was known during the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah. Al-Asma&rsquo;i said: If someone of status died among the Arabs, a \r\n    rider would mount his horse and go among the people saying, &ldquo;I announce the \r\n    death of So and so,&rdquo; telling the news of his death. They said that because \r\n    [?] it is proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) announced the death of the Negus, and that he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) announced the deaths of Zayd ibn Haarithah, \r\n    Ja&rsquo;far ibn Abi Taalib and &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Rawaahah when they were killed at \r\n    Mu&rsquo;tah.

Hence the scholars said that \r\n    what is meant by na&rsquo;i in the phrase, &ldquo;he forbade al-na&rsquo;i&rdquo; is the kind of \r\n    death announcement that was known during the Jaahiliyyah. In this way the \r\n    ahaadeeth may be reconciled.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi said: From the ahaadeeth it may be understood \r\n    that there are three types of death announcements. The first is informing \r\n    the family, friends and righteous people; this is Sunnah. The second is \r\n    calling people to attend a gathering to show how important the deceased was; \r\n    this is makrooh. The third is announcing it in some other manner, such as \r\n    wailing and the like; this is haraam.

This was done by &lsquo;Ali and Anas, may Allaah be pleased\r\n    with them, and by Sulaymaan ibn Rabee&rsquo;ah, Abu Hamzah and Mu&rsquo;ammar ibn Sameer.\r\n    The prayer may be offered at the graveside, and it may be repeated before the burial\r\n    either in congregation or individually. This was stated by Ahmad, who said: &ldquo;There is\r\n    nothing wrong with that. It was done by a number of the Companions of the Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&rdquo; (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>,\r\n    2\/512)<\/p>\r\n    <p>In a hadeeth, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: &ldquo;The\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached a new grave, and they formed\r\n    a row behind him, and he recited <i>Takbeer<\/i> (said &ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo;) four\r\n    times.&rdquo; (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 1319, Muslim, 1586).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Sheeraazi said: &ldquo;If someone comes who\r\n    has not yet offered the (funeral) prayer for him, he should do so.&rdquo; (<i>al-Muhadhdhab<\/i>\r\n    , 1\/134).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Both the prayers are valid, because the prayer\r\n    for the deceased may be offered more than once for a valid reason. Some of the scholars\r\n    mentioned that it is permissible for a person who missed the funeral prayer to offer the\r\n    prayer over him in his grave, up to a period of one month following his death. So those\r\n    who offered the prayer for him in Pakistan did so because they had not prayed for him\r\n    before that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We must also point out that the Sunnah is to bury the\r\n    deceased where he died, except in cases of necessity.

It was narrated that \r\n          the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n          of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. Women should stop \r\n          visiting graves. The woman who visited a grave out of ignorance (of \r\n          this ruling) is not to blame, but she should not do it again. If she \r\n          does so, she has to repent and seek forgiveness, and repentance cancels \r\n          out whatever came before. Visiting graves is only for men. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) said: &ldquo;Visit graves, for they will remind you of the Hereafter.&rdquo; \r\n          At the beginning of Islam, visiting graves was not allowed for men and \r\n          women alike, because the Muslims were new in Islam and came from a background \r\n          where grave-worship and attachment to the dead were widespread. So they \r\n          were forbidden to visit graves as a preventative measure, to avoid evil \r\n          and prevent <i><span>shirk<\/span><\/i>. But once Islam was well-established and they understood \r\n          Islam, Allaah prescribed visiting the graves because of the lessons \r\n          and reminders of death and the Hereafter involved in that, and so that \r\n          they could make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for the deceased and pray for mercy for them. \r\n          Then Allaah forbade woman to do that &ndash; according to the most correct \r\n          of the two scholarly opinions &ndash; because they may present a temptation \r\n          to men and even to themselves, and because they have little patience \r\n          and they get too upset. So by His mercy and kindness towards them, Allaah \r\n          forbade them to visit graves. This is also a form of kindness towards \r\n          the men, because if they were all to gather at the grave, this might \r\n          cause fitnah.

There is nothing wrong with this travelling because \r\n          it is travelling for a legitimate purpose, even though this action was \r\n          not known among Muslims in the past. It was not done in the past because \r\n          they were not able to do that, unlike today when travelling has become \r\n          easier with faster methods of transportation. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;With regard to offering the funeral \r\n          prayer for the deceased in absentia, there is a great deal of difference \r\n          of opinion among the scholars on this matter, because it is not reported \r\n          that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n          of Allaah be upon him) did that, except in the case of the Negus (ruler \r\n          of Abyssinia), and it was not narrated that the Muslims outside of Madeenah \r\n          prayed for the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) in absentia when he died, even though \r\n          their love for him was so great. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;Also, it is not reported that the Muslims \r\n          prayed in absentia for any of the khulafaa&rsquo; al-raashideen (the rightly-guided \r\n          khaleefahs, the first four leaders of Islam after the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) when they died. Prayer \r\n          for the dead in absentia was not known among the Muslims even though \r\n          circumstances might have dictated it, such as the eagerness of the Muslims \r\n          to do something of benefit for their brothers, especially those who \r\n          were held in high esteem by all the Muslims, or one to whom one is related \r\n          or who one is fond of, which would make one seek to do something good \r\n          for him by praying for him. For this reason, scholars such as Shaykh \r\n          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah were of the view that the fact that the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) prayed for the Negus was an exceptional case which applied \r\n          only to him, because there was no one in the land where he died who \r\n          could offer the janaazah prayer for him. In my view, this is a sound \r\n          view in the light of the above. Some scholars say that the funeral prayer \r\n          in absentia may be offered only for certain people among the ummah, \r\n          such as famous scholars and just rulers; this view is close to the previous \r\n          view. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;On this basis, there is no reason why \r\n          the funeral prayer should not be offered for the deceased both when \r\n          one is present and in absentia. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;Secondly: <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Gathering to read Qur&rsquo;aan and give the reward for that \r\n          to the deceased is a bid&rsquo;ah (reprehensible innovation), even if it is \r\n          not done in return for any payment. If it is done in return for payment \r\n          then it is haraam, because it is being done for a reason other than \r\n          for the sake of Allaah, and any such action will not earn any reward. \r\n          But if a person reads Qur&rsquo;aan by himself and gives the reward for that \r\n          to a relative or friend, without gathering with others for that purpose \r\n          and without seeking payment, then there are two scholarly views in this \r\n          case, one of which says that it is permissible and that the reward for \r\n          the reading will reach the deceased. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;The second view is that it is not prescribed \r\n          to give the reward for the reading to anyone, because there is no evidence \r\n          (daleel) to indicate that this is prescribed. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;Thirdly: <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>If the family of the deceased have a special reading, \r\n          and invite people to a meal three days and forty days after the death, \r\n          this is bid&rsquo;ah (reprehensible innovation). <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;And every bid&rsquo;ah is a going astray. \r\n          The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever invents something \r\n          in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not a part of it will have \r\n          it rejected.&rdquo; The action mentioned is a matter that has been invented \r\n          in the religion, so it is to be rejected, and the one who does it is \r\n          a sinner and will not be rewarded. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;What people say about the soul of the \r\n          deceased visiting the house after forty days to get the reward is a \r\n          lie which has no basis. The person who told you that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions did not \r\n          do any of these things was right.

The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Visit the\r\n    graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter.&quot; <em>(Narrated by Muslim, 976).<\/em><br>\r\n    The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves, as did his\r\n    Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them.<br>\r\n    It was reported that 'Aa'ishah said that when it was her night for the Messenger of Allaah\r\n<img>\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to stay with her, he would go out during the\r\n    latter part of the night to (the cemetery of) al-Baqee' and say, &quot;Peace be upon you,\r\n    dwellings of the believing people. There has come to you that which you were promised,\r\n    &#133;, and if Allaah wills we will follow you soon. O Allaah, forgive the people of\r\n    Baqee' al-Gharqad.&quot; <em>(Narrated by Muslim, 974).<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    (ii) the second type is bid'ah (innovation), which is visiting graves for the purpose of\r\n    calling upon their occupants, seeking their help, offering sacrifices to them and making\r\n    vows to them. This is forbidden and is a major form of <em>Shirk (shirk akbar)<\/em>.\r\n    Connected to this is the practice of visiting graves to offer du'aa', perform salaah and\r\n    read Qur'aan there. This is all bid'ah and is not prescribed in Islam.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    2. With regard to praying (performing salaah) at a grave. If what is meant is <em>Salaat\r\n    al-janaazah<\/em> (the funeral prayer), this is permissible and is not forbidden. But if\r\n    what is meant is to perform fard or naafil prayers, this is forbidden and is haraam.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The evidence for the permissibility of praying Salaat al-Janaazah in the graveyard:<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that a black man or a black woman who used to clean the\r\n    mosque died. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked about him and\r\n    they said, &quot;He died.&quot; He said, &quot;Why did you not tell me? Show me his\r\n    grave.&quot; Or he said, &quot;her grave.&quot; So he went to the grave and prayed for\r\n    her. <em>(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 446; Muslim, 956).<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The evidence that it is not permissible to offer any salaat other than janaazah in the\r\n    graveyard:<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    (a) 'Aa'ishah and 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Abbaas said: &quot;When (death) approached the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he started to cover his\r\n    face with a cloak of his. When he became distressed he lifted it from his face and said,\r\n    &quot;May Allaah curse the Jews and the Christians, for they have taken the graves of\r\n    their Prophets as places of worship.&quot; [The narrator said:] he was warning against\r\n    doing what they did.&quot; <em>(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 425; Muslim, 531).<\/em><br>\r\n    (b) Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi said: the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) said: &quot;Do not sit on graves and do not pray facing them.&quot; <em>(Narrated\r\n    by Muslim, 972).<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    3. With regard to the 'Urs which is held every year: if this involves some kinds of acts\r\n    of worship, or if the people who attend think that this will bring them closer to Allaah,\r\n    or if it involves acts of disobedience and sin, then it is not permissible to attend it or\r\n    take part in it. Even if it is free of all these matters, you should still not attend it,\r\n    because adopting an occasion as an &quot;Eid&quot; or festival (a regular annual event)\r\n    other than the Eids precribed in Islam is bid'ah (reprehensible innovation) and is\r\n    forbidden. The belief of those present, that the soul of the &quot;wali&quot; attends this\r\n    'Urs is an innovated and forbidden belief, because in the future this may be taken as\r\n    being a part of the religion, and it will lead people astray. So this event must be\r\n    denounced and people must be warned against it, and you should not attend it. And Allaah\r\n    is the guide to the straight path.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    4. With regard to asking a righteous person to make du'aa' for you when he is still alive\r\n    - this is permissible, because there is the hope that his du'aa' may be answered because\r\n    of his righteousness. The evidence for this is:<br>\r\n    (a) It was reported from 'Uthmaan ibn Haneef (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a blind\r\n    man came to the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &quot;Pray\r\n    to Allaah to heal me.&quot; He said, &quot;If you wish, I will pray for you, and if you\r\n    wish, I will delay that, and that will be better.&quot; (According to another report:\r\n    &quot;If you wish, be patient - that will be better for you.&quot;) He said, &quot;Pray\r\n    for me.&quot; So he commanded him to do wudoo' and to do it well, and to pray two\r\n    rak'ahs&#133;&quot;<br>\r\n    <em>(Narrated by Ahmad, 4\/138; al-Tirmidhi, 5\/569; Ibn Maajah, 1\/441; it is a saheeh\r\n    hadeeth).<\/em><br>\r\n    (b) It was reported that Anas said: whilst the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) was giving the khutbah (sermon) on Friday, a man stood up and said, &quot;O\r\n    Messenger of Allaah, the horses have died and the sheep have died. Pray to Allaah to give\r\n    us rain.&quot; So he spread his hands and prayed (made du'aa'). <em>(Narrated by\r\n    al-Bukhaari, 890; Muslim, 897).<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    5. If a wali or Prophet dies, it is not correct, according to sharee'ah, to ask him to\r\n    make du'aa' for you, because he has been cut off from this world. This is a kind of <em>shirk<\/em>\r\n    which is not committed by any of the righteous people of this Ummah, the Sahaabah and\r\n    those who follow them.<br>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>\r\n    <em>&quot;And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides All&acirc;h, such as\r\n    will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their\r\n    calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection),\r\n    they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping&quot; <br>\r\n    [al-Ahqaaf 46:5-6]<br>\r\n    <\/em>Shaykh Al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah - may Allaah have mercy on him) said: To explain\r\n    further: if what the person wants is something that none is able to do except Allaah -\r\n    such as asking for healing from sickness, for people or animals, or for his debts to be\r\n    paid off in some manner that he does not specify, or for his family to be safe and sound,\r\n    or to be protected from calamity in this world or the next, or for help against his enemy,\r\n    or for his heart to be guided, or for his sins to be forgiven, or for him to be admitted\r\n    to Paradise or saved from Hell, or for help to learn knowledge and the Qur'aan, or for his\r\n    heart to be reformed, his attitude to be made good, his soul to be purified and so on -\r\n    all of these are things which it is not permissible to seek from anyone other than Allaah.\r\n    It is not permissible to say to an angel or a Prophet or a shaykh, whether he is alive or\r\n    dead, &quot;forgive my sin&quot; or &quot;help me against my enemy&quot; or &quot;heal my\r\n    sick loved one&quot; or &quot;protect my family or my livestock&quot; and the like.<br>\r\n    Whoever asks any created being - no matter who he is - for any of these things, is a\r\n    mushrik who associates others with his Lord. He is like the mushrikeen who worship angels,\r\n    Prophets and statues which they have created in their image, and his prayer is like the\r\n    prayers of the Christians to the Messiah and his mother. Allaah says (interpretation of\r\n    the meaning):<br>\r\n    <em>&quot;And (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): &quot;O 'Eesaa\r\n    (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods\r\n    besides Allaah?' &quot; He will say: &quot;Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what\r\n    I had no right (to say).&quot; [al-Maa'idah 5:116]<br>\r\n    &quot;They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords\r\n    besides Allaah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to\r\n    their own desires without being ordered by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord)\r\n    Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the\r\n    Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God - Allaah) Laa\r\n    ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him\r\n    (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).&quot; [al-Tawbah\r\n    9:31]<br>\r\n    (Majmoo' al-Fataawaa, 27\/ 67, 68).<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    And he [Ibn Taymiyah] said:<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Whoever comes to the grave of a Prophet or a righteous man, or what he believes to be the\r\n    grave of a Prophet or a righteous man although it is not, and asks him for something and\r\n    seeks his help, one of the three following scenarios applies:<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    (i) he is asking him for something that he needs, such as to cure his sick animals or to\r\n    pay off his debt or to take revenge on his enemy or to protect him, his family and his\r\n    livestock, and other things which no one can do except Allaah. This is obvious shirk and\r\n    he must be told to repent. If he repents, all well and good, otherwise he must be\r\n    executed.<br>\r\n    If he says, I am asking him because he is closer to Allaah, so that he can intercede for\r\n    me with regard to these matters, because I am seeking Allaah's help through his virtue,\r\n    just as people seek the ruler's help through those who are close to him - this is also\r\n    like the actions of the mushrikeen and Christians, who claim that they take their priests\r\n    and monks as intercessors and ask them to intercede for them with their requests. Allaah\r\n    tells us that the mushrikeen say:<br>\r\n    <em>&quot; 'We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah.'&quot; [al-Zumar\r\n    39:3 - interpretation of the meaning].<\/em><br>\r\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>\r\n    <em>&quot;Have they taken (others) as intercessors besides Allaah? Say: &quot;Even if they\r\n    have power over nothing whatever and have no intelligence?&quot; Say: &quot;To Allaah\r\n    belongs all intercession. His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him\r\n    you shall be brought back.&quot; [al-Zumar 39:43-44]<br>\r\n    &quot;You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Wali (protector or helper) or an\r\n    intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)?&quot; [al-Sajdah 32:4]<br>\r\n    &quot;Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?&quot; [al-Baqarah\r\n    2:255].<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The difference between Him and His creation is clear: people usually ask some of their\r\n    leading figures who are in positions of honour to intercede for them with their leaders,\r\n    so that intercessor asks the leader and he meets the person's request because he hopes to\r\n    gain something thereby, or because he is afraid of him, or because he is too shy to\r\n    refuse, or because he is being friendly towards him, etc. But no one intercedes with\r\n    Allaah, may He be glorified, until He gives permission to the intercessor. He only does\r\n    what He wills, and the intercession of the intercessor is only made by His permission. The\r\n    entire matter rests with Him&#133; The idea of many misguided people, that this person is\r\n    closer to Allaah than I am, and I am far away from Allaah and cannot call upon Him except\r\n    through this mediation etc., all of these ideas are ideas of shirk. Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):<br>\r\n    <em>&quot;And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad <img>\r\n ) concerning Me, then (answer them), I\r\n    am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant\r\n    when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor)&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:186]<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    In <em>al-Saheeh<\/em> it was reported that when they were on a journey, they were <em>saying\r\n    Takbeer (&quot;Allaahu akbar&quot;)<\/em> in loud voices, and the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:<br>\r\n    &quot;O people, take it easy! You are not calling upon One Who is deaf or absent; you are\r\n    calling upon One Who is All-Hearing and Ever Near. The One upon Whom you are calling is\r\n    closer to any one of you than the neck of his camel.&quot;<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Allaah has commanded all people to pray to Him and call on Him, and He has commanded them\r\n    all to say (interpretation of the meaning):<br>\r\n    <em>&quot;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and\r\n    everything).&quot; [al-Faatihah 1:5].<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    And He has told us that the Mushrikeen say:<br>\r\n    <em>&quot; 'We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah.'&quot; [al-Zumar\r\n    39:3 - interpretation of the meaning].<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Moreover, it may be said to this mushrik: if you call upon this person, that means you\r\n    think that he knows more about your situation, is more able to grant you what you ask for\r\n    and is more merciful towards you. This is ignorance, misguidance and kufr. If you know\r\n    that Allaah has more knowledge and is more able and more merciful, then why do you fail to\r\n    ask Him, and instead turn to others? Have you not heard what al-Bukhaari and others\r\n    narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to teach us to pray <em>Istikhaarah<\/em>\r\n    (du'aa' seeking guidance from Allaah) in all our affairs, just as he taught us the Surahs\r\n    of the Qur'aan.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Even if you know that this person is closer to Allaah than you and of a higher status than\r\n    you, this may be true, but what you are implying is wrong. Even if he is indeed closer to\r\n    Allaah and of a higher status, that only means that Allaah will reward him and give him\r\n    more than you. It does not mean that if you call on him, Allaah will answer your prayer\r\n    more than He would do if you called upon Him yourself. If you are deserving of being\r\n    punished and of having your supplication rejected, for example, because your du'aa' is\r\n    offered in an improper manner, then no Prophet or righteous person will help you to do\r\n    something that Allaah dislikes and is angry with. Even if that is not the case, then you\r\n    should ask from Allaah because Allaah is more merciful.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <em>(Majmoo' al-Fataawaa, 27\/72-75<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    We advise our brother to learn more about this matter by referring to the books mentioned\r\n    above.<\/em><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    And Allaah knows best. <br>\r\n    <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10756","question_id":"10756","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<o>\r\n    <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>We put this question to Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn\r\n      Jibreen, who replied:<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>If when he died he was persisting in calling on the\r\n      dead for help, it is not permissible to follow his funeral procession.

The sanctity of the dead is like the sanctity of the living. So it\r\n      is not permissible to subject graves to any disrespect, whether by\r\n      stepping on them, making them pathways, praying in the graveyard, or\r\n      making them part of people&rsquo;s dwelling-places. None of these things are\r\n      allowed, unless the occupants of the graves have turned to dust and there\r\n      is nothing left of their bodies. In that case, it is OK to use the\r\n      graveyards for fields or houses or other purposes. But so long as any\r\n      trace of the dead bodies are left, it is not permissible to use them or\r\n      walk on them, because the dead Muslim came to this place before you; he\r\n      got there first so he has more right to it. His sanctity when he is dead\r\n      is the same as his sanctity when he was alive. When the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a man step on a grave, he\r\n      said: &ldquo;If one of you were to sit on a live coal that burned his garment\r\n      and reached his skin, that would be better for him than sitting on a\r\n      grave.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 9711; Abu Dawood, 3228). This is a warning,\r\n      because of the disrespect towards that Muslim that is involved. The\r\n      scholars stated that it is haraam to relieve oneself in between graves,\r\n      and that it is not permitted to sit on a grave, because the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not sit on graves,\r\n      and do not pray towards them.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, no. 972; Abu Dawood,\r\n      no. 3229).

Supplication (du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;), praying for forgiveness for your \r\n    father, asking for mercy for him and giving charity on his behalf are all \r\n    acts that will benefit the deceased, whether he is a father or anyone else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the Mushaf that the deceased left behind, it \r\n    will benefit him if he left it as a waqf (endowment), as the reward for it \r\n    will benefit him.

Another example is if he left some \r\n    land or a house or a shop as a waqf, for charity to be given to the poor or \r\n    donated to the mosque by its income. For all of these things he would be \r\n    rewarded. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said \r\n    according to the saheeh hadeeth: &ldquo;When a man dies, all his good deeds come \r\n    to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, and a \r\n    righteous son who will pray for him.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ongoing charity will benefit the deceased if he was a Muslim, \r\n    and he will also be benefited by the supplication of his children and \r\n    others, and by the waqf that he set up for charitable purposes such as a \r\n    house, land, a shop, date palms and so on. He will benefit from this waqf if \r\n    people benefit from it, if they eat from its income and benefit from its \r\n    income, or its income is spent on maintaining and furnishing mosques for the \r\n    Muslims.

There is \r\n    also nothing to prevent them offering the funeral prayer for the deceased in \r\n    the mosque or prayer-place, as the women offered the funeral prayer at the \r\n    time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and at the \r\n    time of his Companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to wailing and listening, the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade wailing and said: &ldquo;There are four \r\n    matters of jaahiliyyah that exist among my ummah and they will not give them \r\n    up: boasting about one&rsquo;s forefathers, casting aspersions upon people&rsquo;s \r\n    lineages, seeking rain by the stars and wailing for the dead.&rdquo; And he said: \r\n    &ldquo;If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, she will be raised \r\n    on the Day of Resurrection wearing pants of tar and a chemise of scabs.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    explained that wailing for the dead is a blameworthy act of jaahiliyyah and \r\n    it must not be done. Umm &lsquo;Atiyyah said: The Messenger (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) took a pledge from us when we swore allegiance, that \r\n    we would not wail.

There is some weakness in its \r\n    isnaad, but there is corroborating evidence for its meaning, so wailing is \r\n    haraam and reprehensible, and it is not permissible for a woman to be \r\n    involved in wailing, or for a man to do that either.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Wailing refers to raising the voice when weeping and saying, \r\n    &ldquo;O my support, O one who clothed me, O how sad I am&rdquo; and so on. The one who \r\n    listens is the woman who listens to the ones who are wailing and encourages \r\n    them, so she sits with them and encourages them to wail. This is included \r\n    because sitting with them is a kind of encouragement. So it is not \r\n    permissible to listen to them. If the one who is wailing will not be quiet, \r\n    it is obligatory to leave her and not sit with her, by way of shunning her \r\n    and denouncing her. If a woman sits with her and listens to her, this is a \r\n    kind of help and encouragement.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it is not permissible to listen to one who is wailing; \r\n    rather she should denounce her and tell her not to do that.

So in \r\n    fact he has attained two rewards: the reward for protecting his Muslim \r\n    brothers and the reward of martyrdom for being burned to death. But you \r\n    should note that we do not testify for any particular individual, meaning \r\n    for example, that if a person is burned to death in front of us, we say &ldquo;the \r\n    one who is burned to death is a martyr,&rdquo; but we do not say &ldquo;this man is a \r\n    martyr.&rdquo; Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) referred to this issue in \r\n    his <i>Saheeh<\/i> and said: &ldquo;Chapter: It cannot be said that So and so is a \r\n    martyr.&rdquo; Then he quoted as evidence for that the words of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): &ldquo; &hellip; wounded for the sake of \r\n    Allah; Allah knows best who is wounded for His sake.&rdquo; He said: Allah knows \r\n    best; therefore if Allah knows who is wounded for His sake, then we cannot \r\n    testify for anyone; rather we say in general terms that the one who is \r\n    killed for the sake of Allah is a martyr.

It makes no difference whether the \r\n    bank is in need or not. Every loan that brings benefit is riba according to \r\n    scholarly consensus. What a loan means is taking money and paying it back; \r\n    if there is an agreement that it will be returned with something extra, even \r\n    if it is one dirham, this is undoubtedly riba.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>There is nothing in the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah to suggest that riba is only that which is taken from the \r\n    needy, sick or desperate.

There is also the riba of sales, such as exchanging \r\n    gold for gold with an additional amount, or silver for silver with an \r\n    additional amount, or date or dates with an additional amount. The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There are seventy-two \r\n    types of riba, the least of which is equivalent to a man committing incest \r\n    with his mother.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tabaraani in <i>al-Awsat<\/i>; classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, no. 3537.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace to Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;A dirham of riba that a man consumed \r\n    knowingly is worse before Allaah then thirty-six acts of zina.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    Ahmad and al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh \r\n    al-Jaami<\/i>, no. 3375.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This stern warning shakes the \r\n    heart of every believing man and woman, and prevents him or her from falling \r\n    into this grave sin.

This includes everything \r\n    that is eaten up or consumed unjustly in transactions and donations, and \r\n    whatever is taken without consent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eating up or consuming wealth unjustly in transactions is of \r\n    two types, which Allah mentioned in His Book. They are usury (riba) and \r\n    gambling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The prohibition on usury, which is the opposite of charity, \r\n    is mentioned at the end of Soorat al-Baqarah, Soorat Aal &lsquo;Imraan and \r\n    ar-Room.

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    forbade ambiguous transactions, as was narrated by Muslim and others from \r\n    Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). Ambiguous transactions are \r\n    those of which the outcome is unknown, which leads to the same negative \r\n    outcomes as gambling, namely enmity and resentment, in addition to consuming \r\n    wealth unlawfully, which is a type of oppression or wrongdoing. Ambiguous \r\n    transactions involve wrongdoing, enmity and resentment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for usury, the prohibition on it in the Qur&rsquo;an is more \r\n    emphatic.

Allah stated that some \r\n    good things that had been permitted to the Jews became forbidden to them \r\n    because of their wrongdoing, their preventing people from following the path \r\n    of Allah, and their consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully. And He, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, said that He will destroy riba (usury) as He gives \r\n    increase for charity (cf. 2:276).

In that case it becomes permissible for him to commit a haraam deed, \r\n    or to refrain from or delay an obligatory deed so as to ward off harm that \r\n    he thinks most likely to befall him, within the limits of sharee&rsquo;ah.

Among the ways that Islam has permitted \r\n    the one who does not have money to get it is by doing permissible work, or \r\n    borrowing from someone without riba, or buying a product by instalments and \r\n    selling it for cash. It should be noted that many of these people may be \r\n    entitled to zakaah, and there is nothing wrong with them asking for it from \r\n    the institutions that collect zakaah from the Muslims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we think with regard to your case is that if you can get \r\n    the money in a way that is permissible according to sharee&rsquo;ah, then you have \r\n    no excuse for taking a riba-based loan. If you can pay the money that you \r\n    owe in instalments, then you also have no excuse. But if you cannot get the \r\n    money in a permissible manner, and not paying the money will result in you \r\n    being imprisoned, then we hope that you will be one of those who are excused \r\n    and compelled by necessity to engage in riba, and there will be no sin on \r\n    you, rather the sin will be on the one who lends you money on the basis of \r\n    riba, and on those who knew of your situation and did not help you when they \r\n    could. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should understand that the scholars say that necessity \r\n    should be evaluated properly. What this means in your case is that it is not \r\n    permissible for you to take from the bank anything but the amount that will \r\n    save you from harm. It is not permissible for you to take more than that. We \r\n    must also point out that if you can afford it after that, you must hasten to \r\n    pay the bank back if by doing so you will spare yourself from paying all or \r\n    some of the interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to help you to fear Him and do righteous deeds, \r\n    and to make you independent of means by His bounty, and to save you from \r\n    sin, and to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth, and to increase you \r\n    in guidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"10837","question_id":"10837","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we understand from your question is that you are going \r\n    to rent a house for one year, and pay 20,000 in advance, and in return for \r\n    that the landlord will reduce the rent from 1000 to 500 dirhams, in return \r\n    for his being able to benefit from the money that is paid in advance.

So we must beware of that which Allaah has forbidden and look for acceptable ways of saving our money and disposing of it. May Allaah help the Muslims to do that which will lead to their happiness, honour and salvation, and make it easy for them to work quickly to establish Islamic banks that are free of riba-based transactions, for He is Able to do that.

Allah, the Merciful, has stated that (interpretation of \r\nthe meaning): <\/p>\r\n<p><em>&quot;Allah does not require from a soul more than what it can bear&quot;. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>When the situation becomes too difficult and over-bearing, a Muslim enters in a state of &quot;adversity&quot; \r\nor &quot;necessity&quot; (al-dharoorah) where unlawful things (al-mahdhooraat) become permissible. This is a \r\ngreat rule in Islam which reflects its mercy and appreciation to its followers. However, this issue is \r\nvery sensitive as many Muslims, out of their ignorance, mistreat this rule. For example they neglect \r\nthe corollary which says: &quot;The state of necessity should be dealt with in proportion to its measure.&quot; \r\nTherefore it is very important to mention the constraints and conditions under which the rule of \r\nnecessity is applicable. Some of these are:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>That the level of harm associated with the unlawful action be less than that caused by the state \r\nof dharoorah.<\/li>\r\n<li>That the permissible degree or amount of the unlawful action he is allowed to commit be just \r\nenough to get him out of the state of dharoorah.<\/li>\r\n<li>That there is no other alternative in facing the state of dharoorah other than committing the \r\nunlawful act.<\/li>\r\n<li>That the duration of the concession be restricted to the duration of its cause.<\/li>\r\n<li>That the dharoorah is actually existing and not only anticipated or expected. <\/li>\r\n<li>When someone is faced by dharoorah and all its conditions and constraints are observed then \r\nthe unlawful thing becomes lawful to him.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Here are few practical examples to illustrate the above:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is permissible for the Muslim to eat from the dead animal if he finds nothing halaal to eat, and \r\nhe will die if he doesn't eat<\/li>\r\n<li>It is permissible for a Muslim to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) when he is under a painful \r\ntorturing that he cannot bear.<\/li>\r\n<li>It is permissible to deposit the money at the banks to save them from being lost or stolen, \r\nalthough that is considered to be helping the banks in their haraam interest transactions.<\/li>\r\n<li>It is permissible to enroll in car insurance (considering that most of the forms of car insurance \r\nare not acceptable in Islam) if he is in bad need to have a car and he is not allowed to drive one \r\nwithout insurance.<\/li>\r\n<li>It is permissible to complain to the &quot;civil courts&quot; (although they may not be implementing the \r\nIslamic law) to obtain one's rights if they is no other means to do so, provided one has the \r\nsound belief that there is no judgment except that of Allah.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Since the question inquires about transactions in particular, it is worth noting the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is never permissible to ask for riba nor to accept it under any circumstances.

Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the \r\npurification of one&rsquo;s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because \r\nAllaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and \r\ngood.<\/p>\r\n<p>This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and \r\nneedy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of \r\nIslam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. \r\nMoreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as constructing \r\nmosques, roads, etc&hellip; Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students \r\nstudying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of \r\nexpenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by \r\nunbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and \r\ndo not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is \r\nconsidered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to \r\nwhom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is \r\nconsidered as lost money that no one owns.<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims.<\/p>\r\n<p>Reference: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2\/401-411, &quot;What should one do who repents from \r\nearning forbidden money&quot;, Al-Fawzaan.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10886","question_id":"10886","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not permissible to \r\n    take out riba-based loans from the bank or elsewhere, even if that is to buy \r\n    a house to live in, because of the texts which state that riba is \r\n    emphatically forbidden, and the stern warning that is issued against it. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

If a man and a woman agree to commit zinaa \r\n(fornication or adultery), it does not become halaal. If a businessman agrees with the bank to \r\ndeposit a sum of money in the bank and take interest on it, or to take out a loan and pay \r\ninterest on it, that does not make such transactions halaal. Things that are haraam will remain so \r\nuntil the Day of Judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan is ignorant and inclined to do wrong. He may not even know what is in his own interests \r\nor in the interests of others, so he may do things that harm himself or others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou state in your question that you want to give some money to a person to invest it, in return \r\nfor something. There is nothing wrong with that if it is done in accordance with sharee&#146;ah, \r\nwhich includes a contract of silent partnership - i.e., you give money to someone to do \r\nbusiness on your behalf, in return for a agreed percentage of the profits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to sharee&#146;ah, a contract of silent partnership includes the following:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The one who receives the money for investment is not permitted to guarantee the capital \r\nand is not expected to repay it except in cases of recklessness or negligence.<\/li>\r\n<li>In the event of loss, the investor loses his capital and the one who took the money loses \r\nthe time and effort invested.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\nMay Allaah help you and us to earn a halaal income.

This is the most recent and most important book that has been published recently by the \r\n    researcher &lsquo;Abd al-Qaadir Yahya, which deals with the science of cupping.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This book is regarded as a scientific reference and medical dictionary that is \r\n    unique in the world because of its excellent explanations and scientific evidence. It is divided into 12 chapters, covering 500 pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the last chapter, he quotes clinical reports on the condition of some patients \r\n    who recovered or whose condition improved with the application of cupping, by comparing the reports on their sickness before cupping and after \r\n    cupping was applied. He also quotes the testimony of opinions of members of the Syrian medical team who took part in the research on cupping, who \r\n    numbered 25 clinical and laboratory experts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <h1><span>Details of the physical benefits of cupping<\/span>&nbsp;<\/h1>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Modern science has proven that cupping may be a cure for some heart diseases, \r\n    some blood diseases and some liver diseases. In cases where the lungs have become swollen because of heart failure, when all means of treatment \r\n    such as use of diuretics, tying the hands and feet to reduce the flow of blood to the heart have failed, releasing some of the blood by opening a \r\n    vein may be essential, to bring about a rapid recovery from heart failure. Similarly in the event of a sudden rise in blood pressure accompanied \r\n    by semi-consciousness and a loss of awareness of time and place, or accompanied by unconsciousness as a result of the sudden increase in blood \r\n    pressure, releasing some of the blood by opening a vein may be a treatment for such cases. Similarly, for some liver diseases such as cirrhosis \r\n    there may be no effective remedy apart from releasing some of the blood by opening a vein. There are also some blood diseases which are \r\n    distinguished by overproduction of red blood cells and a high ratio of haemoglobin in the blood, which require releasing some of the blood by \r\n    opening a vein, which is the most effective treatment in such cases, so as to avoid further complications. It is worth mentioning that an increase \r\n    in red blood cells may be the result of living in the mountains at high altitude and a low ratio of oxygen in the air, or it may be the result of \r\n    intense heat that has an obvious effect of increasing glandular excretions, which leads to an increase in the number of red blood cells. So \r\n    releasing some of the blood by opening a vein is the appropriate treatment in such cases. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;The best of the remedies that you use is cupping.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, 11634; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>al-Silsilah \r\n    al-Saheehah<\/i>, 1053.

This hadeeth indicates that it is a \r\n          disease, and in modern medicine, there is general consensus that alcohol \r\n          is harmful in all cases. Many ( researchers ) have written books and \r\n          articles on this topic, stating that the tissues of a forty-year old \r\n          drinker&rsquo;s body are like those of a sixty-year-old.

It is not permissible \r\n          for you to drink it. There are permissible medicines which you can use \r\n          to treat your kidneys, without using this thing.

This is the view of the majority of scholars.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Secondly<\/u>: all of a woman is &#145;awrah and is to be covered\r\n    before &#147;strangers&#146; (non-mahrams), because of the aayah (interpretation of the\r\n    meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them\r\n    from behind a screen&#148; [al-Ahzaab 33:53]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>and because of the hadeeth, &#147;All of a woman is &#145;awrah.&#148; (Narrated\r\n    by al-Tirmidhi with a saheeh isnaad).<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is the correct view according to the madhhab of the\r\n    Hanbalis, one of the two views of the Maalikis and one of the two views of the\r\n    Shaafa&#146;is.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Thirdly<\/u>: deliberately looking at &#145;awraat is one of the\r\n    things that are strongly forbidden. One is required to lower the gaze and refrain from\r\n    looking at them, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at\r\n    forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is\r\n    purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women\r\n    to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts\r\n    (from illegal sexual acts)&#133;&#148; [al-Noor 24:30-31]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;A\r\n    man should not look at the &#145;awrah of another man and a woman should not look at the\r\n    &#145;awrah of another woman.&#148; (Narrated by Muslim).<\/p>\r\n    <p>And he said to &#145;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with\r\n    him): &#147;Do not look at the thigh of anyone, living or dead.&#148; (Narrated by\r\n    Abu Dawood; it is a saheeh hadeeth).<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Fourthly<\/u>: if it is not permissible to look at\r\n    &#145;awraat it is also not permissible to touch any of them, even when there is some\r\n    cloth or clothing in between. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    said: &#147;I do not shake hands with women.&#148; (Narrated by Maalik and Ahmad.\r\n    This is a saheeh hadeeth). And he said: &#147;If one of you were to be\r\n    stabbed in the head with an iron needle, this would be better for him than if he were to\r\n    touch a woman whom it is not permitted for him to touch.&#148; (Narrated by\r\n    Tabaraani; it is a saheeh hadeeth). Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on\r\n    him) said: &#147;Where it is forbidden to look it is also forbidden to touch, and is more\r\n    forbidden, because that is more pleasurable.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Fifthly<\/u>: things that are considered to be &#145;awrah are of\r\n    varying types and degrees. The thing that is &#147;most &#145;awrah&#148; is the private\r\n    parts, front and back. Then there are things that are &#147;less &#145;awrah&#148; such as\r\n    a man's thighs in front of another man.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Sixthly<\/u>: young children under the age of seven are not subject\r\n    to the rulings on &#145;awrah. The &#145;awrah of boys who are able to distinguish matters\r\n    &#150; between the ages of seven and ten &#150; is the private parts, and the &#145;awrah\r\n    of girls of the same age is the area from the navel to the knees. (All of this is in cases\r\n    where there is no fear of fitnah). The &#145;awrah of a dead person is the same as the\r\n    &#145;awrah of a living person. To be on the safe side, a hermaphrodite (person whose sex\r\n    is not clear) should be considered to be a woman in terms of &#145;awrah, because such a\r\n    person may be a woman.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Sixthly<\/u>: in cases of necessity, things that are ordinarily\r\n    forbidden are permitted. The scholars are agreed that it is permissible for a male doctor\r\n    to look at the site of illness in a woman when necessary, within the limits set by\r\n    sharee&#146;ah. Similarly, a male doctor may look at the &#145;awrah of a sick man. But he\r\n    should look at the site of the complaint only as much as is necessary (and no more). The\r\n    rulings apply to female doctors as to male doctors. This ruling is based on the idea of\r\n    giving priority to the principle of saving life over the principle of covering the\r\n    &#145;awrah, in cases where there is a conflict between the two.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Seventhly<\/u>: &#147;Necessity should be evaluated according to its\r\n    degree.&#148; Although it is permissible to uncover, look and touch, etc., for the\r\n    purposes of treatment in cases of urgent necessity, it is not permissible under any\r\n    circumstances to go beyond the Islamic limits or ignore the regulations set out by\r\n    sharee&#146;ah. These regulations are as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Priority should be given to the treatment of men by men and women by\r\n        women. When a sick women needs to be uncovered (for medical treatment), preference should\r\n        be given to a qualified female Muslim doctor; if such is not available, the order of\r\n        preference is then a female non-Muslim doctor, a male Muslim doctor, and lastly, a male\r\n        non-Muslim doctor. If it is sufficient to be treated by a female general practitioner\r\n        (GP), she should not go to a male doctor even if he is a specialist. If a specialist is\r\n        needed, she should go to a female specialist, but if one is not available, then the female\r\n        patient may uncover in front of a male specialist. If the female specialist is not\r\n        qualified to treat the problem and the situation calls for the involvement of a\r\n        highly-skilled, qualified male specialist, then this is permissible. If there is a male\r\n        specialist who is more highly-skilled and more experienced than the female doctor, the\r\n        female patient should still not go to him unless the situation requires this extra level\r\n        of experience and skill. By the same token, a man should not be treated by a woman if\r\n        there is a man who is able to carry out the treatment.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>It is not permissible to uncover more than is necessary; only the area\r\n        that needs to be examined should be uncovered. At the same time, the doctor should try to\r\n        lower his gaze as much as he can, and he should be aware that he is doing something which\r\n        is basically forbidden, and he should seek the forgiveness of Allaah for anything he may\r\n        do which oversteps the mark.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>If describing the problem is sufficient, then it is not permissible to\r\n        uncover; if it is possible to examine the site of the problem by just looking, then it is\r\n        not permissible to touch; if it is possible to examine by touching with a cloth over the\r\n        site, then it is not permissible to remove the cloth, and so on.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>In allowing a woman to be treated by a male doctor, it is conditional\r\n        that she not be alone in the room with him. So the woman has to be accompanied by her\r\n        husband, mahram or another woman who is trustworthy.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The male doctor must also be trustworthy and above suspicion with regard\r\n        to his character and religious commitment. In this case it is sufficient to take people at\r\n        face value.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The more something is regarded as &#145;awrah, the more strictly should\r\n        the rules be applied. The author of <i>Kafaayat al-Akhyaar<\/i> said: &#147;Know that the\r\n        basic idea in cases of need is to look at the face and hands. In order to look at the rest\r\n        of the body, there should be a certain and definite need, and in order to look at the\r\n        private parts, there should be an extra-certain need. Hence one should be extremely strict\r\n        in cases such as childbirth and the circumcision of young girls.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The need for treatment should be urgent, such as sickness, unbearable\r\n        pain, worrying weakness and so on. If there is no sickness or urgency, then it is not\r\n        permissible to uncover the &#145;awrah, such as in cases where a person imagines he is\r\n        sick or in cases of cosmetic issues.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>All of the above applies only in cases where there is no fear of fitnah\r\n        or provocation of desire on the part of either the doctor or the patient.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Finally, it is essential to remember and fear Allaah with regard to\r\n    this important matter. The sharee&#146;ah has set out many precautions in order to be on\r\n    the safe side, and has prescribed clear and serious guidelines. One of the most widespread\r\n    problems of our times is the lax attitude that people have taken towards the issue of\r\n    uncovering the &#145;awrah in clinics and hospitals, as if it is permissible to show\r\n    everything to a doctor and to do any forbidden thing in his presence. The same applies to\r\n    educational programs which are brought without censorship from the kaafir countries,\r\n    imitating them by taking a lax attitude to such matters in the case of education, training\r\n    and information.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Muslims have to pay attention to educating qualified women in the\r\n    various specialties, so that needs may be met. They should also draw up schedules and\r\n    organize shifts in hospitals and clinics in such a way that Muslim women need never be put\r\n    in an awkward position, or feel neglected or be subjected to the annoyance of a male\r\n    doctor when she asks for a female doctor to treat her.<\/p>\r\n    <p>We ask Allaah to help us to understand our religion properly and to\r\n    help us to follow the rules of sharee&#146;ah and take care of the rights of the Muslims.\r\n    And He is the Source of help and the Guide to the Straight Path.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10947","question_id":"10947","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Islamic Fiqh Council answered this question as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Transplanting reproductive glands.

But if cupping \r\n  is done out of necessity it is beneficial at any time, even at the beginning \r\n  or end of the month.

With regard to specific days for administering \r\n  cupping, it was reported in a hadeeth narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Umar by Ibn Maajah \r\n  that the Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n  be upon him) said: &lsquo;Administer cupping, may Allaah bless you, on Thursdays, \r\n  and administer cupping on Mondays and Tuesdays, but avoid cupping on Wednesdays, \r\n  Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.&rsquo; It was reported with two da&rsquo;eef isnads, \r\n  and there is a third version, also da&rsquo;eef, reported by al-Daaraqutni in \r\n  <i>al-Afraad<\/i>. He also reported it with a jayyid isnaad from Ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n  but it is mawqoof (the isnad stops at the Sahaabi). Al-Khallaal reported that \r\n  Ahmad disliked cupping on the days mentioned, even though the hadeeth was not \r\n  proven. It was said that a man was treated with cupping on a Wednesday and he \r\n  developed leprosy because he ignored the hadeeth. Abu Dawood reported from Abu \r\n  Bakrah that he disliked cupping on Tuesdays, and said: &ldquo;The Messenger of \r\n  Allaah <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n  said: &lsquo;Tuesday is the day of blood, and on that day there is an hour when \r\n  blood does not stop.&rsquo; The doctors are agreed that cupping in the second \r\n  half of the month, especially in the third quarter, is more beneficial than \r\n  cupping at the beginning or end of the month. Al-Muwaffaq al-Baghdaadi said: \r\n  The body fluids (humours) flow heavily at the beginning of the month and calm \r\n  down at the end, so the best time to let the blood flow is in the middle of \r\n  the month.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>It is clear from the above that the ahaadeeth which specify \r\n  a particular time, when taken as a whole, indicate that there is a basis for \r\n  this, especially since the words of the doctors are in agreement with it. If \r\n  the seventeenth or nineteenth or twenty-first of a hijri month happens to be \r\n  a Thursday, this is the best possible time for cupping, but this is not to say \r\n  that it is not good to do it at other times.

Undoubtedly \r\n          this womb-renting will lead to confusion of lineage and not knowing \r\n          who the father or mother is. This confusion of lineage will lead to \r\n          disputes between the original wife and the woman whose womb is rented, \r\n          and it will not be known to whom the child belongs. Even if we say that \r\n          he belongs to one of them, the matter still will not be certain. Hence \r\n          we advise women to keep away from such things.&nbsp; Moreover, this \r\n          undoubtedly requires looking at &lsquo;awrahs and at the private parts which \r\n          it is forbidden to see, and it also requires collecting sperm and extracting \r\n          the eggs and placing them in other wombs. All of that is not allowed \r\n          in sharee&rsquo;ah, indeed it comes under prohibition mentioned in the aayah \r\n          (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><i> \r\n          <span>&ldquo;Tell the believing men to lower their \r\n          gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts \r\n          (from illegal sexual acts)&rdquo;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p><i> \r\n          <span>[al-Noor 24:30]<\/span><\/i><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> What \r\n          is meant is to protect them by covering them so that no one will see \r\n          the &lsquo;awrah of another. This is the way of Islam and we pay no attention \r\n          to those who deviate and go against that, and permit this borrowing \r\n          and this renting of wombs, the consequences of which will undoubtedly \r\n          be disastrous.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>--&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><span> \r\n          Renting wombs is one of the innovations of western civilization, \r\n          which is a purely materialistic civilization which does not give any \r\n          weight to moral values and principles. The issue is not things that \r\n          may affect inherited characteristics or confuse lineage; that is not \r\n          the point of the shar&rsquo;i ruling. Whether that leads to any effect on \r\n          inherited characteristics or not, whether that results in confusion \r\n          of lineage or not, it does not matter, because the shar&rsquo;i ruling forbidding \r\n          this innovation is based on something else, which is that the womb is \r\n          a part of a woman&rsquo;s private parts and the private parts (i.e., sexual \r\n          relations) are not permissible except through the shar&rsquo;i contract whose \r\n          conditions are fully met. So the womb is exclusively for the husband \r\n          who is married to that woman according to a valid marriage contract, \r\n          and no one else has any right to use it for an alien pregnancy. If the \r\n          woman who rents out her womb is not married to that husband, then she \r\n          is permitting her private parts and her womb to a man who is a stranger \r\n          to her; she is not permissible for him and he is not permissible for \r\n          her. Even if this is not full-scale zinaa (adultery), it is still definitely \r\n          haraam because it is enabling a man who is a stranger to her (i.e., \r\n          not married to her) to put his semen in her womb.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><i> \r\n          <span>Dr. &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeem al-Mat&rsquo;ani, al-Azhaar \r\n          University&nbsp;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>--&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><span> \r\n          The foetus is nourished and is influenced by the womb \r\n          and the environment that surrounds him. Bad habits on the part of the \r\n          surrogate mother may lead to deformity of the foetus, such as smoking, \r\n          drinking alcohol, etc. Then what if the doctors discover some physical \r\n          deformity in the foetus before birth and try to treat that by means \r\n          of surgical intervention? Will the surrogate mother allow that? Will \r\n          she put her life at risk for the sake of a child who does not belong \r\n          to her? Moreover, there are some women who become sick as a result of \r\n          pregnancy, suffering such diseases as a sudden rise in the level of \r\n          blood sugar, or a rise in blood pressure, or toxaemia, some of which \r\n          may take the life of the pregnant woman and which require medical intervention \r\n          to sacrifice the foetus in order to save the life of the pregnant woman. \r\n          How would the surrogate mother and the original mother work this out? \r\n          How are we to deal with the ethical, legal, social and psychological \r\n          problems that result from that? Therefore we can reach only one conclusion, \r\n          which is that the mother who carries the pregnancy can only be the original \r\n          mother, the child should be attributed to the marriage bed, and that \r\n          she should conceive, nourish her foetus and give birth to it. Saying \r\n          that renting wombs is like hiring wet-nurses has no basis in truth, \r\n          for a wet-nurse breastfeeds a child whose lineage is known, and she \r\n          can stop breastfeeding him when she wants or when the original mother \r\n          wants, if she feels that there is any danger. Moreover, in the relationship \r\n          between a husband and wife there is no room for any third party, no \r\n          matter who he or she is, not for renting a womb or for donating sperm \r\n          or donating eggs. Because of such things innumerable problems have arisen \r\n          in western societies. In Britain an original mother gave twenty thousand \r\n          pounds to a surrogate mother in return for renting her womb for nine \r\n          months. When that time was over, the surrogate mother demanded many \r\n          times that amount from the original mother in exchange for giving up \r\n          possession of the child. So if this door is opened it will bring us \r\n          innumerable legal and social problems.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Prof. Jamaal \r\n          Abu&rsquo;l-Suroor &ndash; Dean of Medicine, al-Azhaar<\/span> \r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"10968","question_id":"10968","answers":"Praise be to \r\n    Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If what is \r\n    meant is a medical examination to prove virginity, there is nothing wrong \r\n    with that if it is needed and is requested by the husband, especially if \r\n    there is some element of suspicion.

It has been definitely \r\n          proven by the doctors that this contraceptive method causes harm, especially \r\n          when it is used continually. It is known that the woman who has a coil \r\n          inserted has an increased flow of menstrual blood, and her period may \r\n          come twice a month, which causes an iron deficiency in her body. Iron \r\n          is one of the important minerals which the body needs. Some women may \r\n          become anaemic when they use the coil and it makes their periods longer, \r\n          resulting in the woman losing a large amount of blood and thus a large \r\n          amount of the iron stored in the body. It has also been proven that \r\n          many women suffer infections of the uterus as a result of using the \r\n          coil. Despite all this, a woman may become pregnant with the coil in \r\n          place, as has happened to a number of women.

We have to explain the ruling of Islam on this matter, after \r\n          quoting some details about it given by a group of Muslim scientists \r\n          and experts in this field:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> Definition \r\n          of cloning:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> It \r\n          is known that the laws of Allaah concerning His creation dictate that \r\n          the human being grows from the joining of two cells, the nucleus of \r\n          each of which contains a number of chromosomes, half the number of chromosomes \r\n          in the cells of the human body. When the cell of the father (the husband), \r\n          which is called the sperm, joins with the cell of the mother (the wife), \r\n          which is called the egg, they turn into a fertilized cell which contains \r\n          the complete number of chromosomes, and has the potential to multiply. \r\n          When it settles in the uterus of the mother, it grows and becomes a \r\n          whole new created being, by the will of Allaah. This cell multiplies, \r\n          so it becomes two identical cells, then four, then eight&hellip; then it continues \r\n          to multiply until it reaches the stage where the cells start to differ \r\n          from one another and become specialized. If, during the phase when the \r\n          cells are multiplying but have not yet begun to specialize, one cell \r\n          separates from the others, this will result in identical twins. Some \r\n          experiments have been done in which cells were artificially separated \r\n          from animal embryos, resulting in identical twins, but nothing of this \r\n          sort has been reported regarding human beings. This is regarded as a \r\n          kind of cloning, because it is producing identical copies, so it is \r\n          called cloning by splitting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> There \r\n          is another way of cloning a complete creature, which is done by taking \r\n          the complete number of chromosomes, in the form of a complete nucleus \r\n          from one of the cells of the body, and inserting it into an egg cell \r\n          from which the nucleus has been removed, thus forming a fertilized cell \r\n          containing a complete number of chromosomes and at the same time able \r\n          to multiply; if it is planted in the uterus of the mother it will develop \r\n          and grow and be born as a complete creature, by the will of Allaah. \r\n          This kind of cloning is known as nuclear transfer or nuclear insertion \r\n          in the egg cell. This is what is understood by the word &ldquo;cloning&rdquo; when \r\n          it is used, and this is what happened in the case of the sheep &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo;. \r\n          But this new creature is not an exact copy of the original, because \r\n          the egg of the mother from which the nucleus was removed still contains \r\n          some remnants of the nucleus in the material surrounding the removed \r\n          nucleus, and these remnants have a noticeable effect in altering the \r\n          characteristics which are inherited from the body cells, and this also \r\n          has not yet been reported to have been done with humans. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> So \r\n          cloning means producing one or more living beings by transferring the \r\n          nucleus of a body cell to an egg whose nucleus has been removed, or \r\n          splitting an fertilized egg at the stage before the tissues and organs \r\n          become distinct.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> It \r\n          is obvious that these and similar procedures do not represent the act \r\n          of creation, in whole or in part.
