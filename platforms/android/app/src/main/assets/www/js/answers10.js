Boxing is based on allowing \r\n          punches to the face of one's opponent using the maximum force that one \r\n          possesses. Blows to the face earn more points than blows to any other \r\n          part of the body. This clearly goes against the teaching of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him), as narrated by Abu Hurayrah: &#8220;When any one of you fights, \r\n          let him avoid (striking) the face.&#8221; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, <i><span>al-Fath<\/span><\/i>, \r\n          5\/215). <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Al-Haafiz said: &#8220;This prohibition also \r\n          includes all those who are struck for the purpose of <i><span>hadd<\/span><\/i> \r\n          or <i><span>ta&#8217;zeer<\/span><\/i> punishments \r\n          or discipline. According to the hadeeth narrated by Abu Bakrah and others, \r\n          which was recorded by Abu Dawood and others, about the woman who had \r\n          committed adultery, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that she should \r\n          be stoned to death, and said, &#8216;Stone her, but avoid the face.&#8217; (Narrated \r\n          by Abu Dawood, 4\/152).

In the minds of earlier nations, siyaahah was \r\n    connected to the concept of self-punishment and forcing oneself to travel \r\n    through the land, and exhausting the body as a punishment for it or as a way \r\n    of shunning this world. Islam abolished this negative concept of siyaahah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Haani&rsquo; narrated that Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked: Is a man \r\n    who travels about dearer to you, or one who stays in his city? He said: \r\n    Siyaahah has nothing to do with Islam, and it is not the action of the \r\n    Prophets or the righteous.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Talbees Iblees<\/i> (340).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali commented on the words of Imam Ahmad by \r\n    saying:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Siyaahah in this sense was done by some groups who are known \r\n    to strive in worship without knowledge; some of them gave up this activity \r\n    when they realized that it was not right.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> by Ibn Rajab \r\n    (1\/56).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam came to elevate the concept of siyaahah, and to connect \r\n    it to great and noble aims, such as the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Connecting siyaahah to worship. \r\n    So travel &ndash; or siyaahah &ndash; is enjoined in order to perform one of the pillars \r\n    of Islam, namely Hajj during certain months, and &lsquo;umrah to the House of \r\n    Allaah is prescribed throughout the year. When a man came to the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him for \r\n    permission for siyaahah (in the ancient sense of travelling as an act of \r\n    asceticism or self-punishment only), the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) guided him to something that is more sublime and \r\n    better than siyaahah. He said to him: &ldquo;The siyaahah of my ummah is jihad for \r\n    the sake of Allaah.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood (2486); classed as hasan by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>; its isnaad was classed as jayyid by \r\n    al-&lsquo;Iraaqi in <i>Takhreej Ihya&rsquo; &lsquo;Uloom al-Deen<\/i> (2641). Think about how \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made a \r\n    connection between the kind of siyaahah that is encouraged in sharee&rsquo;ah and \r\n    a great and noble aim.&nbsp; <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>In the Islamic worldview, \r\n    siyaahah is also connected to knowledge and learning. The greatest journeys \r\n    were undertaken at the beginning of Islam with the aim of seeking and \r\n    spreading knowledge. al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi wrote a famous book called <i>\r\n    al-Rihlah fi Talab<\/i> <i>al-Hadeeth<\/i> (Travelling to seek hadeeth) in \r\n    which he compiled the names of those who travelled for the sake of a single \r\n    hadeeth.

These \r\n    rulings include the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is haraam to travel for the \r\n    purpose of venerating a specific place, except the three mosques.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;No journey should be undertaken to visit any mosque but three: al-Masjid \r\n    al-Haraam, the Mosque of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) and the Mosque of al-Aqsa.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1132) and \r\n    Muslim (1397).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth indicates that it is haraam to undertake \r\n    &ldquo;religious journeys&rdquo;, as they are called, to any mosque other than these \r\n    three, such as those who call for travelling to visit graves or mashhads \r\n    (shrines) or tombs or mausoleums, especially those tombs that are venerated \r\n    by people and from which they seek blessing, and they commit all kinds of \r\n    shirk and haraam actions there. There is nothing in sharee&rsquo;ah to suggest \r\n    that places are sacred and that acts of worship should be done in them apart \r\n    from these three mosques. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: I went out to al-Toor (Sinai) where I met Ka&rsquo;b al-Ahbaar and sat \r\n    with him &hellip; He mentioned a lengthy hadeeth then he said: Then I met Basrah \r\n    ibn Abi Basrah al-Ghifaari who said: From where have you come? I said: From \r\n    Sinai. He said: If I had met you before you went out, you would not have \r\n    gone to that place. I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;Mounts are not to be ridden except to \r\n    three mosques: al-Masjid al-Haraam, this mosque of mine and the mosque of \r\n    Eeliya&rsquo; or Bayt al-Maqdis [Jerusalem].&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Maalik in <i>al-Muwatta&rsquo;<\/i> (108) and al-Nasaa&rsquo;i \r\n    (1430).

This does not mean that it is haraam to \r\n    visit mosques in Muslim lands, because visiting them is prescribed and is \r\n    mustahabb. Rather what is forbidden is setting out with that aim. If a \r\n    person has another reason for travelling, and he happens to visit the mosque \r\n    too, there is nothing wrong with that, rather he is obliged to pray Jumu&rsquo;ah \r\n    and prayers in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is even more haraam to travel to visit places that are \r\n    regarded as holy in other religions, such as those who go to visit the \r\n    Vatican or Buddhist idols and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The evidence also indicates \r\n    that it is haraam for the Muslim to travel in kaafir lands in general, \r\n    because of the evils that will affect the Muslim&rsquo;s religious commitment and \r\n    attitude as the result of mixing with those nations who pay no attention to \r\n    religion and morals, especially when there is no need for him to travel for \r\n    medical treatment or business and so on, rather it is just for leisure and \r\n    for fun.

If this is correct, \r\n    then it is not permissible to visit those places for the purpose of having a \r\n    look at them, because when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) passed though al-Hijr &ndash; which was where the houses of Thamood \r\n    were &ndash; he said: &ldquo;Do not enter the dwellings of those who wronged themselves \r\n    unless you are weeping, lest there befall you something like that which \r\n    befell them.&rdquo; Then he covered his head and urged his mount to move on \r\n    quickly until he left the place behind. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3200) and Muslim (2980).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, whilst \r\n    listing the lessons and rulings learned from the campaign to Tabook:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One who passes by the places of those who were subjected to \r\n    divine wrath or who were punished should not enter them or stay among them, \r\n    rather he should hasten to move on and should cover his head with his \r\n    garment until he has passed them, and he should not enter upon them unless \r\n    he is weeping and willing to learn a lesson. An example of this is when the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hastened to move on \r\n    in the valley of Muhsir, between Mina and Muzdalifah, because it was the \r\n    place where Allaah destroyed the elephant and its companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> (3\/560).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    commenting on the hadeeth quoted above:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This applies to the dwellings of Thamood and others like \r\n    them, though the reason was given concerning them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> (6\/380).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>Majmoo&rsquo;at Abhaath Hay&rsquo;at Kibaar al-&lsquo;Ulama&rsquo; \r\n    fi&rsquo;l-Mamlakat al-&lsquo;Arabiyyah al-Sa&rsquo;oodiyyah<\/i>, vol. 3, essay entitled <i>\r\n    Hukm Ihya&rsquo; Diyaar Thamood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no. \r\n    [fatin]20894[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; It is also not permissible for a woman to travel without \r\n    a mahram.

If a kaafir tourist is \r\n    granted permission by a Muslim state to enter, then he is granted safety \r\n    until he leaves. But during his stay in the Muslim country he should be \r\n    required to show respect for the Islamic religion and the morals and culture \r\n    of the Muslims; he should not call people to his religion or claim that \r\n    Islam is false, and he should only go out in clothes that are appropriate \r\n    for a Muslim country, not as they are accustomed to dress in their country, \r\n    semi naked and decadent. He should not be a helper or spy for his people. \r\n    And finally the kuffaar should not be allowed to visit the two Holy \r\n    Sanctuaries in Makkah and Madeenah al-Munawwarah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obvious to everyone that tourism (siyaahah) nowadays \r\n    mostly involves sin, immoral deeds and transgression of the sacred limits, \r\n    such as deliberate wanton display and nakedness, permissive mixing, drinking \r\n    of alcohol, promotion of corruption, imitation of the kuffaar and \r\n    introduction of their customs and ways, and even their diseases, let alone a \r\n    waste of money, time and effort. All of that happens in the name of tourism. \r\n    We remind everyone who is concerned about his religion, morals and ummah not \r\n    to help to promote this evil kind of tourism; rather he should fight it and \r\n    fight against the culture that it promotes; he should be proud of his \r\n    religion, culture and morals, for they will protect him against all evils, \r\n    and give him an alternative in the conservative Muslim lands. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9010","question_id":"9010","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise be to \r\n          Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Taking pictures of women is not permitted at all, because \r\n          of the temptation and evil that results from that, in addition to the \r\n          fact that taking pictures is forbidden in and of itself.

These are the pleasures enjoyed by sinners and\r\n        negligent people to varying degrees, such as those who enjoy zina (illegal sexual\r\n        conduct), drinking wine, stealing, and so on. It will be said to them on the Day of\r\n        Resurrection (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <i><p>&ldquo;You received your good things in the life of the world, and you\r\n      took your pleasure therein&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Ahqaaf 46:20]<\/p>\r\n      <\/i>\r\n      <li><p>Pleasures which will not be punished in the Hereafter, but\r\n        overindulgence causes a person to miss out on achieving higher levels and keeps him from\r\n        earning reward. These are the permissible pleasures of those who are negligent, which they\r\n        do not do in order to better themselves or to earn reward, and they have no intention of\r\n        worship when they do these things. Examples include going to extremes in matters of food,\r\n        drink, transportation, accommodation, travelling and going on vacation, and other things\r\n        that are not inherently harmful or sinful.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Pleasures for which a person will be rewarded. These pleasures belong\r\n        exclusively to the believers who let themselves enjoy them on the grounds of doing their\r\n        duty towards themselves, seeking help thereby to obey Allaah, and helping to keep\r\n        themselves away from sin.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p>On the basis of these noble aims, these pleasures may be classified as\r\n      acts of obedience towards Allaah, concerning which the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n      Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah will be pleased with a slave who eats some food\r\n      then praises Allaah for it, and drinks some drink then praises Allaah for it.&rdquo; (Reported\r\n      by Muslim, 2734, from the hadeeth of Anas). He also said. &ldquo;In your\r\n      intercourse with your wife, there is reward.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah,\r\n      can anyone of us have sexual enjoyment and be rewarded for that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Do\r\n      you not see that if you do that in a haraam manner, you will be punished for it? So if you\r\n      do it in a halaal manner, you will be rewarded.&rdquo; (As in the hadeeth of Abu\r\n      Dharr, reported by Muslim, 1006).<\/p>\r\n      <p>It is clear from the hadeeth that enjoying these worldly\r\n      pleasures on the basis of praising Allaah, recognizing His bounty and seeking to protect\r\n      oneself from doing forbidden things will bring reward from Allaah. Praise be to Allaah for\r\n      His blessings. (See <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fawaa&rsquo;id<\/i> by Ibn Sa&rsquo;di, p.\r\n      234). Thus we know that in Islam there are permissible pleasures, having to\r\n      do with eating and drinking permissible foods and enjoying permissible kinds of clothing\r\n      and means of transportation, and there are pleasures for which a person will be rewarded\r\n      in the Hereafter, in addition to his enjoyment of them in this world, such as the one who\r\n      eats with the intention of gaining the strength to obey Allaah, or who sleeps with the\r\n      intention of helping himself to get up to pray Qiyaam al-Layl and Fajr, or the one who has\r\n      intercourse with his wife with the intention of keeping himself and her chaste, keeping\r\n      them both away from sin, and with the hope of having a child, or the one who works hard at\r\n      his trade or job with the intention of spending on himself and his family and his parents,\r\n      and so on.

He has duties which he must perform, towards Allaah, may He be glorified, and\r\n    towards other people.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Muslim has lots of ways in which he can fulfil these\r\n    duties in the manner required by sharee&rsquo;ah; these ways will bring him great rewards,\r\n    and he is not hindered by difficult conditions or time restrictions.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Islam wants the Muslim, after fulfilling his obligatory\r\n    duties, to use his spare time for beneficial and fruitful pursuits which will help him to\r\n    draw closer to Allaah, from the moment he wakes until he goes to sleep. This will leave\r\n    him with no free time to pose a problem whereby he feels a need to fill it with activities\r\n    that will drain his energy or squander it in inappropriate ways. <\/p>\r\n    <p>This does not mean that human beings are to be kept busy in a\r\n    way that will exhaust and drain them&hellip; that is not one of the aims of Islam, as Islam\r\n    calls man to enjoy the good things and remember his share (of enjoyment) in this world.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Not everything with which a person may fill his time is\r\n    exhausting and energy-draining. One thing we may do is to spend time in quiet worship,\r\n    remembering Allaah in our hearts. Other things include taking a nap after Zuhr when it is\r\n    hot; spending time chatting about decent topics with family or friends in the evening;\r\n    visiting one another; joking in gentle and polite ways, and other forms of relaxation.<\/p>\r\n    <p>But it is important not to leave gaps where a person has\r\n    nothing to do, or which may be filled with evil, corrupt or foolish things. Islam\r\n    abolished the customs, festivals, celebrations and ways of life of the Jaahiliyyah, but it\r\n    did not leave a vacuum which the Muslims would not know how to fill, or which they may\r\n    fill with useless things without realizing it. On the contrary, Islam replaced those\r\n    things with other customs, festivals, celebrations and ways of life to fill the gap.\r\n    During the Jaahiliyyah, people used to gather to drink and gamble, or to worship idols, or\r\n    to listen to misguided poetry which did not speak of any worthwhile human concerns. But\r\n    Islam brought people together to worship Allaah by performing the prayer in congregation,\r\n    to learn and recite the Qur&rsquo;aan together, to listen to the teachings of the Messenger\r\n    of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to visit one another, etc.\r\n    Previously, they had done evil and immoral acts during their festivals, but Islam\r\n    abolished all that and gave them instead festivals which were noble, pure and filled with\r\n    meaning and worthy aims.<\/p>\r\n    <p>During the early days of Islam, when family ties were cut\r\n    with Mushrikeen who had not yet become Muslim, the gap was filled by the close ties\r\n    between the believers, which took the place of kinship. The gap was truly filled, and the\r\n    ties of faith became equivalent to the ties of blood for the believers. When the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) established the mu&rsquo;aakhah (brotherhood)\r\n    between the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, it reached such a degree that the Ansaar shared\r\n    everything they had with the Muhaajireen.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&ldquo;&hellip; and [they &ndash; the Ansaar] have no jealousy\r\n    in their hearts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Bani al-Nadeer),\r\n    and give them (emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of\r\n    that&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Hashr 59:9]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>It reached the extent that the people between whom the bond\r\n    of <i>Mu&rsquo;aakhah<\/i> (brotherhood) was established could inherit from one another, and\r\n    so the believers did not feel that there was anything missing.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(Muhammad Qutub, <i>Manhaj al-Tarbiyyah al-Islamiyyah<\/i>,\r\n    1\/206)<\/p>\r\n    <p>So this problem does not exist in the Islamic\r\n    way of life. The one who constantly remembers Allaah and worships Him cannot find any\r\n    empty time that needs to be filled. He is busy remembering Allaah and doing voluntary acts\r\n    of worship after doing what is obligatory. He keeps himself busy memorizing Qur&rsquo;aan\r\n    and reciting it in worship of Allaah.

With regard to zoos in countries where it is not possible to achieve\r\n    this kind of reform, Muslims should choose the most suitable time to take their children\r\n    to the zoo; they should avoid places of evil and protect themselves and their children\r\n    from seeing anything that could adversely affect their faith.

The ahaadeeth which say something \r\n    similar are many and well known.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is well known that \r\n    looking is the cause of zina, because the one who looks a great deal at the \r\n    beauty of a woman &ndash; for example &ndash; may develop a strong love for her in his \r\n    heart as a result of that, which may be the cause of his doom &ndash; Allaah \r\n    forbid &ndash; for the gaze is the route to zina.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Adwa&rsquo; al-Bayaan<\/i> \r\n    (5\/510)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is seen in soap \r\n    operas, movies and plays of the blatant and wanton display of women \r\n    (tabarruj), and their soft voices, enticing walks, dancing and singing &ndash; all \r\n    of these are things that are forbidden in the religion of Allaah, and they \r\n    are among the easiest means that enable the shaytaan to enter and settle in \r\n    the heart of the viewer, when he can take the reins and direct the person \r\n    and his physical faculties in ways that incur the wrath of the Lord, may He \r\n    be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth quoted above, \r\n    &ldquo;The zina of the eyes is looking, and the zina of the ear is hearing&rdquo; \r\n    undoubtedly applies to these shows. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>No one should dispute the \r\n    bad effects that these soap operas and movies have on societies in general, \r\n    and on young men and women in particular.

And young men may become infatuated with beautiful actresses and \r\n    for that reason they forego halaal marriage in pursuit of haraam pleasure. \r\n    In addition to that there is the effect that these shows may have of \r\n    diluting Islamic beliefs, teaching violence, making crime look attractive, \r\n    making people dare to drink alcohol, keep company with non-mahram women and \r\n    other bad effects. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See also the answers to \r\n    questions no.

Some of them are of the view that it is \r\n    not allowed at all, others are of the view that it is permissible without \r\n    any reservations. Yet others differentiated between some of its practices \r\n    and others; they allowed those that are in accordance with sharee&lsquo;ah and \r\n    forbade those that are contrary to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    None of them denied &ndash; as far as we know &ndash; that the origin of \r\n    this practice stems from idolatrous Hindu beliefs then Buddhism. Hence those \r\n    who allow it in all cases took away from it anything that has to do with \r\n    beliefs and spiritual matters, and passed the ruling on it on the basis that \r\n    it is regarded as physical exercise. Those who forbade it did so because of \r\n    its religious origins and the resemblance to those idol worshippers, and \r\n    because of the harm it causes to the body, and other reasons. As for those \r\n    who differentiate between one type and another, their opinion is not \r\n    acceptable because it is not possible to eliminate the bad and because \r\n    people are not able to distinguish between what is permissible and what is \r\n    forbidden in it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it is both spiritual and physical exercise which was \r\n    originally aimed at reaching oblivion and entering into a state of \r\n    connection with God!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the book <i>al-Yoga wa&rsquo;l-Tanaffus<\/i> (yoga and breathing) \r\n    by Muhammad &lsquo;Abd al-Fattaah Faheem (p. 19), it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Yoga in the sacred Indian language means union and contact \r\n    with God, i.e., union between the body, the mind and God which helps man \r\n    attain knowledge and wisdom and develops his thought by developing his \r\n    knowledge of life; it protects him from sectarianism, religious fanaticism, \r\n    narrowmindedness and shortsightedness when searching; it makes him live a \r\n    life of contentment both physically and spiritually.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>al-Mu&lsquo;jam al-Falsafi<\/i> by Jameel Sulayba (2\/590) it \r\n    says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Yoga is a Sanskrit word which means union; it is used to \r\n    refer to a kind of spiritual exercise that is practised by the wise men of \r\n    India for the purpose of union with the universal spirit. Yoga is not a \r\n    school of philosophical thought; rather it is an artistic way of doing some \r\n    exercises that release the soul from physical and mental gravity and take it \r\n    step-by-step towards reality. The Yogi is the wise man who practices this \r\n    way.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Both quotes taken from <i>Mazaahirat al-Tashabbuh \r\n    bi&rsquo;l-Kuffaar fi&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Asr al-Hadeeth wa Atharuha &lsquo;ala al-Muslimeen<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the definition of Yoga we see that it means union, i.e., \r\n    union of man with the spirit, which is the universal spirit, by which they \r\n    mean God. Hence the aim of this practice is to be a way of combining all \r\n    other religions. Dr Ahmad Shalabi &ndash; who is a specialist in the religions of \r\n    India &ndash; says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;The union of Buddha with the Hindu gods is nothing but a \r\n    return to belief in &lsquo;Jnana Yoga&rsquo; i.e., the &lsquo;path of knowledge&rsquo; which sees \r\n    truth in all religions and philosophies. But this truth is only a particle \r\n    of the greater, complete truth. This school of thought does not object to \r\n    any religion or philosophy; it thinks that any religion or philosophy is not \r\n    everything and is not the whole truth. The one who believes in this way of \r\n    thinking does not belong to any religion or school of thought, because he \r\n    regards the followers of all different religions as his brothers, no matter \r\n    how they differ. So Jnana Yoga is a way that encompasses all beliefs and \r\n    refuses to be restricted by any of them. We should highlight the fact that \r\n    propagating and promoting this way of thinking is aimed at fighting Islam \r\n    indirectly. I have seen these attempts in several countries. Islam is the \r\n    force that defeated both Christian and Buddhist missionaries, so if they can \r\n    manage to divert people in one way or another &ndash; even in the name of Jnana \r\n    Yoga that encompasses all beliefs and does not restrict itself to any one of \r\n    them &ndash; that is a great victory for them. After they have managed to divert \r\n    the Muslim from Islam at the end of this smart trick, then it is possible to \r\n    make him doubt and then pull him into another sphere. So let the Muslim \r\n    beware of Yoga and its trickery and those who promote it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Adyaan al-Hind al-Kubra<\/i>, p. 174&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We think that forbidding it altogether is the correct \r\n    approach. We have studied the words of many concerning this practice, and we \r\n    have decided to sum up the comments on it from a book that deals \r\n    specifically with the ruling on this practice, by a writer whom we trust \r\n    with regard to his methodology and beliefs; he is a doctor who knows what he \r\n    is saying when he criticises it even from a health point of view. This \r\n    writer is Dr Faaris &lsquo;Alwaan and his book is called <i>al-Yoga fi Mizaan \r\n    al-Naqd al-&lsquo;Ilmi<\/i>, which was published by Darussalam in Cairo. Everything \r\n    that we will quote below is from this book, but it should be noted that we \r\n    cannot quote everything that it says in the book. Hence we will limit it to \r\n    a definition of this practice and the discussion of the Islamic ruling on \r\n    it; whoever wants to know more may refer to the book.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is Yoga?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yoga means union; one of its prominent teachers says that it \r\n    is union of man with the spirit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yoga involves various exercises and rituals, but the most \r\n    important and most famous of them is an exercise called Surya Namaskar \r\n    [known in English as the &ldquo;Sun Salutation&rdquo;], which means in Sanskrit: \r\n    &ldquo;prostration to the sun on eight parts of the body&rdquo;. And they defined these \r\n    parts as the two feet, the two knees, the two hands, the chest and the \r\n    forehead.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is preferable for the one who practices yoga to be naked, \r\n    especially the chest, back and thighs; to face the sun when it is rising and \r\n    when it is setting if he wants Yoga that is sound and beneficial; and to fix \r\n    his gaze and focus his attention on the disc of the sun, and be attached to \r\n    it completely, which includes his body, his faculties, his mind and his \r\n    heart. If he is in a built-up area and cannot see the sun, he is allowed to \r\n    draw the disc of the sun in front of him on the wall. One of them said: If \r\n    the one who is practising yoga is a believer in a religion and is concerned \r\n    about committing an act of disbelief, there is nothing wrong with him \r\n    drawing any image in front of him and focusing on it completely!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yoga also includes pondering one&rsquo;s body deeply and thinking \r\n    of and examining every part of the body, starting with the toes and going up \r\n    to the head when waking up and before getting up from one&rsquo;s bed, and doing \r\n    the opposite, from the head down to the toes just before sleeping, and it is \r\n    not allowed to forget or be distracted from this important task!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever wants to benefit from yoga should also be \r\n    vegetarian.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he has to repeat specific words out loud whilst doing \r\n    these exercises. These words are called mantras, the most famous of which \r\n    are the beeja mantras, which are hram, hreem, hraim, hraum, hara. Some \r\n    syllables are also repeated in yoga, such as Aum (or Om).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In addition to that, it is essential to repeat the twelve \r\n    names of the sun, because this is a major and important part of Yoga.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Names of the sun include:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Rafanama, which means, &ldquo;I bow my head to you, O one whom \r\n    everyone praises.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Suryanama, which means, &ldquo;I bow my head to you, O guide of \r\n    all.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Bahaanafinama, which means, &ldquo;I bow my head to you, O bestower \r\n    of beauty.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Safeetarnama, which means, &ldquo;I bow my head to you, O bestower \r\n    of life&rdquo; etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And they claim that this repetition is very beneficial.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of those who practices yoga says that he wakes up at 3.30 \r\n    a.m. and continues practising yoga and offering its special prayers until \r\n    6:15 a.m. And in the evening he does the same thing from 6 p.m. until 6:30 \r\n    p.m.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus he spends three and a quarter hours every day practising \r\n    yoga, and he says that some of them spend more time than that, claiming that \r\n    the more time they spend on it the more beneficial it is.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Yoga fi Mizaan al-Naqd al-&lsquo;Ilmi<\/i>, \r\n    p. 13-18&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Islamic ruling on practising yoga&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up, it is not permissible for the Muslim to practice \r\n    yoga at all, whether he does it on the basis of belief or imitating others, \r\n    or because he is seeking a particular so-called benefit. That is due to a \r\n    number of reasons which we may conclude from what is mentioned above, and \r\n    which we will sum up as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because Yoga is contrary to Tawheed and involves associating \r\n    other deities with Allah, may He be exalted, and because it involves \r\n    prostrating to the sun and repeating its names.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>Say (O Muhammad): I am \r\n    commanded only to worship Allaah (Alone) and not to join partners with Him<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Ra&lsquo;d 13:36]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>If you join others in worship \r\n    with All&acirc;h, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will \r\n    certainly be among the losers<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Zumar 39:65]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because it involves imitation of idol worshippers and \r\n    resembling them, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Whoever imitates a people is one of them.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, Abu \r\n    Dawood and al-Tabaraani from Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because some of its practices are harmful to most people and \r\n    lead to serious health consequences for them. Some of its practices involve \r\n    sitting in a very strange and shameful way, and sitting in a lazy way, \r\n    oblivious to what is going on around one. This is also harmful from a health \r\n    and psychological point of view. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Maajah from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -4-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because it is a waste of time doing something that does not \r\n    bring anything but harm and loss in this world, and calamity and despair in \r\n    the Hereafter. The trustworthy Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;A person&rsquo;s feet will not move on, on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection, until he has been asked about four things: his life and how he \r\n    spent it, his knowledge and what he did with it, his wealth and from where \r\n    he acquired it and on what he spent it, and his body and how he used it.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from Abu Barzah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -5-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because it is a clear call to imitate animals and detracts \r\n    from human dignity, such as: adopting nakedness, resting on all fours in \r\n    most of the exercises (Surya Namaskar or sun salutation) and the special \r\n    posture in the third and eighth exercises.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -6-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because many of those who tried to practice what is called \r\n    scientific yoga or behavioural therapy fell into the pit of drugs and \r\n    addiction, and this remedy has been proven to be ineffective and of no \r\n    benefit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -7-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because it is based on lies and charlatanry; its promoters \r\n    rely on deceit and twisting the facts in spreading it. Thus it attracted the \r\n    attention of a large number of those who are simple-natured and many of \r\n    those who are weak in faith.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -8-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because a few of those who practice yoga or some other \r\n    esoteric or deviant trends may perform extraordinary feats, people are \r\n    deceived by it. But in most cases they are only using devils among the jinn \r\n    as in the case of magic and so on, and this is haraam according to Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -9-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Most of the advice given by the promoters of yoga is harmful \r\n    to the individual, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Nakedness and what it causes of \r\n    cultural, sexual, psychological and physical diseases.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Exposing the skin to the sun. \r\n    We have seen the harm that this causes, especially when there is lengthy \r\n    exposure to the sun.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Fixing the gaze on the disc of \r\n    the sun, which causes severe damage to the eyes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Encouraging a vegetarian diet \r\n    for which Allah has not revealed any authority.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Yoga fi Mizan al-Naqd al-&lsquo;Il<\/i>mi, \r\n    p. 84-86&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9024","question_id":"9024","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      How good it is that this Muslim girl, who is so young, is \r\n      keen to ask about matters of her religion and is keen to make her life, \r\n      behaviour and attitude in accordance with her religion.

To proceed:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is well known that the game of backgammon is the &ldquo;dice&rdquo; \r\n    concerning which reports were narrated stating that it is haraam, such as \r\n    the report in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> from Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Whoever plays with dice, it is as if he were dipping his hand in \r\n    the flesh and blood of a pig.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim (2260) from the hadeeth of \r\n    Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him). The word translated as &ldquo;dice&rdquo; in \r\n    this hadeeth refers to the game of backgammon. Moreover there are other \r\n    hadeeths which say that it is not permitted, and many of the scholars have \r\n    stated that it is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to chess, most of the scholars have also stated \r\n    that it is haraam to play it. al-Bayhaqi narrated in <i>al-Sunan al-Kubra<\/i> \r\n    (10\/212) from &lsquo;Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that he passed by some \r\n    people who were playing chess and he said: What are these images that you \r\n    are so devoted to?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This ruling, meaning the ruling that it is haraam according \r\n    to most of the scholars, applies if both backgammon and chess of free of \r\n    other things that are contrary to sharee&lsquo;ah, the worst of which are: if it \r\n    is played in return for money, because then it is gambling which is haraam \r\n    according to consensus, as was stated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah; if it \r\n    leads to missing prayer; and if it creates grudges between people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, the ruling does not vary whether the game of chess \r\n    or backgammon is played in real life or on a computer or online. The Muslim \r\n    is enjoined to make good use of his time and not waste it, as &lsquo;Umar \r\n    al-Farooq (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If you want to spend leisure \r\n    time, then spend it practising archery, and if you want to talk, then talk \r\n    about obligatory duties.

The worst things that you will find in some cases \r\n    are stories of love and infatuation between a scholar or mujaahid and a girl \r\n    who is in love with him!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Showing those great men in an abhorrent manner that is \r\n    contrary to sharee&lsquo;ah, in terms of clothing and appearance, and going \r\n    further than that by depicting their families and womenfolk in contemporary \r\n    style, according to the whims and desires of the people in charge of the \r\n    production.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is shown of free mixing between men and women in those \r\n    dramas, and who knows what goes on during filming and beforehand. Indeed, \r\n    anyone who knows the nature of that environment, and the attitude of the \r\n    people involved and those who work in it, does not need any further \r\n    information to find it reprehensible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is played of music before the show begins, during it and \r\n    at the end.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Wanton display and unveiling in all types of TV shows is \r\n    obvious to anyone. The appearance of women in the first place is not \r\n    permissible, so how about if women appear wearing make-up and adorned?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What some of these shows include of dancing, singing and \r\n    drinking alcohol on the part of slave women, which is shown on the grounds \r\n    of showing what really happened of immoral deeds and blatant sin, which also \r\n    involves telling lies and distorting the biographies of many of those whose \r\n    life stories they claim to be presenting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Portrayal by actors of the Sahaabah in a very bad way; these \r\n    roles may be played by an actor who is an evildoer or a disbeliever!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]14488[\\fatin] you will find the ruling \r\n    on playing the role of the Sahaabah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Playing the role of a disbeliever who wears a cross or \r\n    prostrates to it, or the role of a disbeliever who reviles the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or Islam. All of that is \r\n    tantamount to disbelief in Allah, may He be exalted, and apostasy from \r\n    Islam. We do not know of any shar&lsquo;i concession that allows actors to say or \r\n    do anything that constitutes kufr.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This also applies to the one who does plainly evil actions in \r\n    a real manner, such as one who drinks real alcohol when acting, or he kisses \r\n    a woman who is not permissible for him, and so on. In fact the scholars have \r\n    stated that it is haraam to pretend to do such things or to imitate people \r\n    who do such things, such as the one who drinks water in the manner of one \r\n    who drinks alcohol, and the like.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Distracting the Muslims and wasting their time with the \r\n    foolish drama shows that present a distorted picture of our glorious history \r\n    or of a great character, or that provoke desires in young men and women, or \r\n    encourage them to form haraam relationships, and many other things contained \r\n    in these shows.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is regrettable that this distraction comes to the Muslims \r\n    in Ramadan, which is the month of the Qur&rsquo;aan, qiyaam and i&lsquo;tikaaf. This is \r\n    indicative of evil intent and plotting on the part of the devils of mankind, \r\n    who take on the role of the chained devils and distract the Muslims from \r\n    obedience and worship, and cause them to watch and listen to haraam things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we think that it is not permissible for the Muslim to \r\n    watch any type of these shows, and that the prohibition is more emphatic \r\n    when they contain many things that are contrary to sharee&lsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is required of every Muslim, man and woman, is to avoid \r\n    these evils and to beware of them. The same applies to watching TV shows \r\n    that include wanton display on the part of women. It is haraam to watch them \r\n    because of the grave danger that watching them poses of causing spiritual \r\n    sickness and loss of protective jealousy, and because that might cause him \r\n    to fall into that which Allah has forbidden, whether the viewer is a man or \r\n    a woman.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, 3\/72&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information please see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatout]118513[\\fatout],\r\n    [fatin]125535[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatout]63704[\\fatout]<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9032","question_id":"9032","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Many computer games involve things that are contrary to \r\n    sharee&lsquo;ah, such as music, uncovering &lsquo;awrahs, venerating the cross, learning \r\n    violence and committing crimes, and neglecting obligatory duties. We have \r\n    explained in the answers to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]2898[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]39744[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]98769[\\fatin] the negative \r\n    consequences of computer games. In the second of these answers (39744) we \r\n    have explained the ruling on buying and selling them; and in the first \r\n    answer (2898) we mentioned &ndash; when explaining what is haraam concerning them \r\n    &ndash; games which are based on glorifying the cross and in which passing over it \r\n    gives health or strength, or brings one back to life, or gives the player \r\n    extra &ldquo;lives&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if these computer games are based on such \r\n    things then playing them is haraam, and it is also haraam to buy and sell \r\n    them, whether the thing that gives strength or lives is the cross or a \r\n    charm, as is the case in Japanese and Chinese games. But if gaining strength \r\n    for the player is done by means of training that he does, and not any of the \r\n    things we have mentioned, then it seems to us that it is permissible to play \r\n    these games.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to imitating the creation of Allah that is \r\n    mentioned in the question, the response is in two parts, from the linguistic \r\n    point of view and from the shar &lsquo;i ruling point of view.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the linguistic meaning, the discussion centres \r\n    on what is meant by imitating or trying to match. Al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad \r\n    al-Faraaheedi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imitating means trying to match one thing to another. Allah, \r\n    may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <i>&ldquo;They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of \r\n    old&rdquo; [at-Tawbah 9:30]<\/i>. What is meant is: They say \r\n    something like they (the disbelievers of old) said. And in the hadeeth it \r\n    says: &ldquo;The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-&lsquo;Ayn<\/i>, 4\/70; <i>an-Nihaayah fi \r\n    Ghareeb al-Hadeeth<\/i> by Ibn al-Atheer, 3\/232&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the shar&lsquo;i ruling, it is mentioned in these \r\n    words and synonyms in saheeh hadeeths, including the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of \r\n    Resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5610; Muslim, 2107.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to a version narrated by Muslim: &ldquo;Verily, among the \r\n    people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be \r\n    those who imitate the creation of Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger \r\n    of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: &ldquo;Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted, said: &lsquo;Who does more wrong than the one who tries to \r\n    imitate My creation? Let them create an ant, or let them create a grain of \r\n    wheat, or let them create a grain of barley.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5609; Muslim, 2111.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This competing or imitating mentioned in the hadeeth is that \r\n    which constitutes kufr. That applies in two cases:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Where the image maker makes an \r\n    idol &ndash; or a representation of something else that Allah created &ndash; to be \r\n    worshipped<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Where the image maker makes the \r\n    image and claims that it is better than the creation of Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more details on that, please see the answer to question \r\n    no. [fatout]149026[\\fatout]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This does not apply to games that contain characters that are \r\n    animated beings, because they are not intended to match or compete with the \r\n    creation of Allah. But that does not mean that they are permissible in all \r\n    cases. Rather what we think is that they are only permissible for children, \r\n    not adults, so they come under the same rulings as cartoons.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) came back from the campaign to Tabook or Khaybar and there was a \r\n    curtain over her niche. The wind lifted the edge of the curtain and \r\n    uncovered &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah&rsquo;s toy dolls. He said: &ldquo;What is this, O &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah?&rdquo; She \r\n    said: My dolls. He saw among them a horse with two wings made of cloth and \r\n    he said: &ldquo;What is this that I see in the midst of them?&rdquo; She said: A horse. \r\n    He said: &ldquo;What is this that I see on it?&rdquo; I said: Two wings. He said: &ldquo;A \r\n    horse with wings?&rdquo; She said: Have you not heard that Sulaymaan had horses \r\n    with wings? She said: And the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) smiled so broadly that I saw his eyeteeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4932; classed as saheeh by al-&lsquo;Iraaqi \r\n    in <i>Takhreej al-Ihya&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/344; and by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi \r\n    Dawood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth was quoted as evidence that it is permissible to \r\n    make dolls and toys for little girls to play with; this is an exception from \r\n    the general prohibition on keeping images. This was the view of &lsquo;Iyaad, who \r\n    narrated it from the majority; and they regarded it as permissible to sell \r\n    toys to little girls to train them from an early age to take care of their \r\n    houses and children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 10\/527&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Sa&lsquo;d ibn Turki al-Khathlaam (may Allah preserve him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Cartoons do not in fact show real images of that which Allah, \r\n    may He be exalted, has created; rather they are images drawn with the hand, \r\n    so the imitation in this case is not obvious; however, cartoons are drawings \r\n    of animate beings, so in principle they come under the heading of haraam \r\n    image-making. But if the target audience of these films is small children, \r\n    which is what appears to be the case here &ndash; and Allah knows best &ndash; then \r\n    there is nothing wrong with it, because of the reports which indicate that \r\n    such things are permissible for small children. And we said that with regard \r\n    to images, in the case of small children that may be tolerated which may not \r\n    be tolerated in the case of adults. So if the target audience for whom the \r\n    cartoon is intended is small children, then what appears to be the case &ndash; \r\n    and Allah knows best &ndash; based on the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, is that there is \r\n    nothing wrong with it. But if the target audience is adults, then this is \r\n    not permissible. Hence what is seen of these cartoons and films is haraam, \r\n    but unfortunately cartoons can be found even on some Islamic channels that \r\n    are aimed at adults. This is not permissible and these are images that are \r\n    haraam, because in fact they clearly come under the heading of competing \r\n    with the creation of Allah, because they are aimed at adults and not \r\n    children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to the cartoons that appear in some \r\n    newspapers and magazines. These drawings also come under the heading of \r\n    haraam images, because they are imitating the creation of Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fiqh an-Nawaazil (Mas&rsquo;alat at-Tasweer)<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <a>\r\n    http:\/\/islamselect.net\/mat\/60661<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9033","question_id":"9033","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For a Muslim to make his \r\n    brother happy and joke with him based on what is true is permissible in \r\n    principle.

It does not impose restrictions on women as some enemies of Islam claim. Islam allows women to work, seek knowledge, engage in business, \r\n    testify in court, uphold the ties of kinship, visit the sick, and so on, but it has set limits regarding her going out in order to protect her and \r\n    to prevent the foolish from harassing her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We say to the questioner:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Many western women, when they think about it \r\n    and come to know the reality of Allaah&rsquo;s laws concerning women, do not hesitate to declare their Islam and enter into the religion of the Prophets \r\n    and the righteous.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In Islam, women are protected and looked \r\n    after. That is not in return for her staying in the home only, rather that is because she plays a great role, which is taking care of her husband \r\n    and raising and caring for children. This is an important role, because the soundness or corruption of society depends on the extent to which \r\n    mothers are successful in their raising and teaching of their children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>One of the largest British insurance \r\n    companies carried out a study on one million housewives, which produced amazing results.

It is stated in \r\n    another study that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>80% of American women think that the freedom \r\n    that women have gained in the last 30 years is the reason for the promiscuity and violence that are prevalent nowadays. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>75% feel worried about the loss of values and \r\n    the disintegration of the family.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>80% have great difficulty in combining their \r\n    responsibilities at work with their responsibilities towards their husbands and children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>87% said that if the clock was turned back \r\n    they would consider the demands for equality as a social conspiracy against the United States and they would resist those who raise the banner of \r\n    equality.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>op. cit., p. 147&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>All it needs is for you to think about the \r\n    matter a little, and look at real life, and you will see that hijab spares women from evil, harm and crimes. Islam has closed the door to such \r\n    evils with its laws, including the requirement for women past the age of puberty to wear hijab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Finally we would like to congratulate you on \r\n    the fact that Allaah has granted you a Muslim husband, so that you will be able to see Islam in practice from him and his Muslim relatives, which \r\n    may encourage you to enter Islam and which may remove the barrier of fear about entering this great and purely monotheistic religion. Also note \r\n    that entering this final religion, which Allaah wants for all people, is a great honour of which you may be deprived if you delay and death then \r\n    overtakes you. So hasten to enter Islam, with submission to the will of Allaah, with eagerness and delighting in this blessing of \r\n    Allaah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You should note that if you fall short in \r\n    your observance of hijab because your human weakness or you feel embarrassed in front of your people, this is regarded as a sin. That should not \r\n    prevent you from doing the great good deed which will lead you to Paradise and save you from Hell, namely embracing Islam. You should also note \r\n    that the Shaytaan (Satan) is the enemy of all the sons of Adam, and he is the one who is stirring up these doubts in order to prevent you from \r\n    entering this religion, so that he can increase the number of those who will follow him to Hell. So be strong and courageous in making the \r\n    decision that will lead to eternal happiness, by Allaah&rsquo;s leave.

Some of the \r\n    scholars mentioned the reason for this prohibition as being that the hair \r\n    and so on prostrate with a person and it is makrooh to roll up the sleeves. \r\n    This was stated in <i>al-Ri&lsquo;aayah<\/i>, for the mentioned reason above. If he \r\n    does that - i.e., tucks up the hair and rolls up his garment and so on, \r\n    because of some work that he was doing before the prayer, it is makrooh for \r\n    him to leave them like that, because of what is stated above, and because of \r\n    the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, according to which he saw &lsquo;Abd-Allah ibn \r\n    al-Haarith praying with his hair braided at the back. He stood up and undid \r\n    his braid. When &lsquo;Abd-Allah had finished praying, he came to Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and \r\n    said: What have you to do with my head? He said: I heard the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: &ldquo;The likeness of such a one \r\n    is that of a person who prays when he is tied up. Narrated by Muslim.

But if that is how he was before he \r\n    prayed, or he did that for the purpose of work, then it is not makrooh for \r\n    him.

That applies if he did that in \r\n    order to pray. But if that is how he dresses or it was for the purpose of \r\n    work, then the time for prayer came and he prayed like that, then it is not \r\n    makrooh for him, as was stated by Ibn Yoonus, because the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I have been commanded to prostrate on \r\n    seven parts and not to tuck up my hair or garment.&rdquo; And he said that the \r\n    prohibition on that only applies if one does that deliberately before \r\n    praying.

It says in <i>al-Mawsoo&lsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (12\/32):\r\n    <i>Tashmeer<\/i> (rolling or tucking up) may mean rolling or tucking up the \r\n    izaar (lower garment or waist wrapper) or thawb (garment). End quote. And \r\n    this is what is referred to here, i.e., tucking up the garment so that the \r\n    calf or shin is uncovered. This is what is mentioned in the hadeeths, as in \r\n    the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (3566): The Messenger of Allah (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) came out and it is as if I [the narrator] \r\n    can see the whiteness of his shins - i.e., because he tucked up his garment \r\n    and they became visible. Hence when al-Bukhaari narrated the hadeeth in a \r\n    chapter entitled Rolling or tucking up the garment, al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the chapter heading: This means \r\n    lifting up the lower part of the garment. Then he said: From this it may be \r\n    understood that the prohibition on tucking up the garment when praying \r\n    applies to something other than the hem of the garment. It is possible that \r\n    this happened coincidently or that it was during a journey, which is the \r\n    situation in which the garment may be rolled up.

Concerning\r\n      what was said about a woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;awrah in front of other women being\r\n      from the navel to the knee, this applies only when she is in her house\r\n      among her sisters and the women of her household. The basic principle is\r\n      still that she should cover all of her body lest she be taken as an\r\n      example and this evil practice become widespread among women. Similarly,\r\n      she must also cover her charms in front of her mahrams and strange women\r\n      lest some of her mahrams be tempted by her or lest some of the women\r\n      describe her to others. It was reported in the hadeeth that the Prophet\r\n      <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No woman should\r\n      describe another woman to her husband so that it is as if he can see\r\n      her.&rdquo; What this means is that if her charms, such as her chest, her\r\n      shoulders, her stomach, her back, her arms, her neck and her calves,\r\n      become visible, whoever sees that will inevitably have an impression of\r\n      her, and usually women talk about what they have seen to their families,\r\n      male and female alike. So a woman may mention that in front of non-mahram\r\n      men [i.e., men who are not mahrams of the woman being described] in a\r\n      manner that may provoke them to pursue her, or which may cause bad people\r\n      to form an attachment to her. For this reason, women have to cover their\r\n      charms &ndash; such as their chests, backs, arms, calves, etc., - even in\r\n      front of mahrams and other women. This covering becomes even more\r\n      essential in parties, leisure facilities, hospitals and schools, even if\r\n      there are only women present, because some non-mahram men and adolescent\r\n      boys may see them or take pictures of them naked which will be a cause of\r\n      temptation to those who see them. A stern warning has been issued to those\r\n      who make a wanton display of themselves and wear see-through or tight\r\n      clothing, when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n      him) said:\r\n      \r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&ldquo;There are two kinds of the people of Hell &hellip; women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait with something on their heads looking like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance.&rdquo; What this means is that they are wearing see-through or tight clothes which show the size of their frame, or there are openings cut in the fabric which show their chests, breasts and other charms. This is widespread in parties and in general gatherings.

Those scholars who \r\n    disallow the niqaab do not do so because it is not prescribed in principle, \r\n    rather it is because some women choose a type of niqaab that does not meet \r\n    the&nbsp; shar&rsquo;i conditions, such as making the opening for the eyes too big. The \r\n    same may also be said of the khimaar. It is not disallowed in and of itself, \r\n    but because of its nature, if the fabric is too thin and the face can be \r\n    seen through it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about the \r\n    Islamic ruling on the niqaab. They replied: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the niqaab, Abu &lsquo;Ubayd said, concerning the definition \r\n    of niqaab among the Arabs: It is that from which the socket of the eye \r\n    appears, and they used to call it al-waswasah or al-burqa&rsquo;. As for the \r\n    ruling concerning it: it is permissible. It was originally mentioned in the \r\n    report narrated by &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    who said: &ldquo;A woman in ihraam should not wear niqaab or gloves.&rdquo; According to \r\n    another report he said: I heard the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) forbid women to wear gloves when in ihraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) forbade the woman in ihraam to wear niqaab indicates that it is \r\n    permissible to wear it when not in ihraam. Moreover it cannot be understood \r\n    from this hadeeth that it is permissible for the woman in ihraam to uncover \r\n    her face if non-mahram men can see her; rather she must lower the khimaar or \r\n    niqaab (over her face) until they have passed her. The basic principle \r\n    concerning that is the report narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood and Ibn \r\n    Majaah from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The riders \r\n    would pass by when we were with the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ihraam. When they drew near to us one of \r\n    us would lower her jilbab from her head over her face, and when they had \r\n    passed by we would uncover (our faces).

If women would stick to the eye opening then we would say that this \r\n    is niqaab, which was known at the time of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and there is nothing wrong with it.

If she does not wear niqaab then \r\n    she is disobeying her Lord, so what benefit will she have from obeying her \r\n    father in that case? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no obedience if it involves \r\n    disobedience towards Allaah; obedience is only in that which is right and \r\n    proper.&rdquo; Narrated by (al-Bukhaari (7257) and Muslim (1840).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You should strive to advise \r\n    your parents and convince them that you are entitled to freedom in choosing \r\n    the opinion which you think is correct, whether it is on the basis of \r\n    knowing the evidence or by following a scholar whom you trust, and according \r\n    to sharee&rsquo;ah it is not permissible for you to ignore this opinion just \r\n    because it goes against the opinion of your father or mother. Not covering \r\n    the face means that you are falling into sin and disobedience, whether you \r\n    do it once or twice or more. Every time you appear before non-mahrams with \r\n    your face uncovered, you are sinning thereby.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Perhaps it seems to you \r\n    from this answer that the issue is not about convincing your parents that \r\n    niqaab is obligatory, because you may or may not succeed, depending on \r\n    whether you present the evidence&nbsp; clearly or nor and whether you are able to \r\n    convince them or not. But the issue that you should focus on is the idea \r\n    that a girl should follow her father&rsquo;s opinion, and it is not permissible \r\n    for her to give up something that she is convinced of because of his \r\n    opinion, and it is not permissible for him to force her to follow his \r\n    opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is an issue concerning \r\n    which there is a difference of scholarly opinion, and the difference \r\n    concerning it is to be respected. In such cases we must be gentle when \r\n    speaking to parents about it, and be patient in dealing with them, and not \r\n    think of them as sinning and disobeying Allaah, or turning away from His \r\n    laws. Perhaps they are convinced that it is not obligatory, just as you are \r\n    convinced that it is obligatory, and because it is their duty to care for \r\n    you and bring you up, they may think that preventing you from doing \r\n    something that is not obligatory is their right.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It seems from your question \r\n    that your parents are not opposed to the principle of covering the face, but \r\n    they think that you are too young for it. This is something that it will be \r\n    easy to convince them about, because if covering the face is obligatory, \r\n    then the girl who has reached adolescence is required to do it, and she is \r\n    sinning by going against it, and it makes no difference whether she is 14 \r\n    years old or 20. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for the problems that \r\n    are expected if you insist on following your opinion and going against your \r\n    parents, these are regular problems which will ease with the passage of time \r\n    and as your parents get used to seeing the niqaab. It needs patience and \r\n    sacrifice, and it is sufficient for the believing woman if her Lord is \r\n    pleased with her, even if people are not pleased.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some fathers are afraid \r\n    that if their daughters start to wear niqaab at a young age, they may be put \r\n    off after that and will take it off. Hence we say: Show how convinced you \r\n    are of the niqaab and how keen you are to wear it and&nbsp; adhere to it, and try \r\n    to dispel their fears. And some of them are afraid that if she puts on \r\n    niqaab, no one will see her properly and that may affect her chances of \r\n    marriage later on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>To sum up: what we advise \r\n    with regard to this problem is to be patient in dealing with your parents \r\n    and seek the intervention of someone who can convince them, if possible. \r\n    Bring them some tapes of scholars who speak of that, and tell them again \r\n    about what has convinced you that it is obligatory, so long as you are sure \r\n    that the source is trusted by your parents. But if you think it most likely \r\n    that the problems with your family caused by your wearing niqaab will be \r\n    more than you can bear, then perhaps you can delay it for a little while \r\n    until they are convinced, or until their objections have died down, but you \r\n    should avoid going out of the house or mixing with non-mahram men as much as \r\n    possible.

How can a Muslim man \r\n    allow himself to hear the command of Allaah and His Messenger then issue \r\n    instructions to the contrary, and tell someone not to do what Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger have enjoined?

But if his fear stems \r\n    from paranoia and worries that are not based on reality, then it is not \r\n    permissible for the girl to obey him by not wearing niqaab in that case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The girl should try to advise her father and convince him \r\n    that she has the freedom to choose the opinion that she believes to be \r\n    correct, whether that is by finding out the evidence for it or by following \r\n    scholars whom she trusts, and it is not permissible for her, according to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, to forsake this opinion because it is not in accordance with her \r\n    father&rsquo;s view. Similarly, it is not permissible for him to make her follow \r\n    his view, and by not allowing her to wear niqaab he is causing her to fall \r\n    into sin and disobedience, whether that is by not wearing it once, twice or \r\n    more. Every time she goes out in front of non-mahrams with her face \r\n    uncovered, she is sinning thereby.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps she can seek the help of people who can convince her \r\n    father about that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps it is clear from this answer that this issue is not \r\n    about convincing her father that wearing niqaab is obligatory. That may or \r\n    may not be achieved, based on how clear the evidence is and the means used \r\n    to convince him. Rather the issue that must be focused on is that the girl \r\n    is not obliged to follow her father&rsquo;s opinion and it is not permissible for \r\n    her to forsake what she is convinced of for the sake of his opinion, and it \r\n    is not permissible for him to make her follow his opinion. There is no point \r\n    in making her fall into sin until she has memorized Soorat al-Baqarah, or \r\n    until he is certain of the sincerity of her intentions, for she is sinning \r\n    every time she goes out without niqaab, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the father understands this, and lets her do what she \r\n    wants, this is what is wanted. If he persists in not allowing her, then the \r\n    basic principle is that she should not obey him, as stated above. But if she \r\n    is afraid that he may become sick because of her going against his wishes, \r\n    then she may uncover her face when she is with him, and cover it when she \r\n    goes out on her own, without telling him about that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to help her and make her steadfast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9065","question_id":"9065","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>A woman is obliged to cover \r\n    her face in front of non-mahram men according to the more correct of the two \r\n    scholarly opinions, because of evidence which has been explained in the \r\n    answer to question no.

When she \r\n    pointed that out to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him), he said: &ldquo;Then a cubit, but no more than that.&rdquo; End quote from <i>\r\n    al-Muntaqa<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan \r\n    (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: Is it mustahabb or waajib for a woman \r\n    to make her dress long? Is wearing socks on the feet sufficient if the dress \r\n    is shortened only so much that nothing of the calf shows? How should a woman \r\n    lengthen her dress by a cubit &ndash; below the ankle or below the knee?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: What is required of the Muslim woman is to cover \r\n    all her body in front of men, hence she is allowed to lengthen her garment \r\n    by a cubit so as to cover her feet, whereas men are forbidden to let their \r\n    garments hang below their ankles. This indicates that women are required to \r\n    cover all of their bodies. If a woman wears socks that is doing something \r\n    extra to be more on the safe side with regard to covering, which is \r\n    something good.

If \r\n    it is done by a kaafir country, there is no sin greater than kufr, but the \r\n    tragedy is that such things are being done by people who call themselves \r\n    Muslims. Equally abhorrent is what some countries do by forcing women to \r\n    have pictures taken without hijab for official documents such as passports \r\n    and ID cards. While we find kaafir countries that allow women to apply for \r\n    official documents with a picture in hijab, at the same time we see some \r\n    so-called Muslim countries refusing to allow that and going to extremes in \r\n    that.

The Muslim woman should call them to Islam in ways that \r\n    are better, by showing the best attitudes promoted in Islam, such as \r\n    speaking and acting kindly, whilst adhering to Islamic rulings such as not \r\n    being the first to greet them and not feeling love towards them in the \r\n    heart.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the way she should dress in front of them, it \r\n    is permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover in front of her mahrams and \r\n    womenfolk as much as is customary among people of religious commitment and \r\n    good manners, such as uncovering the head, neck, forearms and part of the \r\n    calf.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whether the women and mahrams are Muslims or kaafirs, there \r\n    is no difference in the ruling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to wear short \r\n    clothes in front of them, or thin (see-though) clothes, or tight clothes \r\n    that show the shape of the &lsquo;awrah. The scholars of the Standing Committee \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A woman should be modest, even if no one can see her except \r\n    other women, she should not uncover anything more than is customary or needs \r\n    to be uncovered, such as going out in the kind of clothes that she wears \r\n    when doing housework, showing the face, hands and feet and the like. That is \r\n    more concealing and farther removed from any doubt or suspicion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, \r\n    17\/288, 289&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhamamd ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to her \r\n    mahrams what she may uncover is the same as that which she may uncover in \r\n    front of other women, so she may uncover her head, neck, feet, hands, \r\n    forearms and calves, etc. But she should not make her clothes short.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 12\/276, 277&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See the answers to \r\n    questions no, [fatin]12371[\\fatin], \r\n    [fatin]6569[\\fatin] for more quotations and explanations from the \r\n    scholars concerning what a woman may and may not show in front of other \r\n    women and her mahrams.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some scholars differentiate between Muslim women and kaafir \r\n    women, and do not allow taking off the hijab in front of kaafir women. This \r\n    is a less correct view, because Jewish women used to enter upon &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah \r\n    and others among the women of the Sahaabah, and it is not known that they \r\n    wore hijab in front of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is it obligatory to wear hijab in front of kaafir women, or \r\n    can we interact with them as we interact with Muslim women?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are two views among the scholars regarding this matter. \r\n    The more correct view is that it is not obligatory, because no such thing \r\n    was narrated from the wives of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) or from others among the women of the Sahaabah when they \r\n    met with Jewish and idolater women in Madeenah. If that had happened it \r\n    would have been transmitted as less serious matters were transmitted.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And they said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no reason why a woman should not uncover her face in \r\n    front of another woman, whether she is a Muslim or a kaafir, because women \r\n    are only commanded to cover their faces in front of men who are not their \r\n    mahrams. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;&hellip;and to draw their veils \r\n    all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not \r\n    to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or \r\n    their husband&rsquo;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&rsquo;s sons, or their \r\n    brothers or their brother&rsquo;s sons, or their sister&rsquo;s sons, or their women&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:31]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So Allaah commanded them to draw their veils over their faces \r\n    in front of men, except for the mahrams mentioned in this verse, or those \r\n    who are their mahrams because of breastfeeding (radaa&rsquo;ah), as mentioned in \r\n    other verses.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by &ldquo;women&rdquo; in this verse is all women, both \r\n    Muslim and non-Muslim.

Some of them said that what is meant is \r\n    the gender, i.e., all women in general. And some of them said that what is \r\n    meant is the type of women, i.e., believing women only. According to the \r\n    first view, it is permissible for a woman to uncover her hair and face in \r\n    front of non-Muslim women, but according to the second view it is not \r\n    permissible. We are more inclined towards the first view because it is more \r\n    sound, because among women there is no difference between a Muslim woman and \r\n    a non-Muslim woman. This is so long as there is no fitnah (temptation). But \r\n    if there is the fear of fitnah, such as if the woman may describe her (the \r\n    Muslim woman) to her male relatives, then it is essential to take \r\n    precautions in that case, and the woman should not uncover any part of her \r\n    body, such as the feet or hair, in front of the other woman, whether she is \r\n    Muslim or non-Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Mar&rsquo;ah al-Muslimah<\/i> &ndash; \r\n    compiled by Salaah al-Deen Mahmoud, p. 605.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9078","question_id":"9078","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For a woman to wear hijab \r\n    in front of non-mahram men is an obligation that is indicated in the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n    and Sunnah and by scholarly consensus.

That may be achieved by calling on fathers and relatives to \r\n    spend generously on them and to provide some useful work that women can do \r\n    in their homes, so that they will have no need to go out for any reason that \r\n    may lead to them taking off their hijab and exposing them to harm because of \r\n    wearing it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This depends on convincing \r\n    the men that hijaab is obligatory, because many of them do not care about \r\n    that, and some of them are keen for their wives and daughters to go out and \r\n    work, and some of them will not agree to marry a woman who does not work, \r\n    even if her work means that she has to take off the hijaab. This ignorance \r\n    and shortcoming on the part of the men is one of the greatest causes of this \r\n    problem, and one of the reasons why the matter is not being resolved.

And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr \r\n    [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur&rsquo;aan)], that you may explain clearly \r\n    to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nahl 16:44]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Hajar said in <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>: There is a report of \r\n    Ibn Abi Haatim via &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn Khaytham from Safiyyah that \r\n    explains that. This report says: We mentioned the women of Quraysh and their \r\n    virtues in the presence of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah and she said: &ldquo;The women of Quraysh are \r\n    good, but by Allaah I have never seen any better than the women of the \r\n    Ansaar, or any who believed the Book of Allaah more strongly or had more \r\n    faith in the Revelation. When Soorat al-Noor was revealed &ndash; &ldquo;<i>and to draw \r\n    their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and \r\n    bosoms)<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; their menfolk came to them and recited to them what had been \r\n    revealed, and there was not one woman among them who did not go to her \r\n    apron, and the following morning they prayed wrapped up as if there were \r\n    crows on their heads. It was also narrated clearly in the report of \r\n    al-Bukhaari narrated above, where we see &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with her), who was so knowledgeable and pious, praising them in this manner \r\n    and stating that she had never seen any women who believed the Book of \r\n    Allaah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. This clearly \r\n    indicates that they understood from this verse &ndash; &ldquo;<i>and to draw their veils \r\n    all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; \r\n    that it was obligatory to cover their faces and that this stemmed from their \r\n    belief in the Book of Allaah and their faith in the Revelation. It also \r\n    indicates that women&rsquo;s observing hijab in front of men and covering their \r\n    faces is an act of belief in the Book of Allaah and faith in the Revelation. \r\n    It is very strange indeed that some of those who claim to have knowledge say \r\n    that there is nothing in the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah that says that women have to \r\n    cover their faces in front of non-mahram men, even though the Sahaabi women \r\n    did that in obedience to the command of Allaah in His Book, out of faith in \r\n    the Revelation, and that this meaning is also firmly entrenched in the \r\n    Sunnah, as in the report from al-Bukhaari quoted above. This is among the \r\n    strongest evidence that all Muslim women are obliged to observe hijab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Adwa&rsquo; al-Bayaan<\/i>, 6\/594-595.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It was narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah that the wives of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go out at \r\n    night to al-Manaasi&rsquo; (well known places in the direction of al-Baqee&rsquo;) to \r\n    relieve themselves and &lsquo;Umar used to say to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Let your wives be veiled.&rdquo; But the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not \r\n    do that.

What is meant by adornment is the places where adornments are worn: \r\n    the place for a ring is the hand, for a bracelet is the forearm, for an \r\n    earring is the ear, for a necklace is the neck and chest, and for an anklet \r\n    is the leg.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Abu Bakr \r\n    al-Jassaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his <i>Tafseer<\/i>: The \r\n    apparent meaning indicates that it is permissible to show one&rsquo;s adornment to \r\n    one&rsquo;s husband and to whose who are also mentioned in the verse, such as \r\n    fathers etc. It is well known that what is meant is the places where \r\n    adornments are worn, which are the face, hand and arm&hellip; this implies that it \r\n    is permissible for those who are mentioned in the verse to look at these \r\n    places, which are the places where hidden adornments are worn, as it says in \r\n    the beginning of the verse that only outward adornments may be seen by \r\n    strangers (non-mahrams), but the husband and mahrams are permitted to see \r\n    hidden adornments. It was narrated from Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and al-Zubayr that this \r\n    refers to earrings, necklaces, bracelets and anklets.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This applies \r\n    both to the husband and to the others who are mentioned along with him. The \r\n    general meaning implies that it is permissible for those who are mentioned \r\n    to look at the places where these adornments are worn just as it is \r\n    permissible for the husband. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Baghawi \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The words of Allaah, may He be exalted, \r\n    &ldquo;<i>and not to show off their adornment<\/i>&rdquo;, mean that they should not show \r\n    their adornments to a non-mahram. What is meant here is the hidden \r\n    adornments, as there are two kinds of adornment, hidden and apparent. Hidden \r\n    adornments include anklets, henna on the foot, bracelets on the wrist, \r\n    earrings and necklaces. It is not permissible for a woman to show these, or \r\n    for a stranger (non-mahram) to look at them. And what is meant by adornment \r\n    is the place where the adornment is worn. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in\r\n    <i>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo;<\/i> (5\/11):&nbsp; A man may also look at the face, neck, \r\n    hand, foot, head and calf of a woman who is his mahram. According to this \r\n    report al-Qaadi said: It is permissible (to look at) that which ordinarily \r\n    appears such as the head and hands up to the elbows. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>These \r\n    mahrams differ in the degree of closeness and risk of fitnah (temptation). \r\n    Hence a woman may show to her father what she may not show to her husband&rsquo;s \r\n    son. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Allaah mentioned \r\n    husbands first, then He mentioned mahrams, and described them all as equal \r\n    with regard to showing the adornment. But they may differ according to what \r\n    is in their hearts. There is no doubt that for a woman to uncover in front \r\n    of her father or brother is more safe than to uncover in front of her \r\n    husband&rsquo;s son. The extent of what she may show may differ, so she may show \r\n    to her father that which it is not permissible for her to show to her \r\n    husband&rsquo;s son.

It is not permissible for a woman to \r\n    look at the area between the navel and the knee of another woman, except in \r\n    cases of necessity such as medical treatment and the like.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This does \r\n    not mean that a woman may sit among other women with all of her body \r\n    uncovered except the area between the navel and the knee. No one does that \r\n    except women who are promiscuous and negiligent, or immoral and evildoers. \r\n    The words of the scholars, &ldquo;The &lsquo;awrah is the area between the navel and the \r\n    knee&rdquo; should not be misunderstood, because this does not mean that this is \r\n    how women should always dress and show themselves among their sisters and \r\n    friends. No wise person would accept that and it is not what the fitrah \r\n    (sound human nature) calls for.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Rather the \r\n    way a woman should dress among other women is in clothes that cover properly \r\n    and express her modesty and dignity. She should not show anything except \r\n    that which appears when she is working and serving others, such as the head, \r\n    neck, forearms and feet, as we have mentioned when discussing mahrams \r\n    above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Standing \r\n    Committee for Issuing Fatwas has explained what a woman is not permitted to \r\n    uncover in front of her mahrams and other women.

Women \r\n    at that time used to wear concealing garments, and it is not known that they used to uncover themselves when they met one another or when they met \r\n    their mahrams. The women of this ummah followed this mode of behaviour &ndash; praise be to Allaah &ndash; generation after generation until recently, when \r\n    corruption and impropriety entered the way women dress and behave for many reasons, which we do not have room to discuss here.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Because of the large number of questions that \r\n    have been sent to the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas about women looking at women, and what women should wear, the \r\n    Committee is telling all Muslim women that women are obliged to have an attitude of modesty, which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) described as being part of faith and one of the branches of faith. One aspect of the modesty which is enjoined by Islam and by custom \r\n    is that women should cover themselves, be modest and adopt an attitude and conduct that will keep her far away from falling into fitnah \r\n    (temptation) and doubtful situations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>The Qur&rsquo;aan clearly indicates that a woman \r\n    should not show to other women anything other than that which she shows to her mahrams, that which she customarily uncovers in her own home and \r\n    when doing housework, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/u><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i><u>&ldquo;&hellip;and not to reveal their adornment \r\n    except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&rsquo;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&rsquo;s sons, or their brothers or their \r\n    brother&rsquo;s sons, or their sister&rsquo;s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam)&hellip;&rdquo;<\/u><\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i><u>[al-Noor 24:31]<\/u><\/i><u><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/u><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>If this is the text of the Qur&rsquo;aan and this is what is indicated by the Sunnah, then this is \r\n    what the wives of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah used to do, and the women of the \r\n    ummah who followed them in truth until the present day.<\/u> <u>What was usually uncovered in front of \r\n    the people mentioned in this verse is what women usually uncover when they are at home and when doing housework, which is difficult to avoid, such \r\n    as uncovering the head, hands, neck and feet. <\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to going to extremes in uncovering, there is no evidence in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah \r\n    that this is permissible. This is also the way that leads to a woman tempting or being tempted by other women, which happens among them. It also \r\n    sets a bad example to other women, as well as being an imitation of kaafir women, prostitutes and immoral women in the way they dress. It was \r\n    proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever imitates a people is one of them.&rdquo; Narrated by Imam Ahmad \r\n    and Abu Dawood. In <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> (2077) it is narrated from &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) saw him wearing two garments dyed with safflower, and he said, &ldquo;These are from the clothing of the kuffaar &ndash; do not wear them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is also narrated in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> \r\n    (2128) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: \r\n    people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, misguided and leading others \r\n    astray, with their heads like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its \r\n    fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The meaning of the phrase &ldquo;clothed yet naked&rdquo; \r\n    is that the woman is wearing clothes that do not cover her, so she is clothed, but in fact she is naked, such as when she wears a thin dress that \r\n    shows the colour of her skin, or a dress that shows the outline of her body, or a short dress that does not cover part of her limbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So what Muslim women have to do is to adhere \r\n    to the guidance followed by the Mothers of the Believers (the Prophet&rsquo;s wives) and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    them), and the women of this ummah who followed them in truth, and strive to cover themselves and be modest. This is farthest removed from the \r\n    causes of fitnah and will protect them from the things that lead to provocation of desires and falling into immorality.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Muslim women must also beware of falling into \r\n    that which Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden of imitating kaafir women and prostitutes, in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, and in the \r\n    hope of attaining the reward of Allaah, and for fear of His punishment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Every Muslim must also fear Allaah with \r\n    regard to the women who are under his care, and not let them wear things that Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden, such as provocative \r\n    clothes, or clothes that are revealing or tempting.

You have an example of that in the righteous believing women such \r\n    as Umm al-Mu&rsquo;mineen (the Mother of the Believers) Khadeejah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with her), who played a great role in making the heart of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) remain firm and \r\n    steadfast when his mission began.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;and not to reveal their adornment except \r\n    to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&rsquo;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&rsquo;s sons, or their brothers or their brother&rsquo;s \r\n    sons, or their sister&rsquo;s sons, or their women &hellip;&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Noor 24:31]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some scholars said that &ldquo;<i>their women<\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    means believing women; if the women are kaafirs then the believing woman should not reveal her adornment to them.

Based on this, the woman&rsquo;s abayah must meet the \r\n    following conditions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; It must be made of thick material that does not show what \r\n    is underneath, and it should not cling to the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It should cover the entire body, and be loose enough so \r\n    that it does not show the shape. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; It should be open from the front only, and the sleeve \r\n    openings should be narrow.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; It should not have any adornment that attracts attention, \r\n    so it must be free of designs, decorations, writing and symbols.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; It should not resemble the dress of kaafir women, or \r\n    men.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; The &lsquo;abayah should come down from the top of the head.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, the kind of abayah mentioned in the \r\n    question is not the kind of abayah that is prescribed for women in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, so it is not permissible to wear it, because it does not meet the \r\n    necessary conditions. It is also not permissible to wear any other kind of \r\n    &lsquo;abayah that does not meet the necessary conditions, or to import them, \r\n    manufacture them, sell them or distribute them among the Muslims, because \r\n    this is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression, and Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;but do not help one another in sin and transgression.

All of this was covered \r\n          when they were inside the house, and when they went out to the market, \r\n          it was known that the women of the Sahaabah used to wear loose garments \r\n          which would drag along the ground. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed them to let it trail \r\n          up to a cubit, but no more than that.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>With regards to the doubts that some women have, concerning the words \r\n          of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n          of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Let no woman look at the &lsquo;awrah of another \r\n          woman and let no man look at the &lsquo;awrah of another man; the &lsquo;awrah of \r\n          a woman in front of another woman is from the navel to the knee&rdquo;, which \r\n          they interpret as indicating that women may wear short clothes &ndash; the \r\n          Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n          Allaah be upon him) did not say that&nbsp; it is sufficient for women&rsquo;s \r\n          clothing to cover the area from the navel to the knee, so this cannot \r\n          be used as evidence. What he did say was that no woman should look at \r\n          the &lsquo;awrah of another woman, so he forbade them to look, because the \r\n          &lsquo;awrah of the woman who is wearing loose clothing may sometimes be exposed \r\n          when answering the call of nature or for some other reason, so the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) forbade women to look at one another&rsquo;s &lsquo;awrahs.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that no man should look at the \r\n          &lsquo;awrah of another man, does this means that the Sahaabah wore izaars \r\n          (waist wrappers) or trousers only between the navel and the knee? Does \r\n          anyone think that women can go to meet other women wearing nothing but \r\n          clothes that cover her from the navel to the knee? No one would say \r\n          such a thing. That only happens among the kaafir women. The confusion \r\n          that some women feel has no basis; what some women understand from this \r\n          hadeeth is not correct. The meaning of the hadeeth is clear. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) did not say that women's clothing should cover only the \r\n          area between the navel and the knee. Women have to fear Allaah and feel \r\n          that sense of modesty which is part of the nature of women and which \r\n          is part of faith, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Modesty is a branch \r\n          of faith.&rdquo; And it is said in the proverbial sense, &ldquo;more shy than the \r\n          virgin in her seclusion.&rdquo; It was not even known among the women of the \r\n          jaahiliyyah to cover only the area from the navel to the knee, such \r\n          a thing was not known among either women or men; do these women want \r\n          the Muslim women to be even worse in appearance than the women of the \r\n          jaahiliyyah?&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>In conclusion: the clothing is one thing and looking at \r\n          the &lsquo;awrah is another thing. With regard to clothing and what a woman \r\n          wears in front of other women, it is prescribed for her to cover everything \r\n          from the palm of the hand to the heel of the foot, but if a woman needs \r\n          to pull up her dress in order to do some work etc., she may pull it \r\n          up to her knees, and if she needs to roll up her sleeves to the upper \r\n          arms she may do that too, if she only does it as much as is necessary. \r\n          But if this is the way she usually dresses, then that is not allowed. \r\n          The hadeeth does not indicate this under any circumstances at all, hence \r\n          it addresses the one who is looking, not the one who is looked at. The \r\n          Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n          Allaah be upon him) was not referring to how women should dress; all \r\n          he was referring to was the &lsquo;awrah.

No rational person would doubt that one of the means of doing so is covering the face, because uncovering it causes \r\n    people to look at it and enjoy its beauty, and thence to initiate contact. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;The eyes commit zina and their zina is by looking&hellip;&rdquo; then he said, &ldquo;&hellip; and the private part confirms that or denies it.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, \r\n    6612; Muslim, 2657.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If covering the face is one of the means of \r\n    guarding one&rsquo;s chastity, then it is enjoined, because the means come under the same ruling as the ends.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;&hellip;<\/span><i>and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. \r\n    their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) <\/i>&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;. The <i>jayb<\/i> (pl. <i>juyoob<\/i>) is the neck opening of a garment and the <i>khimaar<\/i> (veil) \r\n    is that with which a woman covers her head. If a woman is commanded to draw her veil over the neck opening of her garment then she is commanded to \r\n    cover her face, either because that is implied or by analogy. If it is obligatory to cover the throat and chest, then it is more appropriate to \r\n    cover the face because it is the site of beauty and attraction.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Allaah has forbidden showing all adornment except that which is apparent, which is that which one cannot help showing, such as the \r\n    outside of one's garment. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;&hellip;<\/span><i>except only that which is apparent<\/i> \r\n    &hellip;&rdquo; and He did not say, except that which they show of it. Some of the salaf, such as Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, al-Hasan, Ibn Sireen and others interpreted the \r\n    phrase &ldquo;<i>except only that which is apparent<\/i>&rdquo; as meaning the outer garment and clothes, and what shows from beneath the outer garment (i.e., \r\n    the hem of one&rsquo;s dress etc.). Then He again forbids showing one&rsquo;s adornment except to those for whom He makes an exception. This indicates that \r\n    the second adornment mentioned is something other than the first adornment. The first adornment is the external adornment which appears to \r\n    everyone and cannot be hidden. The second adornment is the inward adornment (including the face). If it were permissible for this adornment to be \r\n    seen by everyone, there would be no point to the general wording in the first instance and this exception made in the second.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Allaah grants a concession allowing a woman to show her inward adornments to &ldquo;<i>old male servants who lack vigour<\/i>&rdquo;, i.e. \r\n    servants who are men who have no desire, and to small children who have not reached the age of desire and have not seen the &lsquo;awrahs of women. This \r\n    indicates two things:<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; That showing inward \r\n    adornments to non-mahrams is not permissible except to these two types of people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; That the reason for \r\n    this ruling is the fear that men may be tempted by the woman and fall in love with her. Undoubtedly the face is the site of beauty and attraction, \r\n    so concealing it is obligatory lest men who do feel desire be attracted and tempted by her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    The words (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;<\/span><i>And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what \r\n    they hide of their adornment<\/i>&rdquo; mean that a woman should not stamp her feet so as to make known hidden adornments such as anklets and the like. \r\n    If a woman is forbidden to stamp her feet lest men be tempted by what they hear of the sound of her anklets etc., then what about uncovering the \r\n    face?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Which is the greater source of temptation &ndash; a \r\n    man hearing the anklets of a woman whom he does not know who she is or whether she is beautiful, or whether she is young or old, or ugly or \r\n    pretty? Or his looking at a beautiful youthful face that attracts him and invites him to look at it?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Every man who has any desire for women will \r\n    know which of the two temptations is greater and which deserves to be hidden and concealed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(ii)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And as for women past childbearing who do \r\n    not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. \r\n    not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allaah is All&#8209;Hearer, All&#8209;Knower&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Noor 24:60]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The evidence from this verse is that Allaah \r\n    states that there is no sin on old women who have no hope of marriage because men have no desire for them, due to their old age (if they discard \r\n    their outer clothing), subject to the condition that their intention in doing so is not to make a wanton display of themselves. The fact that this \r\n    ruling applies only to old women indicates that the ruling is different for young women who still hope to get married. If the ruling on discarding \r\n    the outer clothing applied to all, there would be no point in singling out old women here.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The phrase &ldquo;<i>in such a way as not to show \r\n    their adornment<\/i>&rdquo; offers further proof that hijab is obligatory for young women who hope to marry, because usually when they uncover their \r\n    faces the intention is to make a wanton display (tabarruj) and to show off their beauty and make men look at them and admire them etc. Those who \r\n    do otherwise are rare, and the ruling does not apply to rare cases. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iii)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;O Prophet!

This indicates that the one who is not proposing marriage is sinning if he looks at a non-mahram \r\n    woman in ordinary circumstances, as is the one who is proposing marriage if he looks for any purpose other than proposing marriage, such as for \r\n    the purpose of enjoyment etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If it is said that the hadeeth does not \r\n    clearly state what is being looked at, and it may mean looking at the chest etc, the response is that the man who is proposing marriage looks at \r\n    the face because it is the focus for the one who is seeking beauty, without a doubt.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(ii)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) commanded that women should be brought out to the Eid prayer place, they said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, some of us do not have \r\n    jilbaabs.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Let her sister give her one of her jilbaabs to wear.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari and Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This hadeeth indicates that the usual \r\n    practice among the women of the Sahaabah was that a woman would not go out without a jilbaab, and that if she did not have a jilbaab she would not \r\n    go out. The command to wear a jilbaab indicates that it is essential to cover.

This \r\n    was during the best generations, so what about nowadays?!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(iv) &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever lets his garment drag out of pride, Allaah will not look at \r\n    him on the Day of Resurrection.&rdquo; Umm Salamah said, &ldquo;What should women do with their hems?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Let it hang down a handspan.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;What \r\n    if that shows her feet?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Let it hang down a cubit, but no more than that.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\r\n    <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This hadeeth indicates that it is obligatory for women to cover their feet, and that this was \r\n    something that was well known among the women of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). The feet are undoubtedly a lesser source of \r\n    temptation than the face and hands, so a warning concerning something that is less serious is a warning about something that is more serious and \r\n    to which the ruling applies more. The wisdom of sharee&rsquo;ah means that it would not enjoin covering something that is a lesser source of temptation \r\n    and allow uncovering something that is a greater source of temptation. This is an impossible contradiction that cannot be attributed to the wisdom \r\n    and laws of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(v)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said: The \r\n    riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ihraam. When they came \r\n    near us we would lower our jilbaabs from our heads over our faces, and when they had passed by we would uncover our faces. Narrated by Abu Dawood, \r\n    1562.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;The words &ldquo;When they came near us we would \r\n    lower our jilbaabs from our heads over our faces&rdquo; indicate that it is obligatory to cover the face, because what is prescribed in ihraam is to \r\n    uncover it. If there was no strong reason to prevent uncovering it, it would be obligatory to leave it uncovered even when the riders were passing \r\n    by. In other words, women are obliged to uncover their faces during ihraam according to the majority of scholars, and nothing can override \r\n    something that is obligatory except something else that is also obligatory. If it were not obligatory to observe hijab and cover the face in the \r\n    presence of non-mahram men, there would be no reason not to uncover it in ihraam. It was proven in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> and elsewhere that a woman \r\n    in ihraam is forbidden to wear the niqaab (face veil) and gloves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: This is \r\n    one of the things which indicate that the niqaab and gloves were known among women who were not in ihraam, which implies that they covered their \r\n    faces and hands.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>These are nine points of evidence from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/u><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>The tenth is:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Rational examination and analogy which form the basis of this perfect sharee&rsquo;ah, which aims to \r\n    help people achieve what is in their best interests and encourages the means that lead to that, and to denounce evil and block the means that lead \r\n    to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If we think about unveiling and women showing \r\n    their faces to non-mahram men, we will see that it involves many bad consequences. Even if we assume that there are some benefits in it, they are \r\n    very few in comparison with its negative consequences. Those negative consequences include:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Fitnah (temptation). By unveiling her \r\n    face, a woman may be tempted to do things to make her face look more beautiful. This is one of the greatest causes of evil and corruption.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; Taking away haya&rsquo; (modesty, shyness) from \r\n    women, which is part of faith and of a woman&rsquo;s nature (fitrah). Women are examples of modesty, as it was said, &ldquo;more shy than a virgin in her \r\n    seclusion.&rdquo; Taking away a woman&rsquo;s modesty detracts from her faith and the natural inclination with which she was created.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Men may be tempted by her, especially if \r\n    she is beautiful and she flirts, laughs and jokes, as happens in the case of many of those who are unveiled. The Shaytaan flows through the son of \r\n    Adam like blood.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; Mixing of men and women. If a woman \r\n    thinks that she is equal with men in uncovering her face and going around unveiled, she will not be modest and will not feel too shy to mix with \r\n    men. This leads to a great deal of fitnah (temptation) and widespread corruption.

It is not \r\n    permissible for the wife of one brother to uncover her face in front of his \r\n    brother, because his brother is like any other man in the street with regard \r\n    to looking and being non-mahram.

So the wife \r\n    will be in a separate part of the house, and the brother will be in another \r\n    separate part of the house.

When the woman saw that he had not\r\n        made any decision, she sat down. Then a man from among his Companions stood up and said,\r\n        &lsquo;O Messenger of Allaah, if you don&rsquo;t want to marry her, then marry her to\r\n        me.&rsquo; &hellip;&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7\/19; Muslim, 4\/143;\r\n        al-Nisaa&rsquo;i bi Sharh al-Suyooti, 6\/113; al-Bayhaqi, 7\/84).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      \r\n      <li><p>Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;I was with the\r\n        Prophet <img>\r\n, and a man came to him and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar.\r\n        The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &lsquo;Have you\r\n        looked at her?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Go and look at her, for there\r\n        is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Reported by Ahmad, 2\/286, 299;\r\n        Muslim, 4\/142; al-Nisaa&rsquo;i, 2\/73).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      \r\n      <li><p>Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of\r\n        Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When any one of you\r\n        proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead\r\n        and marry her, let him do so.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Haakim.

The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No man is alone with a [non-mahram] woman but the Shaytaan\r\n    is the third one present with them.&rdquo; He should not look at her in a lustful or\r\n    suspicious manner.

It was reported that\r\n    Ahmad said this was makrooh in the case of a young woman, but not in the case of an old\r\n    woman, and in the case where there is fear of fitnah, or where there is no need for this\r\n    business deal. But in cases where it is necessary, and there is no wrongful desire, then\r\n    there is no harm in it.&rdquo; (<i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 7\/459; <i>al-Sharh al-Kabeer<\/i> <i>&lsquo;ala\r\n    Matan al-Muqni&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/348 <i>bi Haamish al-Mughni<\/i>; <i>al-Hidaayah ma&rsquo;a\r\n    Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer<\/i>, 10\/24).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Dasooqi said: &ldquo; When testimony is given\r\n    concerning a woman who wears niqaab (face-veil), she has to remove her niqaab. This\r\n    applies in the case of marriage and other matters, such as selling, giving gifts, debts,\r\n    power of attorney, and so on.

It is less\r\n    serious for her to be seen by a doctor of the same sex, and she should not be seen by a\r\n    non-Muslim doctor if a Muslim doctor is available. Also, she should not uncover more than\r\n    the site of the problem.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not permissible for the doctor to look at or touch more than is\r\n    necessary, because the issue is one of necessity and should not be exaggerated.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said: &ldquo;it is permissible for the doctor to look at\r\n    whatever is necessary of her body, of her private parts and elsewhere, because there is a\r\n    need for it to be uncovered.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was reported that a boy who had stolen something was brought to\r\n    &lsquo;Uthmaan. He said, &lsquo;Look at his groin (to see if he had pubic hair, which would\r\n    indicate whether he had reached the age of puberty [and would therefore be considered to\r\n    be a responsible adult] or not).&rsquo; They did not find any pubic hair, so they did not\r\n    cut off his hand.&rdquo; (<i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 7\/459; <i>Ghidha&rsquo; al-Albaab<\/i>,\r\n    1\/97).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn &lsquo;Aabideen said: &ldquo;He said in <i>al-Jawharah<\/i>:\r\n    if the illness is in any part of her body apart from her private part, it is permitted\r\n    (for the doctor) to look at it in order to treat it, because it is the matter of\r\n    necessity. If the sickness is in her private part, he (the doctor) should teach a woman\r\n    how to treat it. If there is nobody who can do that, and they fear that she may die or\r\n    suffer unbearably, then they should cover all of her body except the site of the sickness,\r\n    then a man may treat her, but he should avoid looking at her as much as he can, and look\r\n    only at the site of the sickness that he is treating.&rdquo; (<i>Radd al-Muhtaar<\/i>,\r\n    5\/237. See also, <i>al-Hidaayah al-&lsquo;Alaa&rsquo;iyah<\/i>, p. 245).<\/p>\r\n    <p>A similar ruling applies to one who is taking care of a\r\n    sick person, even if it is someone of the opposite sex, when helping the patient with\r\n    wudoo&rsquo; or istinja&rsquo; (washing the private parts after using the toilet). (See\r\n    <i>Ghidha&rsquo; al-Albaab<\/i>, 1\/97).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Muhammad Fu&rsquo;aad said: &ldquo;What indicates that it\r\n    is permissible for a man to treat a woman &ndash; within the restrictions mentioned above\r\n    &ndash; is the report narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari with his isnaad from al-Rabee&rsquo;\r\n    bint Mu&rsquo;awwadh, who said: &ldquo;We used to go out on military campaigns with the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

The\r\n    ruling is that it is permissible for women to treat non-mahram men in cases of necessity,\r\n    with as little looking and touching as possible.&rdquo; (<i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>,\r\n    10\/136)<\/p>\r\n    <p>IV &ndash; Testimony<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face when she is giving\r\n    testimony in court, whether she is a witness in a case or is there to witness a deal, and\r\n    it is permissible for the qaadi (judge) to look at her in order to know who she is and to\r\n    protect the rights of all concerned.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Dardeer said: &ldquo;It is not permitted to give testimony\r\n    against a woman in niqaab until she uncovers her face so that it may be known who she is\r\n    and what she looks like.&rdquo; (<i>Al-Sharh al-Kabeer li&rsquo;l- Shaykh al-Dardeer<\/i>,\r\n    4\/194)<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said: &ldquo;The witness may look at the\r\n    face of the woman against whom he is testifying so that his testimony will speak about her\r\n    in specific terms. Ahmad said: &lsquo;He cannot testify against a woman unless he knows who\r\n    she is.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 7\/459; <i>al-Sharh al-Kabeer &lsquo;ala Matan\r\n    al-Muqni&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/348, <i>bi haamish al-Mughni<\/i>; <i>al-Hidaayah ma&rsquo;a Takmilat\r\n    Fath al-Qadeer<\/i>, 10\/26).<\/p>\r\n    <p>V &ndash; In court cases<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of a qaadi\r\n    (judge) who is to rule either in her favour or against her, and in this situation he may\r\n    look at her face in order to know who she is and for the sake of protecting people&rsquo;s\r\n    rights.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The same rules that apply to giving testimony or bearing witness also\r\n    apply in court cases, because they serve the same purpose.

Ibn Qudaamah said: &ldquo;Whoever no longer feels any\r\n    desire, because of old age, impotence or incurable illness, or because he is a eunuch,\r\n    &hellip; or a mukhannath (the effeminate man or a man who has female hormones) who feels no\r\n    desire, the ruling that applies to such a man is the same as the ruling that applies to\r\n    mahrams regarding looking at women, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&lsquo;&hellip;\r\n    or old male servants who lack vigour&hellip;&rsquo; [al-Noor 24:31]<\/i>, i.e., those who feel\r\n    no desire for women.&rdquo; Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: &ldquo;This is the one of whom women do\r\n    not feel shy.&rdquo; He also said: &ldquo;This is the mukhannath who is impotent (i.e.,\r\n    cannot have an erection).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was reported that Mujaahid and Qutaadah said: &ldquo;This is the one\r\n    who has no interest in women, but if he is a mukhannath who feels desire and knows about\r\n    women, then the rules that apply to others apply also to him, because &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah\r\n    said: &lsquo;A mukhannath entered upon the wives of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him), and they used to think that he was a man who felt no physical\r\n    desires, but the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon us when\r\n    this man was describing a woman and saying &lsquo;When she comes in, she comes on four, and\r\n    when she goes out, she goes on eight.&rsquo; The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) said: &lsquo;Do I not see that this man knows who is here?

The mukhannath is the one who looks so much like a woman\r\n    physically that he resembles women in his softness, speech, appearance, accent and\r\n    thinking. If he is like this, he would have no desire for women and he would not notice\r\n    anything about them. This is one of those who have no interest in women who were permitted\r\n    to enter upon women. Do you not see that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) did not prevent that mukhannath from entering upon his wives at first, but when\r\n    he heard him describing the daughter of Ghaylaan and realized that he knew about women, he\r\n    commanded that he should be kept away.&rdquo; (<i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 7\/463; <i>al-Sharh\r\n    al-Kabeer &lsquo;ala Matan al-Muqni&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/347-348).<\/p>\r\n    <p>IX &ndash; Old women who are past marriageable age<\/p>\r\n    <p>Old women who are past marriageable age may uncover their faces and\r\n    what usually appears in front of non-mahram men, but it is still better for them to remain\r\n    covered.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And as for women\r\n    past child-bearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their\r\n    (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment.

Ibn\r\n    Qudaamah said: &ldquo;In the case of old women who are past marriageable age, there is\r\n    nothing wrong if they show what ordinarily appears, because Allaah says (interpretation of\r\n    the meaning), <i>&lsquo;And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect\r\n    wedlock&hellip;&rsquo; [al-Noor 24:60].<\/i>&rdquo; Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said concerning the aayahs\r\n    (interpretation of the meanings), <i>&ldquo;Tell the believing men to lower their\r\n    gaze&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Noor 24:30]<\/i> and <i>&ldquo;Tell the believing women to lower their\r\n    gaze&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Noor 24:31]<\/i>: &ldquo;Old women who no longer expect to get married\r\n    were exempted from this.

There is no difference between\r\n    Muslims, and no difference between a Muslim woman and a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under\r\n    Muslim rule) woman, just as there is no difference between two Muslim men or between a\r\n    Muslim man and a dhimmi man when it comes to seeing. Ahmad said: &lsquo;Some people think\r\n    that she should not take off her head covering in front of a Jewish or Christian woman.\r\n    However, I think that she (a Jewish or Christian woman) should not see the private part\r\n    (of a Muslim woman), or attend her when she gives birth (i.e., she should not be her\r\n    midwife, because she will look at the most private part of her body when she gives birth\r\n    &ndash; except in cases of necessity, as discussed above).&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Another opinion was reported from Ahmad, according to which a Muslim\r\n    woman should not remove her niqaab in front of a dhimmi woman, because Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;&hellip; or their women &hellip;&rdquo; [al-Noor\r\n    24:31].<\/i> But the first opinion is more correct, because kaafir women, Jewish and\r\n    others, used to enter upon the wives of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him), and they did not wear hijaab in front of them nor were they commanded to do so.\r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said that a Jewish woman used to come and talk to her, saying\r\n    &ldquo;May Allaah save you from the punishment of the grave,&rdquo; and she\r\n    [&lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah] asked the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him)&hellip; Asma&rsquo; said, &ldquo;My mother came to me, and she had no desire to\r\n    become Muslim. I asked the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him), &lsquo;Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?&rsquo; and he said,\r\n    &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, hijaab between men and women serves a purpose that is not an\r\n    issue in the case of a Muslim woman and a dhimmi woman, just as it is not an issue in the\r\n    case of a Muslim man and a dhimmi man. Hijaab is obligatory when there is a text stating\r\n    that it is so or the obligation may be understood by analogy; in the case of a Muslim\r\n    woman and a non-Muslim woman, there is neither text nor analogy.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The aayah <i>&ldquo;&hellip; or their women &hellip;&rdquo; [al-Noor 24:31]<\/i>\r\n    could refer to all women. (<i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 7\/464; <i>al-Sharh al-Kabeer &lsquo;ala\r\n    Matan al-Muqni&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/351 <i>bi haamish al-Mughni<\/i>).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi al-Maaliki said: &ldquo;The correct\r\n    view, in my opinion, is that this permissible in the case of all women, and that it\r\n    appears with the pronoun ( <i>-hinna<\/i> = their) to match the rest of the aayah. This is\r\n    the aayah of pronouns, where the pronoun <i>-hinna<\/i> appears twenty-five times; there is\r\n    nothing else like it in the Qur&rsquo;aan. So this word matches the others.&rdquo; (<i>Ahkaam\r\n    al-Qur&rsquo;aan<\/i>, 3\/326).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Aloosi said: &ldquo;Al-Fakhr al-Raazi suggested that\r\n    the dhimmi woman is like the Muslim woman, and he said: &ldquo;The correct opinion is that\r\n    she (the dhimmi woman) is like the Muslim woman, and<i> &lsquo;their women&rsquo;<\/i> means\r\n    all women. The opinion of the salaf (early generations of Islam) should be understood on\r\n    the basis that (covering in front of non-Muslim women) is preferable, but it is not\r\n    obligatory.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;This view is easier for people today, for Muslim\r\n    woman can hardly observe hijaab in front of dhimmi women.&rdquo; (<i>Tafseer\r\n    al-Aloosi<\/i>, 19\/143).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Muhammad Fu&rsquo;aad said: &ldquo;If this opinion was\r\n    easier in their time, then no doubt it is more appropriate and easier in our own time,\r\n    especially for those women who, because of circumstances beyond their control, find that\r\n    they have to live in non-Muslim countries, where they mix with non-Muslim women and their\r\n    lives are interwoven with theirs, to the extent that observing hijaab in front of them is\r\n    fraught with difficulties. Truly, to Allaah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall\r\n    return.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>XI &ndash; Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah<\/p>\r\n    <p>Women must uncover their faces and hands when they enter ihraam for\r\n    Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah. At this time, they are forbidden to wear niqaab and gloves, because\r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The woman\r\n    who is in ihraam must not wear niqaab or gloves.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a woman needs to cover her face because men are passing close by\r\n    her, or she is beautiful and is sure that men are looking at her, she should drop a part\r\n    of head covering over her face, because of the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah in which she\r\n    said, &ldquo;Riders were passing by us, and we were in ihraam with the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when they came near, each of us would\r\n    lower her jilbaab over her face, and when they went away we would uncover our faces\r\n    again.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Juzayri said, reporting from them: &ldquo;A woman may cover her face\r\n    for a necessary reason, such as non-mahram men passing close by her, and the fact that\r\n    (the cloth) will touch her face does not matter. This is to make it easy and alleviate\r\n    hardship.&rdquo; (<i>Al-Fiqh &lsquo;ala&rsquo;l-Madhaahib al-Arba&rsquo;ah<\/i>, 1\/645).<\/p>\r\n    <p>These are situations in which it is acceptable for a\r\n    woman to uncover her face and hands, explained in detail by the fuqaha&rsquo; and scholars.\r\n    But there is one other situation which deserves our attention, and that is when a Muslim\r\n    woman is forced to uncover her face &ndash; what is the ruling in this case?<\/p>\r\n    <p>XII &ndash; Compulsion<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some oppressive regimes have instituted harsh laws which go against the\r\n    religion of Islam and rebel against Allaah and His Messenger. These laws prevent Muslim\r\n    women from wearing proper hijaab, and some of them even remove their niqaab by force and\r\n    subject them to the worst type of oppression and persecution.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Women who wear niqaab have been subjected to harassment in certain\r\n    European countries, where they have been subjected to harm, and Islam and the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have been slandered. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Therefore, when a woman is certain that she is likely to be subjected\r\n    to unbearable harassment, she is permitted to uncover her face. It is better to follow a\r\n    scholarly opinion which is less correct than to expose herself to trouble at the hands of\r\n    evil men.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a woman is permitted to uncover her face and hands in the situations\r\n    described above, which do not involve force or harassment, then surely it is more likely\r\n    that she is permitted to uncover them when she is faced with a threat to herself and her\r\n    religion, especially when her niqaab may expose her to tormentors who may pull the hijaab\r\n    from her head or subject her to worse abuse. In cases of necessity, things that are\r\n    ordinarily forbidden are permitted, within the limits of what is strictly necessary, as\r\n    the scholars have stated, but this should not lead one to take the matter of covering the\r\n    face lightly. Each woman must evaluate the situation in which she is living and learn from\r\n    her own experience and that of others, so that she will be sure of what is a case of real\r\n    necessity, as opposed to her own whims and weaknesses.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Although women are permitted to uncover their faces and hands in the\r\n    exceptional situations described above, they are not permitted to wear make-up and visible\r\n    jewellery if they do so. It is forbidden for them to display these things in front of\r\n    non-mahram men, according to all the fuqaha&rsquo;, because Allaah says (interpretation of\r\n    the meaning<i>): &ldquo;&hellip; and not to show off their adornment&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Noor\r\n    24:31]<\/i>, and because there is no need to do so.

He <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    said: &ldquo;Beware of entering upon women.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah,\r\n    what do you think about the brother-in-law?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;The brother in law is\r\n    death.&rdquo; I.e., many people have a relaxed attitude towards the brother-in-law entering\r\n    upon women, until some disaster happens as a result, that they never thought would happen\r\n    because they trusted their brother-in-law!

This sinful Muslim will be \r\n          subject to the will of Allaah in the Hereafter; if He wills He will \r\n          punish him, and if He wills He will forgive him. If he enters Hell in \r\n          the hereafter, he will not abide there forever. But no person can be \r\n          certain as to his fate, as to whether the punishment will befall him \r\n          or not, because this matter is known only to Allaah. &nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>Sins are divided into two categories, minor \r\n          and major.

Major sins (which are those concerning which a specific warning \r\n          has been narrated, or for which there is a specific <i>hadd<\/i> punishment \r\n          in this world or torment in the Hereafter) cannot be expiated for by \r\n          righteous deeds. Rather the one who commits such sins has to repent \r\n          sincerely from them. Whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance. \r\n          There are many kinds of major sins such as lying, <i>zinaa<\/i>, <i>riba<\/i> \r\n          (usury\/interest), stealing, not wearing hijaab at all, and so on. &nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>Based on the above, we cannot say for \r\n          certain whether a woman who does not wear hijaab will enter Hell, but \r\n          she deserves the punishment of Allaah because she has disobeyed His \r\n          command to her.&nbsp; With regard to her specific fate, Allaah knows \r\n          best what it will be.

If a person really achieves \r\n          these righteous deeds, this is a strong indication that she loves goodness \r\n          and hates evil. Let us not forget that prayer prevents immorality and \r\n          evil, and that good deeds bring more of the same. Whoever fears Allaah \r\n          concerning his nafs, Allaah will support him and help him against his \r\n          nafs. It seems that there is much goodness in this Muslim woman, and \r\n          she is close to the path of righteousness. So she should strive to wear \r\n          hijaab as her Lord has commanded her. She should ignore the specious \r\n          arguments and resist the pressures of her family. She should not listen \r\n          to the words of those who criticize her, and she should ignore the specious \r\n          arguments of those sinful women who want to make a display of themselves \r\n          according to fashion, and she should resist the desires of her own self \r\n          which may tempt her to show off her beauty and feel proud of it. She \r\n          should adhere to that which will afford her protection and modesty, \r\n          and rise above being a mere commodity to be enjoyed by every evil person \r\n          who comes and goes. She should refuse to be a source of temptation to \r\n          the slaves of Allaah. We appeal to her faith and her love for Allaah \r\n          and His Messenger, and we urge her&nbsp; to&nbsp; observe the hijaab \r\n          enjoined by Allaah and to obey the commands of Allaah (interpretation \r\n          if the meanings): &nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><i><\/i><\/big><i>&#8220;and not to show off their adornment&#8221; \r\n          [al-Noor 24:31] <\/i><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><i><big>&#8220;and do not display yourselves like that of the times \r\n          of ignorance, and perform As Salaah (Iqamat as Salaah), and give Zakaah \r\n          and obey Allaah and His Messenger&#8221;[al-Ahzaab 33:33] <\/big><\/i><big>&nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>And Allaah is the Source of strength and the Guide to \r\n          the Straight Path. <\/big>\r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"9126","question_id":"9126","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><span><\/span><\/big><span>Undoubtedly \r\n          it is better for women to stay at home, as Allaah says (interpretation \r\n          of the meaning): <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><i><span>&ldquo;And \r\n          stay in your houses&rdquo; <span>[al-Ahzaab \r\n          33:33] <\/span><\/span><\/i><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><span>And \r\n          the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n          of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Their houses are better for them.&rdquo; <span>(Narrated \r\n          by Abu Dawood, al-Salaah, 480.

Ibn Mas&#146;ood said:\r\n    such as the cloak and robe, i.e., what the women of the Arabs used to wear, an outer\r\n    garment which covered whatever the woman was wearing, except for whatever appeared from\r\n    beneath the outer garment. There is no sin on a woman with regard to this because it is\r\n    impossible to conceal it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly<\/p>\r\n    <p>(it should not be an adornment in and of itself).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;&#133; and not to show off their adornment&#133;&#148;\r\n    [al-Noor 24:31].<\/i> The general meaning of this phrase includes the outer garment,\r\n    because if it is decorated it will attract men&#146;s attention to her. This is supported\r\n    by the aayah in <i>Soorat al-Ahzaab<\/i> (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like\r\n    that of the times of ignorance&#148; [al-Ahzaab 33:33].<\/i> It is also supported by the\r\n    hadeeth in which the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &#147;There are three, do not ask me about them: a man who leaves the jamaa&#146;ah,\r\n    disobeys his leader and dies disobedient; a female or male slave who runs away then dies;\r\n    and a woman whose husband is absent and left her with everything she needs, and after he\r\n    left she made a wanton display of herself.

Transparent or see-thru\r\n    clothing makes a woman more tempting and beautiful. Concerning this the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;During the last days of my ummah there\r\n    will be women who are clothed but naked, with something on their heads like the humps of\r\n    camels. Curse them, for they are cursed.&#148; Another hadeeth adds: &#147;They will not\r\n    enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from\r\n    such and such a distance.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>(Narrated by Muslim from the report of Abu Hurayrah).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn &#145;Abd al-Barr said: what the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant was women who wear clothes made of light fabric\r\n    which describes and does not cover. They are clothed in name but naked in reality.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Transmitted by al-Suyooti in <i>Tanweer al-Hawaalik<\/i>, 3\/103.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>(It should be loose, not tight so that it describes any part of the\r\n    body).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The purpose of clothing is to prevent fitnah (temptation), and this can\r\n    only be achieved if clothes are wide and loose. Tight clothes, even if they conceal the\r\n    colour of the skin, still describe the size and shape of the body or part of it, and\r\n    create a vivid image in the minds of men. The corruption or invitation to corruption that\r\n    is inherent in that is quite obvious. So the clothes must be wide. Usaamah ibn Zayd said:\r\n    &#147;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave me a thick\r\n    Egyptian garment that was one of the gifts given to him by Duhyat al-Kalbi, and I gave it\r\n    to my wife to wear. He said, &#145;Why do I not see you wearing that Egyptian\r\n    garment?&#146; I said, &#145;I gave it to my wife to wear.&#146; He said, &#145;Tell her\r\n    to wear a gown underneath it, for I am afraid that it may describe the size of her\r\n    bones.&#146;&#148; (Narrated by al-Diyaa&#146; al-Maqdisi in <i>al-Ahaadeeth\r\n    al-Mukhtaarah<\/i>, 1\/442, and by Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi, with a hasan isnaad).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fifthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>(It should not be perfumed with bakhoor or fragrance)<\/p>\r\n    <p>There are many ahaadeeth which forbid women to wear perfume when they\r\n    go out of their houses. We will quote here some of those which have saheeh isnaads:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Abu Moosa al-Ash&#146;ari said: the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by\r\n        people so that they can smell her fragrance, is an adulteress.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Zaynab al-Thaqafiyyah reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n        Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;If any one of you (women) goes out to the mosque, let her\r\n        not touch any perfume.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Abu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n        Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Any woman who has scented herself with bakhoor (incense),\r\n        let her not attend &#145;Ishaa&#146; prayers with us.&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Moosa ibn Yassaar said that a woman passed by Abu Hurayrah and her scent\r\n        was overpowering. He said, &#147;O female slave of al-Jabbaar, are you going to the\r\n        mosque?&#148; She said, &#147;Yes,&#148; He said, &#147;And have you put on perfume\r\n        because of that?&#148; She said, &#147;Yes.&#148; He said, &#147;Go back and wash\r\n        yourself, for I heard the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n        say: &#145;If a woman comes out to the mosque and her fragrance is overpowering, Allaah\r\n        will not accept any prayer from her until she goes home and washes herself.&#146;&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>These ahaadeeth are general in implication. Just as the prohibition\r\n    covers perfume applied to the body, it also covers perfume applied to the clothes,\r\n    especially in the third hadeeth, where bakhoor (incense) is mentioned, because incense is\r\n    used specifically to perfume the clothes.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The reason for this prohibition is quite clear, which is that\r\n    women&#146;s fragrance may cause undue provocation of desires. The scholars also included\r\n    other things under this heading of things to be avoided by women who want to go to the\r\n    mosque, such as beautiful clothes, jewellery that can be seen, excessive adornments and\r\n    mingling with men. See <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 2\/279.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Daqeeq al-&#145;Eed said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>This indicates that it is forbidden for a woman who wants to go to the\r\n    mosque to wear perfume, because this causes provocation of men&#146;s desires.

This is an important Islamic principle which nowadays,\r\n    unfortunately, is neglected by many Muslims, even those who care about religion and\r\n    calling others to Islam. This is due either to ignorance of their religion, or because\r\n    they are following their own whims and desires, or because of deviation, combined with\r\n    modern customs and imitation of kaafir Europe.

To proceed:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The basic \r\n    principle is that the woman is fitnah in her image and her voice. The \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I am not leaving \r\n    behind me any fitnah more harmful to men than women.&rdquo; (Agreed upon). Hence \r\n    those who follow their whims and desires are very keen to introduce women \r\n    into all media programming, both audio and video. Based on that, it is not \r\n    permissible for a woman to appear on TV, even if she is wearing hijab, in \r\n    the name of da&lsquo;wah and giving fatwas, because innumerable men will listen to \r\n    her even if she only appears on the channel on the basis of teaching women. \r\n    Moreover, there is no need for her to undertake da&lsquo;wah and issue fatwas via \r\n    TV channels. The basic principle is that that is to be done by men, and men \r\n    are more suited to that. Throughout Islamic history men have been the ones \r\n    to teach, call people to Islam and issue fatwas in the mosques and so on. \r\n    They are the khateebs and imams. It is not permissible for women to do any \r\n    of these things unless it is among other women.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Moreover it is \r\n    well known that women&rsquo;s participation in video and audio media results in \r\n    things that are contrary to sharee&lsquo;ah, such as their going out \r\n    unnecessarily, mixing with men, making images of them even if they do wear \r\n    hijab. This results in negative consequences that Islam came to prevent, as \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;O wives of \r\n    the Prophet!

If it looks at something ugly or something that it does not like \r\n    of clothing or garments, it will go to the heart and thus resentment and \r\n    hatred will be generated.

This is what is \r\n    prescribed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>With regard to \r\n    the issue of &lsquo;awrah, the &lsquo;awrah for a woman in front of other women is like \r\n    the &lsquo;awrah for a man in front of other men, i.e., the area between the navel \r\n    and the knee. But saying that does not mean that it is permissible for a \r\n    woman to appear in front of other women wearing nothing but pants that cover \r\n    from the navel to the knee. No one would say that. Whoever says such a thing \r\n    is misguided. Rather what is meant is that if a woman is wearing covering \r\n    clothes, and she needs to uncover her forearms to do some work or because of \r\n    some disease in the forearms and like, or she wants to breastfeed her child \r\n    in front of other women, so she uncovers her breast in front of the women, \r\n    there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>So there is a \r\n    difference between the concept of &lsquo;awrah and the manner of dress that is \r\n    prescribed. What is prescribed for women is that their clothing should cover \r\n    them properly, and it is permissible for a woman to uncover her head, face, \r\n    neck and hands, and even her forearms, feet and lower legs in front of her \r\n    mahrams. But that does not mean that we say she can wear short dresses in \r\n    front of her mahrams; not at all.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This is \r\n    another matter. But if we assume, for example, that she lifts up her dress \r\n    for some reason, and her mahrams are present and her lower leg shows, then \r\n    there is nothing wrong with that.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>End quote from\r\n    <i>al-Liqa&rsquo; al-Maftooh<\/i>. 126\/23.

Undoubtedly this open manifestation includes \r\n          remembering Allaah and reciting Qur&rsquo;aan, as well as dressing in an Islamic \r\n          fashion, allowing the beard to grow, and avoiding haraam things such \r\n          as drinking alcohol, etc. As far as dress is concerned, we think that \r\n          if you are able to openly wear Islamic clothing, then you should do \r\n          so, and wear the dress of the Muslims, and you should say, &lsquo;We are Muslims \r\n          and we have freedom to choose our religion and practise it openly, just \r\n          as you Christians can wear your regular clothes and openly display the \r\n          symbols of your religion, like the crosses you wear. We have the same \r\n          rights as you do. If this system places these obligations on those who \r\n          work for them, then we say that if you can find another country to move \r\n          to where you will be able to openly manifest the symbols of your religion, \r\n          then do so. But if you cannot do that, then manifest as much as you \r\n          can of the symbols of your faith. The religion cannot be confined to \r\n          the home and the mosque; the religion has to be adhered to in the market-places, \r\n          streets, companies and all public places. Undoubtedly the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not compromise in matters \r\n          of his religion. When he was in Makkah, before the Hijrah, he used to \r\n          pray openly, whilst they were looking on. After the Muslims became a \r\n          distinct community, a specific style of dress was ordained for them, \r\n          and they commanded to forsake anything else that was a symbol of kufr \r\n          and was distinctive to the kuffaar, because this is imitation, and whoever \r\n          imitates a people is one of them, as it says in the hadeeth. <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;<i>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen<\/i><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;You should make the most of the opportunity \r\n          of being in a Muslim country to remind the people of their Islamic origins \r\n          and their ties to their religion and Islamic history.

The Muslim is not permitted to imitate the kuffaar by wearing clothing that is\r\n    unique to them and for which they are known, like the belt worn by Christian monks, or the\r\n    distinctive headgear of Magians (Zoroastrians) and Jews, because of the hadeeth of the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &quot;Whoever imitates a people is\r\n    one of them.&quot; <em>(Reported by Abu Dawood, 4\/314).<\/em><br>\r\n    The scholars have specified that the prohibition of imitation applies in two cases:<br>\r\n    1. Where what is imitated is clothing that is characteristic of the kuffaar, not things\r\n    that are worn by others too or things that used to be distinct to them but have now become\r\n    widespread among other groups too - like the jeans referred to in the question.<br>\r\n    2. When the act of imitation happens at a time when the clothing in question is\r\n    characteristic of the kuffaar. This is because al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy\r\n    on him) reported that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) saw some people wearing\r\n    shawl-like garments over their heads and shoulders, and said, &quot;They look like the\r\n    Jews of Khaybar.&quot; Ibn Hajar commented: &quot;This could be used as evidence that this\r\n    kind of garment was characteristic of the Jews at that time, but this is no longer the\r\n    case, so that garment is now counted as something that is in general permitted.&quot;\r\n    (Fath al-Baari, 10\/275).<br>\r\n    The scholars also made an exception concerning Muslims wearing the distinctive clothes of\r\n    the kuffaar when living in daar al-harb (non-Muslim countries which are at war with\r\n    Muslims) or for purposes which will benefit the Muslims. Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah\r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br>\r\n    &quot;When a Muslim is living in a non-Muslim land (whether or not it is hostile to\r\n    Islam), he is not expected to differ from them (the kuffaar) in his outward appearance,\r\n    because of the harm that may result (from dressing as a Muslim). It is preferable, even\r\n    obligatory, for a man to look like them sometimes, if that will achieve some religious\r\n    purpose such as calling them to Islam, finding out their secrets in order to tell the\r\n    Muslims about them, repelling their harm from the Muslims, and other worthwhile aims. But\r\n    in the Muslim lands where Allaah has caused His religion to prevail, and where the kuffaar\r\n    are in an inferior position and are paying jizyah (taxes paid by non-Muslims living under\r\n    an Islamic government), it is obligatory for Muslims to look different from the\r\n    kuffaar.&quot; (Iqtidaa' al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 1\/418).<br>\r\n    It is clear from the above that jeans are not clothes that are characteristic of the\r\n    kuffaar or worn only by them, so they are not haraam. However, it is more befitting for\r\n    the Muslim to try to wear distinctive Islamic dress wherever he is, in obedience to the\r\n    way of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Muslim should feel in\r\n    his heart that he hates the kuffaar and the way they look and behave. This hatred will\r\n    motivate him to avoid looking like them at all in the way he dresses or in other ways. Do\r\n    you not see that a person who despises a people or tribe, or people from a certain\r\n    country, will hate to dress like them, especially if they are poor.

He does not command anything except\r\n    that which is in people&#146;s best interests and He does not forbid anything except that\r\n    which is harmful. People may or may not come to understand the reasons behind these\r\n    commands and prohibitions, although Allaah has His Wisdom in any given issue. Having said\r\n    that, it is still not right to make following a command or prohibition dependent upon\r\n    knowing the wisdom behind it; rather we should hasten to carry out the commands of\r\n    sharee&#146;ah, regardless of whether the wisdom behind it is clear to us or not. If it is\r\n    clear, then praise be to Allaah, and if it is not, then the Muslim should not let the fact\r\n    that he does not know it prevent him from acting in accordance with the ruling of\r\n    sharee&#146;ah. This is true submission to the command of Allaah, and Islam means\r\n    submission to Allaah, may He be exalted, and obeying Him. If a person makes his actions\r\n    dependent on understanding matters which may or may not convince him, he is in effect\r\n    following his own thoughts and desires, not his Lord and Master.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The above does not mean that it is not important to look for the wisdom\r\n    behind the rules of sharee&#146;ah, or that doing so is forbidden, but we should not make\r\n    knowing the reasons a condition for acting upon the ruling.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly: there is no connection between things that are prohibited in\r\n    this world and those that are allowed in the Hereafter. It is not correct to think of the\r\n    Hereafter as being like this world; each realm has its own rules and laws. It is not\r\n    correct to suggest that something is permitted in this world on the basis that it is\r\n    permitted in Paradise or in the Hereafter, otherwise we would end up allowing things that\r\n    we know from the basics of Islam are forbidden, such as drinking wine, taking more than\r\n    four wives, singing etc. On this basis, the confusion reflected in the question about silk\r\n    being forbidden in this world although it is permitted in Paradise should be cleared up.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly: The scholars have discussed the reasons for silk being\r\n    forbidden for men in this world. For example, al-&#145;Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim suggested in\r\n    his brilliant work <i>Zaad al-Ma&#146;aad<\/i> that <\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;Among those who believe that there is reason and wisdom (behind\r\n    the rulings of Islam) &#150; and they are the majority &#150; are some who answer that\r\n    Islam has forbidden it so that people will keep away from it and give it up for the sake\r\n    of Allaah, so they will be rewarded for that. Others reply that it was basically created\r\n    for women, as is the case with gold jewellery, so it was forbidden for men because it can\r\n    corrupt them by making them resemble women. Some of them said that it was forbidden\r\n    because of what it may lead to in the way of pride, showing off and self-admiration. Some\r\n    of them said that it was forbidden because when it touches the body, it makes a man\r\n    effeminate and goes against his masculinity and manliness, so if he wears it his heart\r\n    gains the characteristics of femininity and softness, as is obvious, even if he was the\r\n    most masculine and chivalrous of men. There is no doubt that wearing silk will diminish\r\n    these manly characteristics, if not take them away altogether. Whoever is too dense to\r\n    understand this should just submit to the Wise Lawmaker.&#148; <\/p>\r\n    <p>(<i>Zaad al-Ma&#146;aad<\/i>, 4\/80).

There are shar&rsquo;i \r\n  texts which encourage the wearing of certain colours and forbid the wearing \r\n  of other colours, such as the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><u>Black<\/u>: Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid said: \r\n  &ldquo;The Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n  be upon him) was brought some clothes, among which was a small black khameesah \r\n  [garment].

He took the khameesah in his hand and put it on her, \r\n  and said, &lsquo;May you live long and wear it out.&rsquo; There was a green or \r\n  yellow mark on it, and he said, &lsquo;O Umm Khaalid, this is <i>sanaah<\/i> (good),&rsquo; \r\n  and <i>sanaah<\/i> is an Abyssinian word.&rdquo; (Reported by al-Bukhaari). \r\n  Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;I saw the Messenger of Allaah \r\n  <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on \r\n  the day of the Conquest of Makkah, wearing a black turban.&rdquo; (Reported \r\n  by Muslim). &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) \r\n  said: &ldquo;I made a black burdah (cloak) for the Messenger of Allaah (<img> \r\n  ) peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he wore it, but when he sweated \r\n  in it he detected the smell of wool on it, so he took it off, because he used \r\n  to like pleasant smells.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haakim (4\/188) \r\n  said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs. Al-Dhahabi \r\n  agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said in <i>al-Saheehah<\/i> (5\/168, no. 2136): \r\n  It is as they said. Abu Dawood named a chapter in his <i>Sunan<\/i> &ldquo;<i>Bab \r\n  fi&rsquo;l-Suwaad<\/i> (chapter on black clothes)&rdquo;.

One of the \r\n  false innovations (bid&rsquo;ah) connected to this colour is the practice of \r\n  deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating \r\n  the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen said (<i>Fataawa \r\n  Islamiyah<\/i>, 3\/313): &ldquo;Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false \r\n  symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded \r\n  in Islam, which is to say &lsquo;<i>Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji&rsquo;oon. \r\n  Allaahumma ajirni fi museebati wa&rsquo;khluf li khayran minhaa<\/i> (Truly!

I came back to him (later), and he had woken up&hellip;&rdquo; (Reported \r\n  by al-Bukhaari in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, in a chapter he called <i>Baab<\/i> <i>al-Thiyaab \r\n  al-Beed<\/i> (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported \r\n  that Sa&rsquo;d said: &ldquo;I saw on the left of the Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing \r\n  white clothes on the day of Uhud.

White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living \r\n  to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated \r\n  by Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;Wear your white clothes, \r\n  for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.&rsquo;&rdquo; \r\n  (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n  in <i>Ahkaam al-Janaa&rsquo;iz<\/i> (p. 82)).

According to the commentary of al-Sindi on \r\n  <i>Sunan al-Nisaa&rsquo;i<\/i>, <i>mafdam<\/i> is something that is filled with \r\n  red. It was reported that if &lsquo;Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red \r\n  with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, &ldquo;Leave this for the women.&rdquo; \r\n  (Reported by al-Tabari).<\/p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr said: &ldquo;A \r\n  man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but \r\n  the Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n  him) did not respond.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, \r\n  and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, \r\n  which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden \r\n  to wear red, including the following:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>because it is the dress of the kuffaar<\/p>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is \r\n      a way of discouraging the imitation of women<\/p>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear \r\n      it<\/p>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The prohibition applies only to garments that \r\n  are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, \r\n  black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the \r\n  red <i>hullah<\/i> should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara&rsquo; \r\n  (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: &ldquo;The Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him \r\n  wearing a red <i>hullah<\/i>, and I have never seen anything better than it.&rdquo; \r\n  (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni <i>hullah<\/i> \r\n  usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red.<\/p>\r\n<p> Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, \r\n  said: &ldquo;The clothing (of the Prophet <img> (peace \r\n  and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): Abu&rsquo;l-Waleed told us Shu&rsquo;bah \r\n  told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara&rsquo; (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n  him) saying: &lsquo;The Prophet <img> (peace and blessings \r\n  of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red <i>hullah<\/i>, \r\n  and I have never seen anything better than it.&rsquo; The hullah consists of \r\n  an izaar and a rida&rsquo; (lower and upper garments)&hellip; It is a mistake to \r\n  think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour.

Abu Dawood named a chapter in his <i>Sunan<\/i> &ldquo;<i>Bab \r\n  fi&rsquo;l-Suwaad<\/i> (chapter on black clothes)&rdquo;. The author of &lsquo;<i>Awn \r\n  al-Ma&rsquo;bood<\/i> (11\/126) said: The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible \r\n  to wear black and that there is nothing makrooh in doing so). <\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Black is permissible for both men and women alike. One of the \r\n  false innovations (bid&rsquo;ah) connected to this colour is the practice of \r\n  deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating \r\n  the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen said (<i>Fataawa \r\n  Islamiyah<\/i>, 3\/313): &ldquo;Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false \r\n  symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded \r\n  in Islam, which is to say &lsquo;<i>Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji&rsquo;oon. \r\n  Allaahumma ajirni fi museebati wa&rsquo;khluf li khayran minhaa<\/i> (Truly! To \r\n  Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allaah, reward me for \r\n  my calamity and compensate me with something better than it).&rsquo; If a person \r\n  says this with faith and the hope of reward, Allaah will reward him for that \r\n  and will replace what he has lost with something better.&rdquo; He also said: \r\n  &ldquo;Allocating certain clothes for mourning is an act of bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) \r\n  in our opinion, and because it could indicate that a person is discontent with \r\n  the decree of Allaah.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>White<\/u>: Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased \r\n  with him) said: &ldquo;I came to the Prophet <img> (peace \r\n  and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he was wearing a white garment and \r\n  was asleep. I came back to him (later), and he had woken up&hellip;&rdquo; (Reported \r\n  by al-Bukhaari in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, in a chapter he called <i>Baab<\/i> <i>al-Thiyaab \r\n  al-Beed<\/i> (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported \r\n  that Sa&rsquo;d said: &ldquo;I saw on the left of the Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing \r\n  white clothes on the day of Uhud. I never saw them before or since.&rdquo; These \r\n  two men were Jibreel and Mikaa&rsquo;eel, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in \r\n  <i>al-Fath<\/i> (10\/295). White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living \r\n  to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated \r\n  by Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &lsquo;Wear your white clothes, \r\n  for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.&rsquo;&rdquo; \r\n  (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n  in <i>Ahkaam al-Janaa&rsquo;iz<\/i> (p. 82)). White is also the \r\n  preferred colour for men&rsquo;s ihraam (special garments for Hajj), which consists \r\n  of an izaar (lower garment) and a rida&rsquo; (upper garment).<\/p>\r\n<p> <u>Green<\/u>: Abu Ramthah said: &ldquo;I saw \r\n  the Messenger of Allaah <img> (peace and blessings of \r\n  Allaah be upon him) wearing two green garments.&rdquo; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, \r\n  who said, this is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth, and by al-Nisaa&rsquo;i, 5224).<\/p>\r\n<p><u>Red<\/u>: It was reported that wearing pure \r\n  red is forbidden for men, but not for women, because of the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar: \r\n  &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img> (peace and blessings \r\n  of Allaah be upon him) forbade <i>mafdam<\/i>&rdquo; (reported by Imaam \r\n  Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 3591). <i>Mafdam<\/i> is something that \r\n  is filled with red safflower dye. According to the commentary of al-Sindi on \r\n  <i>Sunan al-Nisaa&rsquo;i<\/i>, <i>mafdam<\/i> is something that is filled with \r\n  red. It was reported that if &lsquo;Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red \r\n  with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, &ldquo;Leave this for the women.&rdquo; \r\n  (Reported by al-Tabari).<\/p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr said: &ldquo;A \r\n  man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but \r\n  the Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n  him) did not respond.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, \r\n  and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, \r\n  which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden \r\n  to wear red, including the following:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>because it is the dress of the kuffaar<\/p>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is \r\n      a way of discouraging the imitation of women<\/p>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear \r\n      it<\/p>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The prohibition applies only to garments that \r\n  are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, \r\n  black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the \r\n  red <i>hullah<\/i> should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara&rsquo; \r\n  (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: &ldquo;The Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him \r\n  wearing a red <i>hullah<\/i>, and I have never seen anything better than it.&rdquo; \r\n  (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni <i>hullah<\/i> \r\n  usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red.<\/p>\r\n<p> Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, \r\n  said: &ldquo;The clothing (of the Prophet <img> (peace \r\n  and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): Abu&rsquo;l-Waleed told us Shu&rsquo;bah \r\n  told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara&rsquo; (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n  him) saying: &lsquo;The Prophet <img> (peace and blessings \r\n  of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red <i>hullah<\/i>, \r\n  and I have never seen anything better than it.&rsquo; The hullah consists of \r\n  an izaar and a rida&rsquo; (lower and upper garments)&hellip; It is a mistake to \r\n  think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour. The red hullah \r\n  is two Yemeni garments woven with red and black stripes like all the other Yemeni \r\n  garments&hellip; But pure red is emphatically forbidden. In <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> \r\n  it is stated that the Prophet <img> (peace and blessings \r\n  of Allaah be upon him) forbade red saddlecloths (or blankets) &hellip; With regard \r\n  to red garments in general and red broadcloth, etc., the issue is still under \r\n  discussion, but it is very disliked (makrooh).&rdquo; (<i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, \r\n  1\/139).

Purity is a condition of prayer being valid, and janaabah \r\n    necessitates ghusl. The prayers that you offered whilst junub are excused \r\n    because you did not do that deliberately, but you did not discharge your \r\n    duty after you realized what your situation was until you did ghusl and \r\n    repeated the prayers. This is what you did and this is correct.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked \r\n    about someone who noticed semen on his clothes after he had prayed Fajr, and \r\n    he had not noticed it before. What is the ruing on that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he did not go back to sleep after praying Fajr then his \r\n    Fajr prayer is not valid because he did it when he was junub, as he can be \r\n    certain that it happened before he prayed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he went back to sleep after praying Fajr, then he does \r\n    not know whether this happened during his sleep after the prayer or during \r\n    his sleep before the prayer, so the basic principle is to assume that it \r\n    happened after the prayer and that the prayer is valid. The same ruling \r\n    applies if a person notices traces of semen and is not sure whether that is \r\n    from the previous night or the night before that, so he should assume that \r\n    it is from the previous night and that it happened in the last period of \r\n    sleep, because that is more certain, whereas there is some doubt concerning \r\n    what came before that, and if there is doubt concerning something that \r\n    invalidates one&rsquo;s state of purity there is no obligation to purify oneself \r\n    from it. The Prophet (S) said: &ldquo;If one of you feels something in his stomach \r\n    and is not sure whether something (i.e., wind) came out of him or not, then \r\n    he should not leave the mosque.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu \r\n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). And Allaah is the Source of \r\n    strength.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    11\/question no. 165.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Shaykh was also asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A person prayed Maghrib \r\n    and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, then he went home. When he took off his clothes he noticed \r\n    traces of semen on his underwear. What should he do?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this man who found semen on his clothes did not do ghusl, \r\n    then he has to do ghusl and repeat the prayers that he offered when he was \r\n    junub. But sometimes a man may see traces of janaabah on his clothes and not \r\n    know whether that happened the previous night &ndash; should he regard that as \r\n    having happened the night before or on a previous night?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that he should regard it as having happened on \r\n    the night before, because there is some doubt concerning the previous night, \r\n    so the basic principle is that he was in a state of purity (on the previous \r\n    night). Similarly if he went to sleep after praying Fajr then woke up and \r\n    noticed traces of janaabah on his clothes, and he does not know whether that \r\n    was from his sleep after Fajr or his sleep during the night, should he \r\n    repeat Fajr prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer is that he does not have to repeat Fajr prayer, \r\n    because there is no certainty that he had a wet dream whilst he slept during \r\n    the night.

As for letting the garment hang low for reasons other than \r\n    showing off when praying, it is not as serious, because of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) when he told him that his izaar slipped down on one side: \r\n    &ldquo;You are not one of them (i.e., those who let the garment hang down out of \r\n    pride).&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And al-Nawawi said in <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i> (14\/62):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible to let the garment hang down below the \r\n    ankles if it is done in order to show off. If it is done for any other \r\n    reason then it is makrooh. The apparent meaning of the ahaadeeth which limit \r\n    it to letting the garment drag in order to show off indicates that it is \r\n    haraam specifically when done to show off.

So you see him \r\n    showing arrogance and defending his foolish action, taking a hadeeth that is \r\n    general in meaning and quoting another hadeeth so as to limit the meaning of \r\n    the first one to pride, and he thinks that he can get away with his isbaal \r\n    on the basis of what (Abu Bakr) as-Siddeeq said: O Messenger of Allah, my \r\n    izaar slips, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said, &ldquo;O Abu Bakr, you are not one of those who do that out of pride.&rdquo; But \r\n    we say: Abu Bakr did not put on his izaar in such a way that it came below \r\n    the ankles from the outset; rather he put it on so that it came above the \r\n    ankles, then after that it slipped. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The izaar of the believer comes to mid-calf and \r\n    there is no problem with the area between that and the ankle.&rdquo; End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Siyar A&lsquo;laam an-Nubala&rsquo;<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    3\/234&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy \r\n    on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>With regard to those who quote to us the \r\n    hadeeth of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), we say to him: You have \r\n    no proof in this hadeeth for two reasons:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(i)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;One of the two sides of my izaar drop unless I pay attention to it&hellip;&rdquo; \r\n    So he (may Allah be pleased with him) was not letting his garment drag \r\n    deliberately; rather it used to loosen and drop, yet he would still pay \r\n    attention to it. Those who let the garment come below the ankles and claim \r\n    that they are not doing that out of pride are letting their garments hang \r\n    low deliberately.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(ii)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) praised Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) and testified \r\n    that he was not one of those who did that out of pride.

But the Shaytaan prompts \r\n    some people to follow ambiguous texts of the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah so as to \r\n    justify what they are doing, and Allah guides whomever He will to the \r\n    straight path. We ask Allah to guide us and keep us safe and sound.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/span><\/i><span> \r\n    (12\/question no. 223)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him), when he said: O Messenger of Allah, my izaar slips unless I pay \r\n    attention to it, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to \r\n    him: &ldquo;You are not one of those who do that out of pride&rdquo;, what the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) meant is that the one who pays \r\n    attention to his garment if it slips, and pulls it up, is not regarded as \r\n    being one of those who let the garment drag out of pride, because he did not \r\n    let it hang low deliberately. Rather it may slip, so he pulls it up and pays \r\n    attention to it. Undoubtedly such a person is excused. As for the one who \r\n    deliberately lets it drag, whether it is a (man&rsquo;s) abayah or pants or an \r\n    izaar (waist wrapper) or a thobe, he is included in this warning and he is \r\n    not excused for letting his garment come below the ankles, because the \r\n    saheeh hadeeths that forbid isbaal include him in their meanings. What every \r\n    Muslim should do is guard against isbaal and fear Allah with regard to that; \r\n    he should not let his garment hang below his ankles, following this saheeh \r\n    hadeeth and seeking to avoid the wrath and punishment of Allah.

It is not \r\n    possible to interpret the general report in terms of the specific report in \r\n    this case because there are two different actions with two different \r\n    punishments, and those whom the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) rebuked were not people of arrogance and pride.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In these hadeeths we see that letting the \r\n    garment come below the ankles out of pride is a major sin; as for letting \r\n    the garment come below the ankles for a reason other than pride, the \r\n    apparent meaning of the hadeeths is that it is also haraam.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Fath al-Baari<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    10\/263&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi al-Maaliki (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is not permissible for a man to let his \r\n    garment come past his ankle and say, &ldquo;I am not doing that out of pride,&rdquo; \r\n    because the prohibition on that was clearly stated (in the hadeeth) and the \r\n    reason for it was stated. So he cannot say, &ldquo;I am not among those to whom \r\n    the hadeeth refers because the reason for the prohibition does not apply to \r\n    me,&rdquo; because this is going against sharee&lsquo;ah and it is a claim that cannot \r\n    be accepted.

But when a girl reaches an age when men could be \r\n    attracted to her and desire her, then she should observe hijab so as to ward \r\n    off fitnah and evil.

Hence Islam gives children a \r\n    preparatory stage in which they can get used to praying and does not make it \r\n    obligatory all of a sudden, because it takes time to get used to it and \r\n    learn it. When a girl is nine years old, she should start learning and \r\n    getting used to what will be required of her, before she reaches puberty. It \r\n    does not make any sense to make the difference between covering the &lsquo;awrah \r\n    and not doing so the night when the girl gets her period and reaches \r\n    puberty.

This is the \r\n    guideline. But if the thing has become widespread among both Muslims and \r\n    kaafirs, then this imitation is permissible, even if it was originally taken \r\n    from the kuffaar, so long as it is not haraam in and of itself, such as \r\n    wearing silk.

This outlining of the lips and eyes remains for a year or half a year, \r\n    then it is done again when it fades and remains for a similar length of \r\n    time, so it is similar to the tattooing that is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that kohl is a remedy for the eyes, \r\n    and its colour is black or grey; it is applied to the lashes and eyelids \r\n    when there is a disorder in the eye, or in order to protect the eye from \r\n    disease, and it may be a beauty and adornment for women, as a permissible \r\n    kind of adornment.

The colour of the gold may be made pinkish by adding 5% silver \r\n    or 20% copper. A greenish colour may be achieved by mixing 75% gold with 25% \r\n    silver, or mixing it with zinc and cadmium. A bluish colour may be achieved \r\n    by mixing the gold with a small amount of iron. If the gold is mixed with \r\n    20% aluminium the resulting colour will be purple. The degree of redness in \r\n    the gold may be controlled by increasing or decreasing the amount of copper \r\n    that is added. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Professor Dr. Mamdooh &lsquo;Abd al-Ghafoor Hasan said in his book\r\n    <i>Mamlakat al-Ma&rsquo;aadin<\/i> (the Kingdom of metals): Pure gold is not hard \r\n    enough to be used for making jewellery, but it may be mixed with copper, \r\n    silver, nickel or platinum to make it harder, which at the same time gives \r\n    it distinctive colours. A little copper makes it more reddish in colour, and \r\n    silver make it more whitish. Adding 25% platinum or 15% nickel produces an \r\n    ingot that is called &ldquo;white gold.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: gold is originally yellow in colour, and there is \r\n    no gold that is white in colour, rather other metals may be added to it that \r\n    change its colour to white.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So white gold is nothing more than yellow gold, but platinum \r\n    has been added to it, instead of silver or copper. Hence in the stores the \r\n    white gold has exactly the same standards as yellow gold. It is well known \r\n    that adding silver or copper to gold does not alter the fact that it is \r\n    gold, and it is does not make it permissible to use it. That also applies to \r\n    adding palladium to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, wearing white gold is haraam for men, because \r\n    in fact it is yellow gold, but something had been added to it to change its \r\n    colour to white.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: It has \r\n    become common among some people, especially men, to use that which is called \r\n    white gold, which is used to make watches, rings, pens and so on. After \r\n    asking the jewellers and goldsmiths, we found out that white gold is \r\n    actually the well-known yellow gold, to which a certain metal has been \r\n    added, 5-10%, to change its colour from yellow to white, or some other \r\n    colour, which makes it look like another kind of metal. Use of this has \r\n    become very widespread in&nbsp; recent times, and many people are confused about \r\n    using it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the situation is as described, the gold which is mixed \r\n    with other metals still comes under the ruling that it is haraam to \r\n    differentiate in weight or measure when selling it for gold of the same \r\n    type, and the exchange must be completed in one sitting, whether it is sold \r\n    for gold of the same type or for silver or cash. It is haraam for men to \r\n    wear it, and it is haraam to make vessels out of it. Calling it white gold \r\n    does not change these rulings.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Say (O Muhammad): &lsquo;Who has forbidden the adornment with \r\n    clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and \r\n    At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) things] of food?&rsquo; Say: &lsquo;They are, \r\n    in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them \r\n    (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share \r\n    them).&rsquo; Thus We explain the Ayaat (Islamic laws) in detail for people who \r\n    have knowledge&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:32]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So no kinds of adornment are forbidden except those for which \r\n    there is proof with shar&rsquo;i evidence that they are haraam.

Wearing them for the purpose of adornment is \r\n    not included in this prohibition.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If these threads are usually worn to ward off sickness or the \r\n    evil eye, then wearing them is haraam, and a woman is forbidden to wear them \r\n    even if she does not intend that haraam purpose, and she only intended it as \r\n    an adornment, because in that case she is still resembling those who wear \r\n    them for a haraam purpose, so she exposes herself to suspicion and gossip, \r\n    as people will think that she is wearing them for that haraam purpose.

If it is one of their unique characteristics and \r\n    symbols, then wearing it is haraam, because it is established in sharee&rsquo;ah \r\n    that it is haraam to imitate the enemies of Allaah, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever imitates a people \r\n    is one of them.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is proven that it involves imitating the kuffaar, then \r\n    wearing it is haraam, even for those who do not wear it with any intention \r\n    of imitating the kuffaar, because imitating them may happen in one&rsquo;s \r\n    clothing and appearance, whether one intends to resemble them or not, as was \r\n    explained by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    in <i>al-Qawl al-Mufeed<\/i> (3\/203).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to examining the intention before denouncing \r\n    evil, whatever is proven to be evil according to sharee&rsquo;ah must be \r\n    denounced, and the intention of the one who does it does not matter, because \r\n    a good intention does not turn an evil deed into a good one. Evil is evil \r\n    even if the person intends something good thereby.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But intention &ndash; good or bad &ndash; can turn permissible things \r\n    into acts of worship or sins. If a person eats with the intention of \r\n    strengthening himself for worship, this is an act of obedience and worship. \r\n    If he intends thereby to strengthen himself to wrong people or commit \r\n    immoral deeds, then it is a sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: If these necklaces and bracelets are worn with the \r\n    intention of warding off the evil eye or jinn, or to bring good luck and the \r\n    like, then wearing them is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly it is haraam to wear them if they are unique \r\n    characteristics or clothing of the kuffaar.

The texts which \r\n    indicate that include the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; It was \r\n    narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out and prayed, then \r\n    he delivered a khutbah &ndash; and he did not mention any adhaan or iqaamah &ndash; then \r\n    he went to the women and exhorted and reminded them, and told them to give \r\n    charity, and I saw them taking off their earrings and necklaces and giving \r\n    them to Bilaal, then he and Bilaal went back to his house. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (4951) and Muslim (884).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>According to \r\n    another report narrated by them both:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>They started \r\n    throwing their earrings and necklaces.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;2 &ndash; It was \r\n    narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: Eleven women \r\n    sat and promised one another that they would not conceal anything about \r\n    their husbands &hellip; the eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zar&rsquo; and what (can \r\n    I say about) Abu Zar&rsquo;?

The \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had hair that \r\n    sometimes came down almost to his shoulders.

So the issue of whether men may grow their hair long \r\n    is something that is permitted, but is subject to the customs and traditions \r\n    of the people. If custom dictates that all people, noble and lowly alike, \r\n    grow their hair long, there is nothing wrong with it; if it is done only by \r\n    the lowest of people, then people of honour and status should not do it. No \r\n    one should respond by saying that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) &ndash; who was the noblest of people and the highest in \r\n    status &ndash; used to grow his hair long, because we can see that growing one's \r\n    hair long is not a Sunnah or an act of worship, rather it is the matter of \r\n    following customs and traditions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h2>\r\n    Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala Darb&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What your husband says about the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) having four braids is correct, but that \r\n    does not mean that this is a Sunnah for which a person will be rewarded, \r\n    rather the customs of the people and what they are used to should be heeded. \r\n    Customs are different now in most countries from what they were in the \r\n    past.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Nowadays no one braids their hair except soldiers who have \r\n    long hair; people of righteousness, modesty and knowledge have turned away \r\n    from this custom, until that has become one of their distinguishing \r\n    features. Nowadays long hair has virtually become the characteristic of the \r\n    foolish.

This isnaad of this \r\n    hadeeth includes &lsquo;Umar ibn Haroon who is matrook (rejected), as al-Haafiz \r\n    Ibn Hajar said in <i>al-Taqreeb<\/i>.

Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Zaad \r\n    al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i> (4\/195): &ldquo;Such as when the mureeds (disciples of Sufi shaykhs) \r\n    shave their heads for their shaykhs, and one of them says, &lsquo;I shaved my head \r\n    for So and so.&rsquo; This is like saying, &lsquo;I prostrated to So and so,&rsquo; because \r\n    shaving the head is an act of humility and submission, which is why it is \r\n    one of the acts that complete the Hajj, for it means putting one&rsquo;s forelock \r\n    in the hand of its Lord, in submission to His greatness and humbling oneself \r\n    before His glory.

This is \r\n    what the Khawaarij used to do. Hence it was narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the Khawaarij as \r\n    &ldquo;their sign will be that they shave their heads.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 7007; \r\n    Muslim, 1763). Al-Qurtubi said: &ldquo; &lsquo;Their sign will be that they shave their \r\n    heads&rsquo; means that they will make that a symbol of their rejection of worldly \r\n    adornments and a sign by which they might be known. This is ignorance on \r\n    their part&hellip; and introducing something into the religion of Allaah which \r\n    differs from that which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him), the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs and their followers used to do.&rdquo; \r\n    (See <i>Sharh al-&lsquo;Umdah<\/i>, 1\/231; <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 21\/118).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example is that which some people do, ordering a \r\n    person who has repented to shave his head.

But using these two hadeeth to show that it is \r\n    permissible to shave the head for no reason is a matter which is subject to \r\n    further discussion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly, shaving the head here is for a reason, so it is \r\n    permissible, the reason being that boys are more likely than others to be \r\n    affected by lice, because they sweat a lot and get dirty. <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, \r\n    4\/159.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly, this has to do with a young boy, and concessions \r\n    are made for children that are not made for adults. <i>Haashiyat al-Sindi \r\n    &lsquo;ala al-Nasaa&rsquo;i<\/i>.

So if the hair is very long or thick, and the woman cuts it to reduce \r\n          its length or volume, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Cutting some of it will make \r\n          it more beautiful, which will please both the woman and her husband. \r\n          So we do not know of any reason to disallow that.

The point is that\r\nthese are known as forms of women&#146;s adornment since ancient times. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourthly, Islam has given men sufficient scope to adorn themselves by\r\nallowing them to wear silver rings, as Ibn &#145;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and\r\nhis father) reported that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\nupon him) wore a ring made of silver, and the people did likewise. (Reported\r\nby al-Bukhaari, 5417). Islam also allows men to wear gold and silver\r\nwhen necessary to replace a lost tooth or nose, and so on. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we would say that any Muslim man who wears jewellery is making\r\nhimself look like the kuffaar, because this is known to be their style of adornment; the\r\nlatest fashion among them is to wear earrings and the like in their ears, noses, lips,\r\ncheeks and other parts of the body (so-called &#147;body-piercing&#148;). The Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Whoever imitates a people is one\r\nof them.&#148; (Reported by Abu Dawood, <i>al-Sunan, Kitaab al-libaas, Bab libaas\r\nal-shuhrah<\/i>). <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoever does this should repent to Allaah and not engage in the futile\r\ndefence of falsehood. He should be distinct in both his personality and his dress from the\r\nkuffaar, as Islam has commanded us to be.

It means dyeing grey hairs on the head and in the beard, for men. For\r\n    women, it refers to the hair of the head. <\/p>\r\n    <p>It was reported that Abu Hurayrah said: the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The Jews and the\r\n    Christians do not dye their hair, so be different from them.&rdquo; (Narrated by\r\n    al-Bukhaari, 3275; Muslim, 2103).<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was reported that Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased\r\n    him) said: &ldquo;O Ansaar, dye your hair red and yellow, and be different from the\r\n    A&rsquo;aajim (Persians).&rdquo; (Narrated by Ahmad, 21780. The isnaad of this\r\n    hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in <i>al-Fath<\/i>, 10\/354).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly: changing grey hair by dyeing it black is\r\n    haraam. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, who forbid it completely, because\r\n    of the hadeeth of the Messenger <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when he saw\r\n    Abu Quhaafah. Jaabir said: the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him_ said, when he saw his head looking as white as the <i>thaghaamah<\/i> plant,\r\n    &ldquo;Change this&hellip;&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 2102).<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said: There are people who dye their hair black like the crops of pigeons; they will\r\n    never smell the fragrance of Paradise.&rdquo; (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4212;\r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 5075).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Hajar said: the isnaad of this hadeeth is <i>qawiy<\/i>\r\n    (strong), but there is some dispute as to whether it is marfoo&rsquo; (narrated from the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) or mawqoof (the isnaad stops at the\r\n    Sahaabi). But even if we agree that it is mawqoof, it still has the status of being\r\n    marfoo&rsquo;, because the Sahaabah would not have spoken on the basis of their own\r\n    opinions, i.e., it must be something that they heard from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Fath al-baari, 6\/499.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly: with regard to katam, Ibn Hajar said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Katam is a plant from Yemen which produces a reddish-black dye. Henna\r\n    produces a red dye, so when they are used together as a dye, they produce a colour that is\r\n    between black and red. Fath al-Baari, 10\/355.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Did the Sahaabah use katam? Yes, they did that and so did the Messenger\r\n    of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was reported that &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Wahb said:\r\n    we entered upon Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and she brought out a lock of\r\n    hair of the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show us,\r\n    and it was dyed red. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5558. Ibn Maajah (3623) and Ahmad\r\n    (25995) added: &ldquo;&hellip; with henna and katam.&rdquo;)<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;The best things to use to change grey hair are henna and\r\n    katam.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1753; Abu Dawood, 4205; Ibn Maajah, 3622).\r\n    Al-Tirmidhi said: the hadeeth is hasan saheeh). Abu Bakr (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him) dyed his hair with henna and katam. (Narrated by Muslim, 2341).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fifthly: it may be noted that in the ahaadeeth where\r\n    katam is mentioned , it is always accompanied by henna, because what is meant by the\r\n    ahaadeeth is that the hair should be dyed with katam mixed with henna.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is prohibited is making the hair pure black, but if something else\r\n    is added to henna, such as katam etc., there is nothing wrong with that. Katam and henna\r\n    make the hair a colour between red and black, unlike wasmah (woad leaves) which make the\r\n    hair black as coal. This is saheeh. (<i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, 4\/336).<\/p>\r\n    <p>(Wasmah or woad is a plant that is used for dyeing).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence we know that katam is not to be used on its own, because it gives\r\n    a pure, coal-black colour, but it may be used with henna to give a black colour with\r\n    reddish highlights. Hence we can reconcile the ahaadeeth.

So it is not permissible to apply \r\n    cosmetics that will cause her physical harm, and it is not permissible for \r\n    this adornment to involve changing the creation of Allaah. Kohl, henna and \r\n    the like do not involve changing the creation of Allaah, unlike filing the \r\n    teeth, plucking the eyebrows and tattoos -- these things do involve changing \r\n    the creation of Allaah with regard to shape and colour, hence these actions \r\n    are haraam and are major sins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: May Allaah curse the one who does tattoos and the \r\n    one who has a tattoo done, the one who plucks eyebrows and the one who has \r\n    her eyebrows plucked, and those who file teeth for the purpose of \r\n    beautification, changing the creation of Allaah.

This does not matter.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the percentage of alcohol is very high, so that you can detect it, then\r\n    it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds\r\n    and the like.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do\r\n    not say that it is haram.

This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it.\r\n    If you say that it is open to speculation because Allaah says (interpretation of the\r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [animals that are\r\n    sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlaam [arrows for seeking luck or\r\n    decision], are an abomination of Shaytaan&rsquo;s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that\r\n    (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity\r\n    and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance\r\n    of Allaah and from al-salaah (the prayer).

If we look\r\n    at the reason why, Allaah says, <i>&ldquo;Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred\r\n    between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah\r\n    and from al-salaah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?&rdquo;<\/i> We may understand\r\n    this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden, because applying it to the skin does not\r\n    lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.). So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentange\r\n    of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is\r\n    high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds\r\n    and the like.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Liqa&rsquo; al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, 24"},{"id":"9328","question_id":"9328","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Firstly, may Allaah reward you with good for following the guidance of\r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for calling\r\n    your family to do likewise.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly, shaving the beard is haraam, and letting it grow is obligatory,\r\n    as you know.

Ahmad was asked about shaving the back of the head and he said: This \r\n    is the action of the Magians, and whoever imitates a people is one of them.\r\n    <b>Thus it is known that it is not permissible to \r\n    leave some parts of the hair longer than others.<\/b><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq &lsquo;Afeefi, Ibraaheem \r\n    ibn Muhammad Aal al-Shaykh. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: It \r\n    has become common among women and men to cut their hair in such a way that \r\n    there is an area that is 10 or 13 cm long, then they shave the hair on the \r\n    sides and back of the head completely, leaving only the hair on the top of \r\n    the head. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the ruling on that and what is the evidence? Does \r\n    this come under the heading of qaza&rsquo; or not? Why?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: There is no doubt that this action is wrong and \r\n    is blind following of others, and it comes under the heading of qaza&rsquo;. It \r\n    was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    forbade qaza&rsquo;; he saw a boy who had part of his head shaved and he said: \r\n    &ldquo;Shave all of it or leave all of it.&rdquo; Moreover, this style is not \r\n    beautification for either men or women, rather it is changing the creation \r\n    of Allaah and spoiling people's appearance, and it is an imitation of the \r\n    West in which there is no benefit, in addition to the cost involved, as it \r\n    involves a lot of effort and spending money on something that is harmful, as \r\n    is well known. We advise men not to adopt this western style and we advise \r\n    women to stick with that which their mothers and grandmothers did, of \r\n    letting their hair grow and braiding it, as this is more beautiful. And \r\n    Allaah is the one whose help we seek; may Allaah send blessings and peace \r\n    upon Muhammad and his family and Companions. End quote from <i>Fataawa \r\n    al-Shaykh Ibn Jibreen<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah preserve \r\n    him) said: The one who cut the hair on the sides of his head and makes the \r\n    hair thick in the middle of the head is included in this, because this is \r\n    imitating immoral people. Some of the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    them) referred to that. We know that some of our earlier shaykhs were very \r\n    strict with regard to cutting some parts of the hair and not others, and \r\n    they regarded that as coming under the heading of qaza&rsquo; and they said: \r\n    Either cut all of it or shave all of it. This is the basic principle we \r\n    should follow, according to the scholars. The Sunnah with regard to hair is \r\n    to shave all of it or cut all of it, not to cut some of it and leave some of \r\n    it, because this is an imitation of corrupt people.

But if \r\n    it is only known among immoral women, evildoers and kuffaar, then it is not \r\n    permissible to adopt this custom because that is imitating them, and \r\n    imitating evildoers is not allowed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the ruling on doing body piercing, i.e., \r\n    piercing various parts of the body in order to wear adornments, the ruling \r\n    on this action is subject to further discussion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If having the piercing done involves uncovering the &lsquo;awrah \r\n    and having a stranger or non-mahram, male or female, look at it, then this \r\n    is undoubtedly a haraam action. The evil of uncovering the &lsquo;awrah is greater \r\n    than any benefit in wearing adornments, because uncovering the &lsquo;awrah is one \r\n    of the things that are definitively forbidden in our religion. And what \r\n    uncovering it leads to of uncovering the &lsquo;awrah and transgressing human \r\n    dignity and the temptation to commit sin is much more serious than achieving \r\n    the purpose of adornment which may be achieved by simply wearing earrings, \r\n    for example.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the piercing will have an adverse effect on one&rsquo;s health, \r\n    whether immediately or in the future, then it is haraam and it is not \r\n    permissible to do it on any part of the body.

Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of \r\ncorn.'&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see Fath al-Baari, 10\/385). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;Shall I not send you on the \r\nsame mission as the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of \r\nAllaah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any built-up tomb without \r\nlevelling it, and do not leave any picture in any house without erasing it.&quot; \r\n(Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaa'i; this is the version narrated by al-Nisaa'i).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that \r\nthe Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n&quot;Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and for every image that he made a \r\nsoul will be created for him, which will be punished in the Fire.&quot; Ibn \r\n'Abbaas said: &quot;If you must do that, make pictures of trees and other \r\ninanimate objects.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, 3\/1871)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese ahaadeeth indicate that pictures of animate beings are haraam, \r\nwhether they are humans or other creatures, whether they are \r\nthree-dimensional or two-dimensional, whether they are printed, drawn, \r\netched, engraved, carved, cast in moulds, etc. These ahaadeeth include all \r\nof these types of pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Muslim should submit to the teachings of Islam and not argue with \r\nthem by saying, &quot;But I am not worshipping them or prostrating to them!&quot; If \r\nwe think about just one aspect of the evil caused by the prevalence of \r\nphotographs and pictures in our times, we will understand something of the \r\nwisdom behind this prohibition: that aspect is the great corruption caused \r\nby the provoking of physical desires and subsequent spread of immorality \r\ncaused by these pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Muslim should not keep any pictures of animate beings in his house, \r\nbecause they will prevent the angels from entering. The Prophet <img>\r\n \r\n(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The angels do not enter \r\na house in which there is a dog or pictures.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see \r\nal-Fath, 10\/380). <\/p>\r\n<p>But nowadays, unfortunately, one can even find in some Muslim homes \r\nstatues of gods worshipped by the kuffaar (such as Buddha etc.) which \r\nthey keep on the basis that they are antiques or decorative pieces. These \r\nthings are more strictly prohibited than others, just as pictures which are \r\nhung up are worse than pictures which are not hung up, for how easily they \r\ncan lead to glorification, and cause grief or be a source of boasting! We \r\ncannot say that these pictures are kept for memory's sake, because true \r\nmemories of a Muslim relative or friend reside in the heart, and we \r\nremember them by praying for mercy and forgiveness for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking pictures with a camera involves human actions such as focusing, \r\npressing the shutter, developing, printing, and so on. We cannot call it \r\nanything other than &quot;picture-making&quot; or tasweer, which is the expression \r\nused by all Arabic-speakers to describe this action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the book Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam, the author says: \r\n&quot;Photography is even more of an imitation of the creation of Allaah than \r\npictures which are engraved or drawn, so it is even more deserving of \r\nbeing prohibited&#133; There is nothing that could exclude photography from \r\nthe general meaning of the reports.&quot; (p. 42, see also Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4\/355).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the scholars who have discussed the issue of photography is \r\nShaykh Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, who said: &quot;Some of them differentiate \r\nbetween hand-drawn pictures and photographic images by claiming that the \r\nlatter are not products of human effort, and that no more is involved than \r\nthe mere capturing of the image. This is what they claim. The tremendous \r\nenergy invested the one who invented this machine that can do in few \r\nseconds what otherwise could not be done in hours does not count as \r\nhuman effort, according to these people! Pointing the camera, focusing it, \r\nand taking the picture, preceded by installation of the film and followed by \r\ndeveloping and whatever else that I may not know about&#133; none of this is \r\nthe result of human effort, according to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them explain how this photography is done, and summarize that \r\nno less than eleven different actions are involved in the making of a picture. \r\nIn spite of all this, they say that this picture is not the result of human \r\naction! Can it be permissible to hang up a picture of a man, for example, if \r\nit is produced by photography, but not if it is drawn by hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who say that photography is permitted have &quot;frozen&quot; the meaning of \r\nthe word &quot;tasweer,&quot; restriciting it only to the meaning known at the time of \r\nthe Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and not \r\nadding the meaning of photography, which is &quot;tasweer&quot; or \r\n&quot;picture-making&quot; in every sense - linguistic, legal, and in its harmful effects, \r\nand as is clear from the definition mentioned above. Years ago, I said to \r\none of them, By the same token, you could allow idols which have not \r\nbeen carved but have been made by pressing a button on some machine \r\nthat turns out idols by the dozen. What do you say to that?&quot;<br>\r\n(Aadaab al-Zafaaf by al-Albaani, p. 38)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is also worth quoting the opinion of some contemporary scholars who \r\nallow the taking of photographs but say that the pictures should not be \r\nkept: &quot;The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.&quot; \r\n(See al-Sharh al-Mumti', 2\/198).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many bad things involved in the making of pictures. Besides the \r\nelement of imitating the creation of Allaah - which is an accusation denied \r\nby many of those who make pictures - reality bears witness to the great \r\nextent of immorality and provocation of desires caused by the prevalence \r\nof pictures and picture-making nowadays. We must remove or blot out \r\nevery picture, except when it is too difficult to do so, like the pictures \r\nwhich are overwhelmingly prevalent in food packaging, or pictures used in \r\nencyclopaedias and reference books. We should remove what we can, and \r\nbe careful about any provocative pictures that may be found. <\/p>\r\n<p>&quot;<em>So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can&#133;<\/em>&quot; \r\n[al-Taghaabun 64:16 - interpretation of the meaning]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhotographs which are essential are permitted - such as those required for \r\nidentity documents, or for identifying or pursuing criminals [e.g. &quot;wanted&quot; \r\nposters and the like - translator's note], or for educational purposes which \r\ncannot be achieved otherwise.

He said, &ldquo;What is this, O &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;My daughters.&rdquo; \r\n          Among them he saw a mare with wings made of leather.&rdquo; He said, &lsquo;And \r\n          what is this that I see in the midst of them?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;A mare.&rdquo; He \r\n          said, &ldquo;What is this on it?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Wings.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;A mare with \r\n          wings?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Have you not heard that Sulaymaan had a horse with \r\n          wings?&rdquo; She said, the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled so broadly that I \r\n          could see his eyeteeth.<span>&nbsp; <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><span><span>The Maalikis, \r\n          Shaafa&rsquo;is and Hanbalis interpreted this as an exemption for making toys \r\n          because of the necessity of educating girls in how to bring up children. \r\n          This interpretation is obvious if the toy is in the form of a human, \r\n          but it is not obvious if it is in the form of a horse with wings. Hence \r\n          al-Haleemi used this report and others to support his argument. He said: \r\n          &ldquo;There are two benefits of that in the case of girls, one immediate \r\n          and one which comes later. The immediate benefit is that they have fun, \r\n          which is one of the most effective means of child development. If a \r\n          child is well taken care of and feels happy and content, his development \r\n          will be stronger and better. That is because joy energizes the mind, \r\n          which in turn energizes the soul, and that has an effect on the body \r\n          and produces physical strength. The benefit which is seen later on is \r\n          that through that (play), the girls learn how to deal with children, \r\n          love them and feel compassion for them, and that becomes second nature \r\n          to them, so that when they grow up and see for themselves the things \r\n          they used to play at, they will find that the compassion they used to \r\n          play at is something very real indeed. Ibn Hajar quoted in <i><span>al-Fath<\/span><\/i> \r\n          from someone who thought that making toys was haraam, and that it had \r\n          been permitted at first but was then abrogated by the general prohibition \r\n          on making images. He responded by noting that the abrogation could have \r\n          been the other way round and that the permission to make toys came later, \r\n          on the grounds that in the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n          with her) about her toys, there is the indication that this happened \r\n          at a later date, because it mentions that this happened when the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) came back from Tabook. So the apparent meaning is that \r\n          it happened later on.

For example, if we see someone committing a crime that is a crime \r\n    against a person&rsquo;s rights, such as a murder attempt and the like, and it \r\n    cannot be proven except by means of a picture, then in that case taking a \r\n    picture is obligatory, especially in cases where pictures could tell the \r\n    full story, because the means are subject to the same rulings as the ends. \r\n    If we use this image-making to prove the identity of a person lest he be \r\n    accused of a crime committed by someone else, there is nothing wrong with \r\n    this either, rather it is essential.

There is no ruling at all concerning these, \r\n          and they do not come under the prohibition at all. Hence the scholars \r\n          who forbid making pictures with cameras on paper (photographs) permitted \r\n          this (video pictures), and said that there is nothing wrong with this. \r\n          Then it was asked, is it permissible to film lectures which are given \r\n          in the mosques? The (scholarly) view was that it is better not to do \r\n          that, because it may disturb the worshippers and because they may film \r\n          things that may not be appropriate, and so on.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>The \r\n          second category is fixed or still pictures on paper (photographs) &hellip;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>But \r\n          the matter needs further discussion if one wants to make these kind \r\n          of permissible pictures.

If he intends something waajib (obligatory), then it is \r\n          waajib. Sometimes pictures may be essential, especially moving pictures. \r\n          For example, if we see someone in the act of committing a crime against \r\n          a person&rsquo;s rights, such as an attempt to kill and so on, and we cannot \r\n          prove it in any way but by taking pictures, then in this case taking \r\n          pictures becomes waajib, especially in cases where pictures may decide \r\n          the case. The means are subject to the rulings on the ends. If we make \r\n          these pictures in order to prove the identity of a person for fear that \r\n          someone else may be accused of the crime, this is also acceptable, indeed \r\n          it is essential.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>But if we take these pictures just to enjoy \r\n          looking at them, this is undoubtedly haraam...

Hence the scholars who forbid making pictures with \r\n    cameras on paper (photographs) permitted this (video pictures), and said \r\n    that there is nothing wrong with this. Then it was asked, is it permissible \r\n    to film lectures which are given in the mosques?

The means are subject to the rulings on the ends. If we \r\n    make these pictures in order to prove the identity of a person for fear that \r\n    someone else may be accused of the crime, this is also acceptable, indeed it \r\n    is essential.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if we take these \r\n    pictures just to enjoy looking at them, this is undoubtedly haraam...<span> \r\n    And Allaah knows best.&rdquo; (See <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/197-199) \r\n    <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn \r\n    Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on \r\n    videotaping celebrations, conferences and seminars?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: If there is the \r\n    hope that people may benefit from the videotaping of the party, seminar or \r\n    Islamic meeting in which there is the call to Allaah, and it is believed \r\n    that this is most likely to serve a good purpose and that this videotaping \r\n    will be good and will benefit the people, then there is nothing wrong with \r\n    that in sha Allaah.

Making them \r\n    is haraam in all cases because it is competing with the creation of Allah, \r\n    may He be exalted. (The prohibition applies) whether the images are on \r\n    garments, carpets, coins, vessels, walls or elsewhere. As for making images \r\n    of trees, camel saddles and other things that do not include the images of \r\n    animate beings, that is not haraam. This is the ruling on image making \r\n    itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for acquiring something on which there is the image of an \r\n    animal, if it is hung on the wall or appears on a garment or head cover that \r\n    is worn, and the like, which is not regarded as handling it disrespectfully, \r\n    this is haraam. If it is on a carpet that is stepped on or on a pillow or \r\n    cushion and the like that is handed in a disrespectful manner, then it is \r\n    not haraam. But does it prevent the angels of mercy from entering that \r\n    house? There is a discussion concerning that which we will mention below, in \r\n    sha Allah. In this regard there is no differentiation between that which \r\n    casts a shadow and that which does not (three-dimensional and \r\n    two-dimensional). This is a summary of our opinion concerning this matter, \r\n    and something similar was said by the majority of scholars among the \r\n    Sahaabah, Taabi&lsquo;een and those who came after them. It is the view of \r\n    ath-Thawri, Maalik, Abu Haneefah and others. Some of the early generation \r\n    said that only that which casts a shadow is forbidden, and there is nothing \r\n    wrong with images that do not cast a shadow. But this is an invalid opinion \r\n    because the curtain that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) objected to because of the images on it is undoubtedly something \r\n    blameworthy, and its images did not cast shadows.

Avoiding any imitations of the non-Muslims is one of \r\n    the important teachings of sharee&lsquo;ah, so as to prevent the identity of the \r\n    Muslims from being assimilated and lost, and so as to preserve its bright \r\n    light which shines forth among the nations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah that Umm Habeebah and Umm \r\n    Salamah mentioned a church that they had seen in Abyssinia in which there \r\n    were images, to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he \r\n    died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those \r\n    images in it.

Once this is understood, it will become clear that for \r\n    a woman to put her picture where it will be seen by righteous and evildoers \r\n    alike on such websites is something that is contrary to Allah&rsquo;s teachings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That opens the door to fitnah (temptation) and evil for the \r\n    woman and for those who see her. How often have we heard and read painful \r\n    stories caused by such things. How many pure and chaste women have fallen \r\n    into the traps of those who do not fear Allah, evildoers who have tempted \r\n    them with sweet words and promises until, when they had had their way with \r\n    them, they turned their back on them and abandoned them with nothing but \r\n    regret and loss, and perhaps shame in this world and in the Hereafter - \r\n    Allah forbid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How many evildoers have tampered with those images and \r\n    reproduced them by modern means, putting the head of a decent woman on the \r\n    body of an immoral woman, then there will be great regret for what she \r\n    brought upon herself and her family when regret is to no avail. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what you have mentioned about some women who \r\n    wear hijab believing that putting their picture in hijab is not forbidden \r\n    according to Islam, if what you mean by hijab is proper shar&lsquo;i hijab that \r\n    covers the face and does not show the face of the woman, then this kind of \r\n    thing is not forbidden in Islam, especially when there is a need for it.

That applies \r\n    whether the images are on a garment, carpet, a dirham, dinar or other coin, \r\n    a vessel, a wall, or anything else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to making images of trees, camel-saddles and \r\n    other inanimate objects, that is not haraam. This is the ruling on the issue \r\n    of image-making.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no differentiation in any of these matters between \r\n    that which has a shadow and that which does not have a shadow.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the summary of our opinion concerning this matter, \r\n    and something similar was stated by the majority of scholars among the \r\n    Sahaabah, Taabi&lsquo;een and those who came after them; it is also the opinion of \r\n    ath-Thawri, Maalik, Abu Haneefah and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the early generation said that it is only that which \r\n    has a shadow that is forbidden, and there is nothing wrong with images that \r\n    do not have a shadow. But this is an invalid point of view, because no one \r\n    doubts that the curtain that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) objected to because of the images on it was something blameworthy, \r\n    and its images did not have a shadow. And we should also bear in mind all \r\n    the other hadeeths which speak in general terms about all images. Az-Zuhri \r\n    said: The prohibition applies to images in general.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i> by an-Nawawi, 14\/81&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have previously discussed the evidence for the prohibition \r\n    on image-making and some of the texts of the scholars concerning that in \r\n    many answers.

If it does \r\n    include that, does this prohibition apply only to a complete image or does \r\n    it also apply to partial images? And there are other such issues concerning \r\n    which the faqeehs and muftis differed as to whether the ruling mentioned \r\n    above is applicable to these modern forms of image-making.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is a matter concerning which there is a considerable and \r\n    well known difference of opinion among the scholars. Some are of the view \r\n    that photographs come under the heading of image-making that is haraam, \r\n    because it is a kind of image-making and because what is produced by means \r\n    of it is an image, so it comes under the ruling on images of which the text \r\n    speaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some scholars are of the view that the reason for the \r\n    prohibition on image-making, which is imitating the creation of Allah, is \r\n    not applicable in the case of photography, because it is merely capturing \r\n    the reflection of a person, so it is permissible and is like looking in a \r\n    mirror and the like.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is not the place to discuss that; rather the aim is to \r\n    point out that there is a difference between saying that there are \r\n    differences concerning the ruling and saying that there are differences \r\n    concerning the application of the ruling in specific cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have discussed the ruling on photography in many answers \r\n    on this site.

The fact that there are two Shaafa&lsquo;i madhhabs, old and new, \r\n    bears witness to that.

The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Shoot, O Bani Adnaan, \r\n          for your father was an archer.&rdquo; Shooting or archery includes by analogy \r\n          all similar actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The second category is games which do not help in jihaad. \r\n          These are of two types.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The first type is games which are specifically forbidden \r\n          in the texts, such as playing with dice as mentioned in the question. \r\n          These games should be avoided by the Muslim.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The second type is games which are neither enjoined nor \r\n          forbidden in the texts.

These come under the prohibition because of the haraam consequences \r\n          to which they lead or because they are a means to something that is \r\n          haraam. If something is the means that usually leads to something that \r\n          is haraam, then we should refrain from it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The second type is games which do not involve anything \r\n          haraam, and which usually do not lead to it, like most of the games \r\n          we see of football (soccer), volleyball and table-tennis etc. These \r\n          are permissible, subject to the following restrictions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1 &ndash; They should be free of gambling, i.e., betting between \r\n          the players.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; They should not form an obstacle to the obligatory \r\n          remembrance of Allaah, or to prayer, or to any obligatory act of worship, \r\n          such as honouring one&rsquo;s parents.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; They should not take up a lot of the player&rsquo;s time, \r\n          let alone taking up all of his time or causing him to be known among \r\n          the people for that, or becoming his job, because then there is the \r\n          fear that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) <i>&ldquo;Who \r\n          took their religion as an amusement and play, and the life of the world \r\n          deceived them.

For example, one person \r\noffers his car for 100,000 riyals, and he issues ten thousand tickets, selling \r\neach ticket for ten riyals, then he makes a draw and one ticket will win while \r\nall the others lose. <\/p>\r\n<p>But if the contest does not require participants to pay money, such as \r\nQur&rsquo;aan-reading contests for old and young, and it does not dictate that \r\nresponses be given on a certain type of paper, then these competitions are \r\npermissible and may be mustahabb (encouraged), because they offer an incentive \r\nto recite the Book of Allaah and learn about its meanings. A similar case is the \r\nacademic competitions where no loss is involved in entering the contest as the \r\nanswers may be given on any kind of paper. <\/p>\r\n<p>Based on the above, we can say that the newspaper competitions which are \r\nwidespread in our media are a kind of lottery, whereby the entrant loses the \r\nvalue of the ticket in most cases, and very rarely wins. Undoubtedly this is a \r\nform of gambling, consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully, deceiving people and \r\nwasting money. One of the editors of one of our newspapers told me that the \r\npaper he edits used to print forty thousand copies daily, of which nearly ten \r\nthousand copies would be returned. After this newspaper started to run contests, \r\ntheir print run rose to 300,000 copies daily, with no copies being returned. \r\nContestants were buying huge numbers of papers, not to read them but just to cut \r\nout the entry forms so that they could enter the contests by submitting more \r\nthan one form. <\/p>\r\n<p>Undoubtedly this is a kind of lottery and is a kind of gambling. I wish that \r\nour brothers who are in charge of our newspapers would fear Allaah with regard \r\nto their country and their countrymen and with regard to their earnings. I wish \r\nthat those who are responsible for the media, those who are in charge of the \r\npress, would take a stand that is in accordance with the Islamic identity of our \r\ncountry and free themselves from blame before Allaah with regard to their \r\nresponsibility to enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil. <\/p>\r\n<p>The same applies to the TV contests which can only be entered by buying a \r\ncertain chip for entering contests, and the draws run by stores via tickets \r\nwhich are only given to those who spend more than a certain amount. This means \r\nthat the ticket has a value which is paid for in the bill, and this comes under \r\nthe heading of a lottery or raffle. <\/p>\r\n<p>Also included with these practices &ndash; contests run by newspapers, TV stations \r\nand stores &ndash; are the deposit certificates which permit entry to contests by \r\ngiving depositors tickets, as mentioned in the question. The reason why these \r\nare included under the heading of lotteries or raffles even though the bank \r\nreturns the deposit in full after the contest has ended is that the deposit has \r\nto remain frozen in the bank until the end of the draw, and this means that this \r\ndeposit is rendered inactive and is not invested in favour of the one who \r\ndeposits it; rather it is invested in favour of the bank and not in favour of \r\nits owner. What the bank takes from its investment of this deposit is equal to \r\nthe amount of money paid by the one who wants to enter the contest in return for \r\nthe deposit certificate, hence this practice comes under the same ruling as \r\nlotteries and raffles. <\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Al-Da&rsquo;wah magazine, issue # 1796, p. 19"},{"id":"9450","question_id":"9450","answers":"<p>The reasons are:<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Wasting of time in something which has no benefit in this life nor in the hereafter.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>This game of cards is based on the idea of gambling, and it resembles playing with dice, which is \r\nclearly prohibited in Islaam, as related in the authentic hadeeth of the Prophet <img>\r\n:<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>&quot;Whoever plays with dice, would (resemble) one who has tainted his hand with the flesh \r\nand blood of a pig,&quot;<\/em> narrated by Muslim (2260).<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>The playing cards include pictures of creations with a soul (the Jack and Queen &#133;).<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>The rancor, enmity, bitterness, and\/or ill-feeling which may occur between the players (shahnaa' \r\nwa-baghdaa').<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>The game promotes cheating, deception, and trickery (ghish wa-tahaayul).<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>It distracts from the worship of Allaah, and from salaat.

If he is only buying it because of the contest then it is not \r\n    permissible, because in that case it is a kind of gambling, as the \r\n    contestant is risking the money that he pays (the price of the newspaper) in \r\n    return for the possibility of winning the contest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if he buys the newspaper not in order to read \r\n    it but only to cut out the coupon for the contest, or he buys more than one \r\n    copy of the newspaper, then his entering the contest is haraam and is a kind \r\n    of gambling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; The price of the product or newspaper should not be \r\n    raised for the sake of the contest. If the newspaper cost 3 riyals then it \r\n    is raised to 4 riyals because of the contest, then entering it is haraam, \r\n    because this extra amount is because of the contest, so it is also a kind of \r\n    gambling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>As&rsquo;ilat al-Baab il-Maftooh <\/i>by Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen (1162).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, your taking part in the contest is \r\n    permissible, because you did not buy the newspaper for the sake of the \r\n    contest, so long as the price of the newspaper was not raised because of the \r\n    contest.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9455","question_id":"9455","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the many types of intellectual games to\r\n    be found all over daily newspapers and magazines are the type of puzzles called\r\n    crosswords, a kind of puzzle that focuses on how well educated and widely read a person\r\n    is.

The Persians were the ones who had defeated the Romans;\r\n    the Romans were Christians, People of the Book, whilst the Persians were Magians\r\n    (Zoroastrians), who had no revealed Book. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;&hellip;\r\n    And on that day, the believers (i.e., Muslims) will rejoice (at the victory given by\r\n    Allaah to the Romans against the Persians).&rdquo; [al-Room 30:4]<\/i>, because the\r\n    believers wanted the Christians to defeat the Persians as the Christians were People of\r\n    the Book and therefore closer to Islam than the Magians. Quraysh, on the other hand,\r\n    wanted the Magians to defeat the Romans, and said, &ldquo;The Romans cannot defeat the\r\n    Persians, because the Persians are stronger than they are, and they do not believe in the\r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan.&rdquo; So Abu Bakr bet them a number of camels that (the Romans) would\r\n    prevail within seven years.

Abu Bakr did this, and before the two\r\n    years had passed, travellers brought news that the Romans had defeated the Persians.

The basic principle concerning all kinds of \r\n    food, drink and clothing is that they are permissible until and unless proof \r\n    is established that they are haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h1>&ldquo;He it is Who created for you all that is on earth&rdquo;<\/h1>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:29]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if anyone says, this drink is haraam, or this food is \r\n    haraam, or this garment is haraam, say to him, Bring your proof. If he \r\n    brings proof then we should do whatever is indicated by the proof. If he \r\n    does not bring proof, then his words are to be rejected, because Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h1>&ldquo;He it is Who created for you all that is on earth&rdquo;<\/h1>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:29]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Everything in this world Allaah has created for us.

This is a misunderstanding of the hadeeth. \r\n    &ldquo;Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is haraam&rdquo; means \r\n    that if a lot of something will cause intoxication, and a little of it will \r\n    not cause intoxication, then a lot or a little are both haraam, because you \r\n    may drink a little that does not cause intoxication, then you may be tempted \r\n    to drink more and become intoxicated.

One of the characteristics of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that he came to permit what is \r\n    good and forbid what is evil.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh &lsquo;Abd \r\n    ar-Rahmaan as-Sa&lsquo;di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Allah, may He \r\n    be exalted, says to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him): <i>&ldquo;They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) what is lawful for them (as \r\n    food)&rdquo; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:4]<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;Say: \r\n    Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibat (all kind of Halal (lawful and good) foods)&rdquo;<\/span><\/i><span> \r\n    &ndash; this refers to everything in which there is benefit or pleasure without it \r\n    being harmful to the body or mind.

It also includes all sea \r\n    animals and all land animals apart from those excluded by the Lawgiver, such \r\n    as carnivores and vermin. Hence the verse implies that khabaa&rsquo;ith (whatever \r\n    is bad and unlawful) are haraam, as is clearly stated in the verse \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;he allows them as lawful At-Taiyibat \r\n    ((i.e. all good and lawful) as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, \r\n    foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaith (i.e. all evil and \r\n    unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.),&rdquo; \r\n    [al-A&lsquo;raaf 7:157]<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Tafseer \r\n    as-Sa&lsquo;di<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    p. 221&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Numerous \r\n    fatwas have been issued by the scholars concerning the prohibition on \r\n    smoking.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The scholars \r\n    of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Smoking is \r\n    haraam because it has been proven that it is damaging to one&rsquo;s health, and \r\n    because it comes under the heading of <i>al-khabaa&rsquo;ith<\/i> (that which is \r\n    evil and unlawful), and because it is extravagance (a waste of money).

He said in <i>al-Fataawa<\/i> \r\n    (21\/102): It is more likely that their cheese -- referring to the Magians -- \r\n    is halaal and that the rennet from a dead animal (one that died of natural \r\n    causes) and its milk are taahir. End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>He also said (35\/154): With \r\n    regard to cheese that is made with their rennet &ndash; i.e., from some of the \r\n    baatini sects who are regarded as kaafirs &ndash; there are two well-known views \r\n    concerning that among the scholars, as in the case of rennet from dead \r\n    animals and rennet from animals slaughtered by the Magians and Franks, of \r\n    whom it is said that they do not slaughter meat properly. The view of Abu \r\n    Haneefah and of Ahmad according to one of the two reports narrated from him \r\n    is that this cheese is permissible, because the rennet of dead animals is \r\n    taahir according to this view, because then it does not die when the animal \r\n    dies. The view of Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, and of Ahmad according to the \r\n    other report, is that this cheese is najis because in their view the rennet \r\n    is najis, because the milk and rennet of the dead animal are najis according \r\n    to them. If meat slaughtered by a particular person cannot be eaten, then \r\n    meat slaughtered by him is like dead meat. Those who hold both views quoted \r\n    as evidence reports that were narrated from the Sahaabah. Those who hold the \r\n    first view narrate that the Sahaabah ate the cheese of the Magians, and \r\n    those who hold the second view narrate that they ate what they thought was \r\n    cheese of the Christians. This issue is subject to ijtihaad and one may \r\n    follow the view of the Shaykh he asks. End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This is the correct opinion. \r\n    Whether you know the source of the rennet and that it comes from an animal \r\n    that was slaughtered properly or otherwise, or you do not know, there is \r\n    nothing wrong with eating cheese that has been made with it.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And Allah knows best<\/span>.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9487","question_id":"9487","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Snails are of \r\n    two types, land snails and sea snails.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It may become \r\n    halaal if the fat has turned (via some process) into something else, so that \r\n    it is no longer called fat and does not have the characteristics of fat. If \r\n    that is the case then it does not come under the same ruling. This is what \r\n    the scholars call istihaalah (process to change a substance to something \r\n    else) and it may be looked at from two angles. That which was good and \r\n    permissible but has become bad and impure, is now haraam, and that which was \r\n    bad and impure but has become permissible and good is now halaal. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ibn al-Qayyim \r\n    said: &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Based on this \r\n    principle, alcohol is impure, even though its origin is pure. If the reason \r\n    for its being regarded as impure is no longer present, then it is to be \r\n    regarded as pure. This is the basis of sharee&rsquo;ah and the basis of reward and \r\n    punishment. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Based on this, \r\n    the correct analogy is that this principle may be applicable to all other \r\n    impurities if they have gone through a process of change. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) removed the remains of the \r\n    mushrikeen from the site of his mosque, but he did not remove the soil. And \r\n    Allaah says of milk that it comes <i>&ldquo;from between excretions and blood&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Nahl 16:66]<\/i>. The Muslims are unanimously agreed that if an animal \r\n    eats impure things, but it is then detained and fed with pure things, its \r\n    milk and meat become permissible. The same applies to crops and fruits: if \r\n    they are watered with impure water, but are then watered with pure water, \r\n    they become permissible, because of the change (istihaalah) in the impure \r\n    thing, which becomes pure. The converse also applies: if the pure thing \r\n    changes into something impure, then it becomes impure (naajis), like water, \r\n    and food when it changes into urine and faeces. So how can the change affect \r\n    it when good turns into bad, but not affect it when bad turns into good, and \r\n    Allaah brings forth pure things from impure things and impure things from \r\n    pure things? &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is not the \r\n    origin of a thing that matters, but what it is now. It is impossible for the \r\n    ruling on impurity to remain when the name and character of the thing have \r\n    changed. The ruling is connected to the name and character, and is present \r\n    or absent depending on whether they are present or absent. The texts which \r\n    deal with the prohibition on dead meat, blood, pork and alcohol do not deal \r\n    with crops, fruits, sand, salt, soil or vinegar, whether in wording or \r\n    meaning or text or analogy. Those who distinguished between the change \r\n    (istihaalah) of alcohol and other things said that alcohol becomes naajis \r\n    because of the process of change, then it may become pure because of a \r\n    further process of change. It was said to them that blood, urine and faeces&nbsp; \r\n    became impure because of a process of change so they may become pure because \r\n    of a further process of change.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined it, then he forbade it \r\n    and said: &ldquo;There is no fara&rsquo; and no &lsquo;ateerah.&rdquo; So the people stopped doing \r\n    that because of the prohibition. It is well known that disallowing applies \r\n    to something that used to be done. We do not know of any scholar who says \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to \r\n    forbid it then he allowed it. The evidence that it was done before it was \r\n    disallowed is to be found in the hadeeth of Nubayshah: &ldquo;We used to offer the \r\n    &lsquo;ateerah during the Jaahiliyyah, and we used to offer the fara&rsquo; during the \r\n    Jaahiliyyah.&rdquo; The fact that the scholars of all regions are unanimously \r\n    agreed to disallow &lsquo;ateerah indicates that they were aware of the \r\n    prohibition. Moreover there are proven reports which indicate that it is \r\n    forbidden. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (R) stated in his <i>Fataawa<\/i> \r\n    (6\/165) that &lsquo;ateerah is haraam.

Even if the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had not \r\n    specifically disallowed it, it would still be disallowed, because all \r\n    matters of the Jaahiliyyah are disallowed and there is no need to state a \r\n    specific ruling on each one of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars stated that it is makrooh, but what we \r\n    understand is that it is haraam. This is with regard to those who slaughter \r\n    the first foal born to a she-camel, or offer a sacrifice in the first ten \r\n    days of Rajab. As for that which they used to do in the Jaahiliyyah for \r\n    their gods, this is shirk. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (7\/325):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The words of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;There is no fara&rsquo; and no \r\n    &lsquo;ateerah&rdquo; (according to another report: &ldquo;There is no fara&rsquo; and no &lsquo;ateerah \r\n    in Islam&rdquo;) indicate that this is a characteristic of the Jaahiliyyah, hence \r\n    some scholars regarded &lsquo;ateerah as makrooh, unlike fara&rsquo;, because some \r\n    Sunnahs were narrated concerning it. But in the case of &lsquo;ateerah &ndash; i.e., \r\n    offering a sacrifice at the beginning of Rajab &ndash; it deserves to be makrooh, \r\n    especially if it is slaughtered at the beginning of Rajab and people have \r\n    been told that there is nothing wrong with it. For people are inclined \r\n    towards such things and the month of Rajab is like the month of sacrifice, \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah. The people do that a great deal, so it has become a symbol and \r\n    ritual. There is no doubt that this is prohibited.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;It seems most likely in my view that there is nothing wring with fara&rsquo;, because it is mentioned in the Sunnah, but as for &lsquo;ateerah, the least that can be said is that it is makrooh.

Some of them said that what is haraam is benefitting from the thing; others said \r\n    that what is haraam is selling it. The latter view is the one which was regarded as correct by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him), who said in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (8\/136):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;This view is the one which is correct: that the pronoun in the phrase &lsquo;it is \r\n    forbidden&rsquo; refers to selling, even though the substance in question has these uses that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) mentioned. \r\n    That is because the context of the hadeeth has to do with selling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And it was said that &lsquo;it is forbidden&rsquo; refers to benefitting from it in these \r\n    ways, so it is not permissible to caulk ships with it, or grease animal skins with it, or to use it in people&rsquo;s lamps. But this view is da&rsquo;eef \r\n    (weak).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The correct view is that it is permissible to caulk ships with it, and grease \r\n    animal skins, and use it in people&rsquo;s lamps.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-San&rsquo;aani said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The pronoun in the phrase &lsquo;it is forbidden&rsquo; is to be understood as referring to \r\n    selling, i.e., that selling the fat is haraam. This is the most apparent meaning, because this is what is implied by the context, and because the \r\n    same hadeeth was narrated by Ahmad, in whose version it says, &lsquo;And what do you think of selling the fat of dead meat?&rsquo; Or it may be interpreted as \r\n    referring to the uses to which it is put, in the phrase, &lsquo;for it is used for caulking ships&rsquo; etc.. The majority interpreted it in this manner and \r\n    said, &lsquo;No use should be made of a dead animal apart from its skin, if it is tanned.&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Those who say that the pronoun refers to selling quote as evidence the fact that \r\n    there is scholarly consensus that it is permissible to feed dead meat to dogs even if they are hunting dogs. It is known that the pronoun is more \r\n    likely to refer to selling, so it is permissible to make use of naajis (impure) things in general and it is haraam to sell them for the reasons \r\n    that are known. This view is supported by the fact that the Prophet (S) condemned the Jews for melting down the fat then selling it and consuming \r\n    its price. So it is clear that the prohibition is directed against the selling which results in the consumption of its price. If the prohibition \r\n    applies to selling then it is permissible to make use of the fat of dead animals and impure (naajis) fats for all purposes except food for humans \r\n    or use on human bodies. (i.e., it is not permissible for a human being to eat the fat from a dead animal or to apply impure (naajis) fats to his \r\n    body). So the prohibition is like the prohibition on eating dead meat or using impure substances on the body. But it is permissible to feed the \r\n    fat of dead animals to dogs or to feed honey that is contaminated with an impure substance to bees. All of that is regarded as permissible in the \r\n    Shaafa&rsquo;i madhhab, and was narrated by al-Qaadi &lsquo;Iyaad from Maalik and most of his companions, and from Abu Haneefah and his companions, and from \r\n    al-Layth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><span>This hadeeth also indicates that if it is haraam to sell a thing, its \r\n    price is also forbidden, and that every contrivance that leads to permitting something which is forbidden is false.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Subul al-Salaam<\/i>, 3\/6.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the hadeeth of Maymoonah, it was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1421) and \r\n    Muslim (363).

When it died, they thought that it was not permissible to make any use of it at all, so they threw it away. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by it with some of his companions and when he saw it, he said to them &ldquo;Why do you not take the \r\n    skin of this dead animal and make use of it?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;It is dead meat.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said to them, &ldquo;What is forbidden is to eat it; with regard to anything other than eating it, such as making use of the skin, that is permissible \r\n    after tanning it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><span>The scholars differed concerning the ruling on the skin of dead \r\n    animals if it is tanned.&nbsp; Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen favoured the view that tanning purifies the skin of the dead animal if it is from an animal whose \r\n    meat may be eaten, such as camels, cattle and sheep. But if it comes from an animal whose meat may not be eaten, such as pigs, then it cannot be \r\n    purified by tanning.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 1\/72.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Shaykh al-Islam said, after quoting the views of the scholars:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The point of confusion has to do with tanning: is it the case that the skin of \r\n    animals which pure when they are alive may be purified by tanning when they are dead or is it the case that tanning can only purify the skin of an \r\n    animal that is slaughtered properly according to sharee&rsquo;ah? The second opinion is more likely to be correct, and the evidence for that is that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade using the skin of carnivores, as was narrated by Usaamah ibn &lsquo;Umayr al-Dhuhali.&nbsp; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and al-Nasaa&rsquo;i.

Even if he is\r\n    put off by something or feels disgusted by it, he has no right to say that it is haraam.\r\n    The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hated the smell of garlic, and\r\n    said: &#147;Whoever eats anything from this unpleasant plant should not approach us in the\r\n    mosque.&#148; The people said, &#147;It has become haraam (forbidden), it has become\r\n    haraam.&#148; When the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard what was\r\n    being said, he said: &#147;O people, it is not for me to forbid something that Allaah has\r\n    permitted; this is just a vegetable whose smell is unpleasant.&#148; (Reported\r\n    by Ahmad and Muslim, 877). The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) explained that the fact that he disliked garlic and told people not to\r\n    come to the mosque after eating it did not mean that it was haraam.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Although the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) disliked the idea of eating lizard-meat, he did not forbid others to eat it, as\r\n    is reported in the following story:<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;Khaalid ibn al-Waleed reported that some grilled lizard meat was\r\n    brought to the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and put in front of\r\n    him. He stretched out his hand to take some, but one of the people present said, &#145;O\r\n    Messenger of Allaah, it is lizard meat,&#146; so he pulled his hand back. Khaalid ibn\r\n    al-Waleed asked, &#145;O Messenger of Allaah, is lizard haraam?&#146; He said, &#145;No,\r\n    but it is not known among my people and I cannot face eating it.&#146; So Khaalid took\r\n    some of the lizard meat and ate it, whilst the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) looked on.&#148; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4981, al-Nisaa'i,\r\n    4242, and Abu Dawood, 3300).<\/p>\r\n    <p>After explaining this answer to you, I want to warn you about something\r\n    that I noticed in your question, where you said that you went to the seafood restaurant\r\n    with a male friend.

Just as there is wisdom in what Allaah has created, there is\r\n    also wisdom in what He has prescribed and commanded (sharee&rsquo;ah). He has forbidden His\r\n    slaves to eat unclean things because if they consume them, these things will become a part\r\n    of them and they will be what they eat. When a person eats, he resembles what he eats, and\r\n    what he eats becomes essentially a part of him. Hence man is more balanced in his attitude\r\n    and behaviour than other animals because he is more balanced in what he eats. Eating blood\r\n    and the flesh of carnivorous wild animals gives a person a wild, devilish character and\r\n    makes him aggressive towards other people, so sharee&rsquo;ah wisely forbids eating such\r\n    foods except when there is an overwhelming reason to do so, such as absolute necessity.\r\n    Because the Christians eat pork, it gives them a kind of harshness and cruelty. The same\r\n    applies to those who eat the flesh of carnivores and dogs &ndash; they take on the\r\n    character of these animals. A devilish attitude is an essential attribute of fanged\r\n    carnivores, which is why they are forbidden as food by sharee&rsquo;ah. Since camels may\r\n    display such a devilish attitude, Islam commands those who eat camel meat to counteract it\r\n    by doing wudoo&rsquo;. Since a donkey-like attitude is an essential attribute of donkeys,\r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to eat\r\n    them.

When a little of this substance\r\n    is added to milk, it curdles and becomes cheese. In some Arabic-speaking regions, people\r\n    call this rennet mujabbinah (cheese-maker), and the stomach (from which the rennet is\r\n    taken) is called kursh if the animal grazes on grass. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The Islamic ruling concerning rennet is that if it is taken from an animal that has been\r\n    slaughtered according to sharee'ah, then it is pure (taahir) and can be eaten. This is\r\n    according to the Hanafis, Maalikis, Shaafa'is and Hanbalis.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    As regards eating rennet taken from an animal that dies naturally, or that was not\r\n    slaughtered in accordance with sharee'ah, according to the apparent meaning of the\r\n    opinions reported from the majority of scholars among the Maalikis, Shaafa'is and Hanbalis\r\n    have said, it is impure (naajis) and should not be eaten. They base this ruling on the\r\n    aayah (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Forbidden to you for food) are: al-maytatah\r\n    (dead animals - cattle-beast not slaughtered)&#133;&quot; [al-Maa;idah 5:3] - the rennet\r\n    becomes impure by virtue of the animal's death, and it is not possible to remove that\r\n    impurity from it. [next phrase is unclear]<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Imaam al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo' (9\/68): &quot;The ummah is agreed that it is\r\n    permissible to eat cheese so long as it is not mixed with anything impure, such as adding\r\n    rennet from a source that is not halaal because it was not slaughtered according to\r\n    sharee'ah. This ijmaa' (scholarly consensus) is the evidence for its permissibility.&quot;<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The second view, which is that of Abu Haneefah and is one of two opinions narrated from\r\n    Imaam Ahmad, is that rennet from dead animals or animals that were not slaughtered\r\n    according to sharee'ah is still taahir (pure). This is the opinion which Shaykh al-Islam\r\n    Ibn Taymiyyah thought most correct in al-Fataawaa (21\/102), where he said: &quot;It is\r\n    more likely that their (the Zoroastrians') cheese is halaal, and that the rennet and milk\r\n    of dead animals is taahir (pure).&quot; Elsewhere in al-Fataawaa (35\/154) he said:\r\n    &quot;With regard to the cheese made with their (some of the kaafir Baatini groups')\r\n    rennet, there are two well-known scholarly opinions, as is the case with the rennet from\r\n    animals slaughtered by the Zoroastrians and Christians, and rennet from dead animals, of\r\n    whom it is said that they do not slaughter their animals properly. The schools of Abu\r\n    Haneefah and Ahmad, according to the other of his two opinions, say that this cheese is\r\n    halaal, because the rennet taken from dead animals is taahir (pure), according to this\r\n    view, and because the (enzymes in) rennet do not die when the animal dies (so, the concept\r\n    &quot;impure containers don't cause the contents of the container to become impure by\r\n    contact&quot; ) applies. The schools of Maalik, al-Shaafa'i and Ahmad, according to the\r\n    other of his two opinions, state that this cheese is naajis (impure), because the rennet\r\n    is impure according to this view, as they see the milk and rennet of dead animals as\r\n    impure. In cases where meat is classified as impure because it is not slaughtered\r\n    properly, the meat is regarded as being the same as dead meat. Both opinions are based on\r\n    reports narrated from the Sahaabah. The first group states that the Sahaabah used to eat\r\n    the cheese of the Zoroastrians, while the second group state that the Sahaabah used to eat\r\n    what they thought was the cheese of the Christians. With regard to this issue, the\r\n    follower (ordinary Muslim) must follow an 'aalim who advises him to follow either of these\r\n    two opinions.<\/big><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"9537","question_id":"9537","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not permissible to celebrate innovated festivals\r\n    such as the Christmas of the Christians, or Nowrooz (Persian New Year) or Mahrajaan\r\n    (Persian festival), or festivals that have been innovated by Muslims such as the\r\n    Prophet&rsquo;s birthday in Rabee&rsquo; al-Awwal or the Israa&rsquo; in Rajab and so on.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It also says (1\/67): It is \r\n    mustahabb for the slaughterer to face towards the qiblah&nbsp; and to make the \r\n    animal also face towards the qiblah, because it is the noblest of \r\n    directions, and because turning to face the qiblah is mustahabb in acts of \r\n    worship, except in cases where there is evidence to indicate otherwise. The \r\n    fact that this is mustahabb is particularly emphasized if it is a hadiy or \r\n    udhiyah. It is narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Offer your \r\n    sacrifices and be of good cheer, for there is no Muslim who turns his \r\n    sacrifice to face the qiblah but its blood and dung and wool will be \r\n    hasanaat that are present on his scales on the Day of Resurrection.&rdquo; And he \r\n    used to say: &ldquo;Spend a little, you will be rewarded a great deal.&rdquo; This \r\n    hadeeth was narrated by &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>, and \r\n    al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and al-Bayhaqi narrated something similar. Although \r\n    the imams of hadeeth suggested that its isnaad is weak, it may be acted upon \r\n    with regard to encouraging good deeds. Hence Ibn &lsquo;Umar and Ibn Sireen \r\n    regarded it as makrooh to eat meat that was not facing the qiblah at the \r\n    time of slaughter. Limiting oneself to saying Bismillaah and letting the \r\n    animal face any direction at the time of slaughter is forsaking that which \r\n    is better, but the slaughter is still valid.

There are still specialists who advise not hastening to accept \r\n    what appears to be the case with regard to genetically modified plants of \r\n    abundant production and the ability to overcome defects and resist disease.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are two main points of view with regard to this issue: \r\n    the first is that which is adopted by American companies and American \r\n    government organisations, which is to allow the use of genetically modified \r\n    plants and marketing of their products. The other view, which is the \r\n    opposite view, is that which is adopted by the European Union, which bans \r\n    cultivation (of genetically modified plants) in its territory and warns \r\n    against its possible consequences.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The matter is still not definitive with regard to its \r\n    effects, because it needs years for the impact to materialise, according to \r\n    specialists. The fact that we have some plants which are more resistant to \r\n    pesticides means that they will be used a great deal, which will pose a \r\n    danger to the environment and human health. The fact that the plant has this \r\n    strength means that it will enter the body of the one that eats it. As is \r\n    well known, the countries that import these plants will never be able to \r\n    plant the seeds of these plants in their lands again. What this means is \r\n    that they will remain under the control and domination of the companies that \r\n    produce these seeds, and this is what will affect the quality of the plants \r\n    produced and will affect the economy of the importing country, as it will \r\n    continue importing and consuming, and not producing independently.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development held a \r\n    conference in Sudan 15-17\/6\/2003 CE, the subject of which was: Evaluating \r\n    the Environmental Impact of Introducing Various Kinds of Genetically \r\n    Modified Plants and Animals.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We will quote from that conference statements which will \r\n    explain this issue, before ruling on what was mentioned in the question.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (on p. 45) Dr. &lsquo;Awad-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah &lsquo;Abd al-Mawla -- \r\n    Prof of Horticulture and Genetics in the College of Agriculture, Khartoum \r\n    University -- says:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What are genetically modified products?<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is a phrase which refers to the products of some crops \r\n    which have been genetically engineered, which means introducing a foreign \r\n    gene to the original genetic material. The foreign gene may come from \r\n    different sources, and is introduced to increase the value and improve the \r\n    genetic qualities of the genetically engineered plant. Usually plants are \r\n    genetically altered for two purposes, namely:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>To reduce the cost of producing \r\n    these plants, by making the plant resistant to disease.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>To improve the quality of the \r\n    product, by improving its appearance or nutritional components with regard \r\n    to qualities that have to do with manufacturing and storage.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Production of these genetically modified products is done \r\n    using genetic engineering techniques. This involves first identifying the \r\n    gene responsible for the desired quality and isolating it, then introducing \r\n    it to the living being (the receiver). After this new gene has been mixed \r\n    with the genetic material of the genetically engineered plant, it is \r\n    possible to increase the number of cells in which the new gene is \r\n    successfully mixed, then by means of tissue planting it becomes possible to \r\n    produce complete plants from the cells, and these plants become genetically \r\n    modified or engineered. Once this gene becomes well established in the \r\n    genetically engineered plant, it becomes possible to transfer it to other \r\n    types of the same crop by using traditional methods of raising plants, by \r\n    means of hybridisation and crossbreeding.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In a paper entitled <i>Genetic Modification: Justifications, \r\n    Benefits and its Impact on the Environment and Society<\/i>, by Dr. Lakhdar \r\n    Khaleefi and Dr. Maajidah Khaleefi, it says (p. 15): <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the field of genetic modification in particular, there is \r\n    a clear difference between American and European law. Whilst American law \r\n    regards genetically modified foods as natural foods that do not pose any \r\n    danger until proven otherwise, European law -- especially French law -- \r\n    regards genetically modified foods as unnatural and a possible source of \r\n    danger until proven otherwise.

He (the \r\n    king) said: Give her Haajir (the mother of Ismaa&rsquo;eel, peace be upon him). \r\n    And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was given a gift \r\n    of a sheep containing poison. And Abu Humayd said: The king of Aylah gave \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a white mule and a \r\n    cloak.

Similarly, it is \r\n    permissible to eat even if we do not know whether it was slaughtered in the \r\n    proper manner or not, because if an action is done by the appropriate \r\n    people, then in principle it is valid and sound unless there is evidence to \r\n    the contrary. If we receive some meat from a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian, \r\n    we should not ask about it and we should not ask how it was slaughtered or \r\n    whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not. It is halaal so long \r\n    as there is no proof that it is haraam, and this is one of the ways in which \r\n    Allah has made things easy for us.

In \r\n    fact the prohibitions basically have to do with meat, but there are some \r\n    other prohibitions, such as the fruit of a tree before four years have \r\n    passed since its planting, or any plant that was planted with another type \r\n    of plant, as mixing plants, like mixed marriages, is prohibited. This \r\n    prohibition applies only to &ldquo;the land of Israel&rdquo; i.e., Palestine.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is also \r\n    prohibited to drink any wine that has been made or touched by a Gentile \r\n    (i.e., a non-Jew).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In fact it is also \r\n    prohibited to eat bread or any other food prepared by a Gentile even if it \r\n    was prepared in accordance with the Jewish food laws.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>There is also a \r\n    prohibition on eating leavened bread during the feast of Passover.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>With regard to \r\n    meat, the rulings are as follows:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(a)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is permissible \r\n    for the Jew to eat clean animals and birds.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>These are animals \r\n    that have four legs and cloven hooves, have no eyeteeth or fangs, eat plants \r\n    and chew the cud.

Pigs are \r\n    forbidden because they have eyeteeth (known as tusks), even though they have \r\n    cloven hooves.

It is also forbidden for the Jew to drink wine that was prepared \r\n    or even handled by a non-Jewish person.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>To a large extent \r\n    these laws led to the Jews becoming somewhat isolated. Daily food affects \r\n    the rhythm of a person&rsquo;s life and controls his social relationships with \r\n    others, because the person who eats food that is different from the food of \r\n    others will find himself separated from them, whether he wants to or not; he \r\n    cannot share their daily life with them. Even those Jews who have tried to \r\n    overcome Jewish isolationism have found it difficult to give up Jewish food, \r\n    because it is not easy for a person to change the food that he is used to.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The necessity of \r\n    having birds and animals slaughtered by a qualified slaughterman according \r\n    to their laws made it impossible for the Jew to live outside of the Jewish \r\n    community.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Reform Jews have \r\n    criticised the food laws, because they prevented the Jews from developing \r\n    and assimilating; they are of the view that these laws do not have any \r\n    religious or moral foundation, so they do not adhere to them.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Jews in Western \r\n    societies have been faced with difficulties in obtaining food that is lawful \r\n    for them, in places where there are no kosher food shops to meet their \r\n    needs.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In Israel the \r\n    Chief Rabbinate has tried hard to implement the food laws in public life, \r\n    such as on airlines and in hotels and restaurants.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The majority of \r\n    Jews in the United States and Soviet Union (more than 80% of them), who form \r\n    the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s Jews, do not apply any of the food laws; \r\n    rather many of them eat pork and no more than 4% of them follow all of the \r\n    food laws.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It is no different \r\n    in Israel, where approximately 30,000 people work in raising and selling \r\n    pigs.

It was understood from \r\n    this that the Rabbinate in Israel wanted to expand its influence and \r\n    dominate the kosher certification process completely.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The conflict \r\n    between the Sephardim (Jews who came from Spain and Portugal) and Ashkenazim \r\n    (Jews who came from Germany and France) is also reflected in the kosher \r\n    certification process.

In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or \r\nelectrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case \r\nthere is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without \r\nproperly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): \r\n<em>&quot;&#133; and forbidden unto you is maita&#133;&quot;<\/em> (al-Maa'ida:3)<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, \r\nsuch as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, \r\nsince it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the \r\nayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): <em>&quot;Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, \r\nblood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that \r\nwhich has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow&#133;&quot;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this \r\ncase the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is \r\npermitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh \r\nAbdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3\/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) \r\n<em>&quot;and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you.&quot;<\/em> \r\n(al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would \r\nnot be permisible.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case \r\nlikewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith \r\nin Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the \r\nProphet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know \r\nwhether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not.

Similarly it is \r\n    permissible to eat even if we do not know whether the meat was slaughtered \r\n    in the proper manner or not, because if the action is carried out by the \r\n    right people then the basic principle is that it is valid, unless there is \r\n    evidence to the contrary.

For this reason it is a definite \r\n    fact that Islam has forbidden blood as a means of nutrition for man. Rather \r\n    this prohibition is a clear sign of the wisdom and purpose of sharee&rsquo;ah in \r\n    purifying the animal by draining the blood from it because blood is one of \r\n    the most evil and unlawful kinds of food, which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent to abolish. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and \r\n    lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits \r\n    them as unlawful Al-Khabaa&rsquo;ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards \r\n    things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:157 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Tabari said in his <i>Tafseer<\/i>: &ldquo; The phrase &lsquo;<i>blood \r\n    poured forth<\/i>&rsquo; means blood that flows copiously.

Al-Maawardi \r\n    said that with regard to blood that is not &lsquo;poured forth&rsquo;, if it has \r\n    solidified in the veins, as in the liver and spleen, then it is halaal, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Two kinds of dead meat and two kinds of blood have been permitted to us&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason why the blood that is &ldquo;poured forth&rdquo; is forbidden \r\n    to us is because of the information that has become well known and well \r\n    established nowadays among the doctors and those who carry out medical tests \r\n    and study microscopic creatures, which is that blood is considered to be the \r\n    optimum environment for the growth of germs. So if a person drinks blood it \r\n    is as if he has drunk a &ldquo;farm&rdquo; for growing germs, in which the germs can \r\n    multiply and grow, producing lethal poisons which, as is well known, have \r\n    extremely harmful effects which result in germs invading the human body \r\n    resulting in the person contracting contagious and lethal diseases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said that cooking the blood and eating it will \r\n    surely kill these bacteria and microbes and put an end to them whilst \r\n    preserving the hoped-for nutritional benefits of the blood, our answer is \r\n    that some of these toxins cannot be altered by boiling and changed in such a \r\n    manner that they become beneficial to the body. There are some that do not \r\n    change at all, rather they remain lethal poisons even after being boiled, or \r\n    the heat may alter them in such a way that they become even more lethal and \r\n    harmful.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the benefits expected by the one who drinks \r\n    blood thinking that it is a nutritious substance that strengthens the body, \r\n    these benefits are non-existent, if we examine the composition of blood. \r\n    Blood is very difficult to digest, so much so that if some of it is poured \r\n    into a man&rsquo;s stomach, he will vomit immediately, or it will come out in his \r\n    stools without having been digested, in the form of a black substance. The \r\n    reason why it is so hard to digest and it turns the stools black is the \r\n    presence of the red substance (haemoglobin) which is basically formed of \r\n    iron. As the blood passes through the digestive tract and as time passes, it \r\n    starts to disintegrate and break down, and thus it also harms the body. If \r\n    it were said that cooking also helps to break down the components of blood \r\n    and make it easier to digest and benefit from its nutritional value, our \r\n    answer is that boiling solidifies the proteins in the blood and makes it \r\n    even more difficult to digest, more harmful and less beneficial.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After hundreds of scientific experiments and huge \r\n    advancements in modern science, carrying out blood tests and precise \r\n    scientific research in this field, it has become indisputably clear to all \r\n    those who are concerned with human health of all nationalities and \r\n    specialties that the great harm done to health by eating blood or cooking it \r\n    and using it all boil down to the fact that drinking blood is ingesting a \r\n    lethal poison. This is clear from the following scientific facts:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Blood is basically composed of two basic elements, namely \r\n    water which represents 90% of the liquid in which the components of blood \r\n    swim (which is known as plasma). The rest is formed of blood cells and other \r\n    elements. The one who wants to drink blood or cook it and eat it does so \r\n    because he wants to consume something with a high or regular nutritional \r\n    value. But these scientific facts prove that he would have to drink such a \r\n    huge amount of blood in order to avail himself of a small amount of blood \r\n    protein and a little bit of iron that it is not worth the risk of exposing \r\n    himself to the dangers that result from that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In brief, blood is the opposite of what people think, it is \r\n    very poor in nutritional values. Therefore the fact that it is forbidden \r\n    does not mean that the Muslims are being deprived of any major nutritional \r\n    benefit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Major harm may result from this small amount of blood \r\n    protein mixed with very harmful and poisonous elements, which means that \r\n    ingesting it poses a great risk and puts a person in danger. Foremost among \r\n    these dangers is the poisonous gas with which blood is filled, namely carbon \r\n    dioxide which flows in venous blood from all parts of the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because the one who drinks blood takes it from the animal \r\n    when it is full of carbon dioxide, which is a gas that kills by \r\n    asphyxiation.

These \r\n    have been defined by experts at the present time as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The electrodes should be placed \r\n    on the temples or on the forehead and back of the head<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The voltage should be between \r\n    100 and 400 volts<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The current should be between \r\n    .75 and 1 amp for sheep, between 2 and 2.5 amps for cattle.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The electrical current should \r\n    be applied for between 3 and 6 seconds. <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (c) it is not permissible to stun an animal that is intended \r\n    for slaughter by using a captive bolt pistol or bolt gun, or by gassing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (d) It is not permissible to stun chickens by means of \r\n    electric shock, because experience has proven that this leads to the death \r\n    of a considerable number of them before slaughter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (e) It is not haraam to eat animals that were slaughtered \r\n    properly after being stunned by using a mixture of carbon dioxide and air or \r\n    oxygen, or by using a non-penetrating bolt gun that does not lead to the \r\n    death of the animal before it is properly slaughtered.

See the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]85669[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle with regard to saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; is that \r\n    it must be done for each individual animal with the intention of \r\n    slaughtering it in the proper manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But in the case of mechanical devices that slaughter a large \r\n    number of chickens within a short time period, the scholars have differed \r\n    with regard to the way of saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; that is essential for the \r\n    slaughter to be halaal. There are several opinions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That it is sufficient for \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; to be said once by the person operating the machine, if it \r\n    slaughters a number of chickens in one continuous time period.

This has been stated in fatwas issued by Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him).<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; when \r\n    using these machines is not possible, therefore it is not permissible to use \r\n    these machine for halaal slaughter.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The more correct view is the first one, for the following \r\n    reasons:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the ruling on mechanical slaughter, in which dozens \r\n    of chickens are slaughtered by machines at the same time, saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    only once? If a person is slaughtering a large number of chickens by hand, \r\n    is it acceptable for him to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; just once, or does he have to \r\n    say it for each one individually?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Answer:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: it is permissible to slaughter using modern machines \r\n    on condition that (the blades) are sharp and that the oesophagus and \r\n    windpipe are cut.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: if the machine slaughters a number of chickens in \r\n    the same continuous length of time, it is acceptable for the person \r\n    operating the machine to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; once when he begins to operate it \r\n    with the intention of slaughtering, so long as the person operating the \r\n    machine is a Muslim or kitaabi (Jewish or Christian).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: if the person is slaughtering by hand, he must say \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; separately for each chicken he slaughters, because each chicken \r\n    is a separate entity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly: The slaughter must be done in the slaughterhouse \r\n    and the windpipe and two veins, or one of them, must be cut.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Bakr Abu Zayd, Saalih al-Fawzaan, &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Ghadyaan, \r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn &lsquo;Abdullah Aal ash-Shaykh&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, 22\/463&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It also says (22\/462): is it permissible to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    when operating the machine which does one repeated movement. Please note \r\n    that what is meant is saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; only once, when starting the \r\n    machine for slaughter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Answer: it is acceptable for the person who is operating the \r\n    machine to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; once when starting it for a number of (chickens) \r\n    with the intention of slaughtering them, so long as the one who is operating \r\n    it is a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Ghadyaan, &lsquo;Abd ar-Razaaq &lsquo;Afeefi, &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn &lsquo;Abdullah ibn Baaz. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in the statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council quoted \r\n    above:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8. The basic principle is that slaughter of poultry and other \r\n    animals is to be done by hand, but there is nothing wrong with using \r\n    mechanical devices to slaughter poultry so long as the conditions of shar&lsquo;i \r\n    slaughter mentioned above in paragraph 2 are met. And it is acceptable to \r\n    say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; once for each batch that is to be slaughtered in a \r\n    continuous session, but if there was an interruption then saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    must be repeated. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the statement of the Council did not specify that saying \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; must come from the one who is operating the machine.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Dr. Muhammad Sulaymaan al-Ashqar said: Saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; in \r\n    the case of a large number, if they are to be slaughtered by hand in the \r\n    Islamic manner, may be exhausting for the slaughterman. For example, if a \r\n    person has the task of slaughtering 1200 chickens per hour at a rate of one \r\n    chicken every three seconds, then he would have to say &ldquo;Bismillah wa Allahu \r\n    akbar&rdquo; 1200 times in an hour which would be exhausting and very difficult, \r\n    and such burdensome difficulty is to be avoided in Islam because Allah, may \r\n    He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;and has not laid \r\n    upon you in religion any hardship&rdquo; [al-Hajj 22:78]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the Fatwa Council in Kuwait, of which I was a member at \r\n    the time this fatwa was issued, stated that when slaughtering a large number \r\n    of poultry it is sufficient to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over them once, at the \r\n    beginning, if the task is to proceed continuously without stopping. If there \r\n    is a pause for some reason, then the slaughterman has to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    again for the remainder.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majallat Majma&lsquo; al-Fiqh al-Islami<\/i>, \r\n    issue no. 10, vol. 1, p. 346.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked \r\n    the following question:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I went to visit the National Poultry Farms and I saw how they \r\n    slaughter the chickens; in the beginning they suspend the chickens so that \r\n    they cannot move, then they pass over the slaughterman who slaughters them \r\n    without saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;. I asked: Why do you not say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;? He \r\n    said: Because I say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; when I enter and I cannot say it for five \r\n    hundred thousand chickens. So when I start I say, &ldquo;Bismillah, Allahu akbar&rdquo;, \r\n    and that is sufficient. I said, Who did you ask? He said: The scholars gave \r\n    me a fatwa to that effect and permitted it. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I do not know, O Shaykh, whether this action is permissible?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: It is essential to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over something \r\n    specific, whether it is one or more. For example, if he lines up a thousand \r\n    chickens then when starting the machine he says, &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;, that is \r\n    sufficient. Then if he lines up another thousand chickens, for example, and \r\n    starts the machine and the knives start moving, it is sufficient for him to \r\n    say, &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; for this batch. And if another batch is lined up for him, \r\n    he should say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: He says, &ldquo;I say &lsquo;Bismillah&rsquo; once and that is \r\n    sufficient&rdquo;?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: Do you mean until the machine stops? No, that is not \r\n    permissible, because &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; must be said over something specific.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: Another question, O Shaykh. We also went to visit \r\n    Astra Farms in Tabook, where they were slaughtering quail. What do they do? \r\n    They hang up these birds, then after hanging them up they pass over a \r\n    machine that sprays water on the birds and stuns them somewhat, then they \r\n    pass over something like a wall on which is written, &ldquo;Bismillah wa Allahu \r\n    akbar&rdquo;, then they go to a machine that cuts off their heads. The person in \r\n    charge said that this is acceptable. Is it acceptable to have the words \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah wa Allah akbar&rdquo; written down?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: All of that is ignorance and now you, may Allah bless \r\n    you, have to report what you and your brothers have seen in a signed \r\n    statement and send it to Dar al-Ifta&rsquo;, and tell them when you saw that, \r\n    whether it was this year or a few years ago, so that you may discharge your \r\n    duty with regard to this matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Questioner: O Shaykh, they say that a group of shaykhs gave \r\n    them a fatwa allowing that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh: No, some shaykhs issued a fatwa saying something \r\n    other than this. Maybe he issued a fatwa saying what I have said, which is \r\n    that he may collect a batch and then turn on the machine for this batch, \r\n    even if he does not say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; for each individual bird. It is similar \r\n    to the case where he sees a flock of birds and shoots them and says \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;, and twenty birds fall &ndash; in that case they are halaal.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Liqa&rsquo; al-Maftooh<\/i>, 35\/27&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What seems most likely to be the case, and Allah knows best, \r\n    is that what the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned about saying \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; for each specific batch of birds being slaughtered, is not \r\n    essential, because saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; once in this case is analogous to what \r\n    is done when hunting. When hunting it is not essential to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    for each specific target; rather saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; is connected to the \r\n    weapon. So if a person said &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over his weapon with the intention \r\n    of hunting, and he catches something other than what he aimed at, it is \r\n    still halaal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here we will quote some useful words from Shaykh Muhammad \r\n    Taqi al-&lsquo;Uthmaani (may Allah preserve him) which confirms what we have said \r\n    above about the principle that &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; should be said over a specific \r\n    animal (or batch) and that saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; just once on the part of the \r\n    person operating the machine is a kind of concession that differs from the \r\n    basic principle, by analogy with what is done when hunting. And he explains \r\n    that there is no point in somebody standing next to the machine saying \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; when he is not actually operating it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said (may Allah have mercy on him):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the issue of saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;, it is very \r\n    difficult when using this method. The first problem is identifying who is \r\n    doing the slaughtering, because saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; is obligatory on the \r\n    slaughterman to such an extent that if a man says &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; then another \r\n    man does the slaughtering, that is not permissible. So the question is: Who \r\n    is the slaughterer in the case of this machine? We could say that the one \r\n    who starts the machine the first time is regarded as the slaughterer, \r\n    because the function of the machine can only be attributed to the one who \r\n    operates it, because machines are not sentient beings to which actions may \r\n    be attributed. So the action is to be attributed to the one who uses them, \r\n    and he becomes the doer by means of the machine. But the problem here is \r\n    that the person who uses the machine at the beginning of the day, for \r\n    example, only starts it once, then the machine continues running during work \r\n    hours, and sometimes runs for twenty-four hours, cutting the necks of \r\n    thousands of chickens. So if the person who turned it on at the beginning of \r\n    the day said &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; only once, is that single utterance of &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    sufficient for thousands of chickens that are slaughtered throughout the day \r\n    after turning on the machine? The apparent meaning of the Qur&rsquo;aanic text \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning) <i>&ldquo;Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on \r\n    which Allahs Name has not been pronounced&rdquo; [al-An&lsquo;aam 6:121]<\/i> indicates \r\n    that each animal should have the name of Allah pronounced over it separately \r\n    and be slaughtered immediately afterwards. From this the fuqaha&rsquo; derived \r\n    rulings which indicate that the name of Allah should be mentioned over each \r\n    animal or for each action.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I mentioned these phrases in my research and I concluded from \r\n    them that the majority of imams who stipulate that the name of Allah should \r\n    be pronounced at the time of slaughter stipulate that it should be said over \r\n    a specific animal, and that it should be at the time of slaughter, and there \r\n    should be no significant interval between saying the name of Allah and the \r\n    act of slaughter. These conditions are not met in the method described in \r\n    the case of machines. If the one who switches it on the first time says \r\n    &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; once, that means that he did not say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over a \r\n    particular animal, and between his saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; and his slaughtering \r\n    of thousands of chickens there may be a lengthy interval that may last for a \r\n    whole day or two days. So it appears to be the case that this single \r\n    utterance of &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; is not sufficient for the slaughter of all these \r\n    animals.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then I saw some slaughterhouses in Canada, where they have a \r\n    man standing beside the rotating knives, continually saying, &ldquo;Bismillah \r\n    Allahu akbar&rdquo;. And I thought: with regard to his saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; carrying \r\n    any weight in shar&lsquo;i terms there are the following problems:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The words &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; should be \r\n    uttered by the slaughterer; this man who is standing beside the rotating \r\n    knife has nothing to do with the slaughter process; he is not operating the \r\n    machine or turning the knife, and the chickens come nowhere near him. Rather \r\n    he is a man who is completely separated from the process of slaughter and \r\n    his pronouncement of the name of Allah does not come from the slaughterer.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>A number of chickens come to \r\n    the rotating knife in a matter of seconds; this man who is standing there \r\n    cannot say the name of Allah over each one of these chickens without \r\n    intervals. <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>This man who is standing is a \r\n    human; he is not an automatic machine. So he cannot do any action apart from \r\n    saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;. He may need to do things that will distract him from \r\n    saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;, and during that dozens of chickens may pass through the \r\n    rotating knife.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is another concern to be noted regarding the topic of \r\n    saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over machines, which is drawing an analogy between \r\n    turning on the machine and releasing a hunting dog. It is not obligatory to \r\n    say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; when the prey animal dies; rather it must be said when \r\n    releasing the dog, and there may be a lengthy interval between the release \r\n    of the dog and the death of the prey, and the hunting dog may kill a number \r\n    of animals after being released once. So it seems that saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; \r\n    once is sufficient for all of them to be regarded as halaal. Ibn Qudaamah \r\n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the hunter says &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over one \r\n    prey (when releasing his dog) but then he catches another, it is halaal, and \r\n    if he says &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; over one arrow and shoots it, then he takes another \r\n    and shoots it (without saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;), what he catches with it (the \r\n    second arrow) is not halaal.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we mentioned above has to do with necessity, and in the \r\n    issue under discussion, there is no necessity. However, if we think of the \r\n    need to produce a large amount within a short time, which is because of \r\n    increased population and the rise in the number of consumers, and the small \r\n    number of slaughtermen, and the fact that sharee&lsquo;ah waived the condition of \r\n    specifying the prey in the case of hunting because it is too difficult, as \r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, and in such cases sharee&lsquo;ah \r\n    allows concessions to ward off hardship, in that case we may compare the \r\n    issue under discussion to the issue of necessity (as in the case of hunting) \r\n    with regard to mentioning the name of Allah, so as to ward off hardship and \r\n    make things easier for people. However, I am not quite certain of this \r\n    conclusion, but I wanted to put it forward for discussion by the scholars to \r\n    decide about it, and I have not issued any fatwa on that basis until now, \r\n    especially when we have a suitable alternative to the revolving knife which \r\n    will meet all of the production needs at the same time. That alternative is \r\n    to remove the revolving knife from the machine and replace it with four \r\n    Muslim men who could take turns in cutting the chickens&rsquo; throats whilst \r\n    mentioning the name of Allah, every time the suspended chickens pass by \r\n    them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is something that I have suggested to a large \r\n    slaughterhouse on the island of Reunion, and they did that. Experience \r\n    indicates that this did not reduce the rate of production at all, because \r\n    these people cut the throats of the chickens within the same timeframe as \r\n    the revolving knife.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from Shaykh Muhammad Taqi al-&lsquo;Uthmaani, <i>Majallat \r\n    Majma&lsquo; al-Fiqh al-Islami,<\/i> issue no. 10, vol. 1, p. 541-544&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Stunning the chickens by means \r\n    of electrocution must be avoided, and it is not permissible for the \r\n    organisation that is supervising slaughter to allow it unless they can be \r\n    certain that it does not lead to killing any of the chickens.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is sufficient for the \r\n    machine operator to say &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo; when switching it on, and that must be \r\n    repeated after any pause.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>There is no point in the five \r\n    men beside the machine saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;; rather this is a waste of time \r\n    that should be put a stop to.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The organisations that \r\n    supervise Islamic slaughter must pay attention to the conditions and \r\n    essential guidelines on the matter, and not be careless in applying them. \r\n    And they should try to arrange for the slaughter to be done by hand instead \r\n    of by machines, in accordance with the suggestion made by Shaykh Muhammad \r\n    Taqi al-&lsquo;Uthmaani. That is so as to do away with problems having to do with \r\n    electrocution and saying &ldquo;Bismillah&rdquo;, and so as to avoid the possibility of \r\n    the slaughter of some of the chickens being done inappropriately when \r\n    passing over the rotating knife, because of differences in size among the \r\n    chickens.

One way is by slaughtering it in the \r\n    prescribed manner to be eaten, if one is able to catch it; the other way is \r\n    killing it with arrows, if one is not able to catch it.

And they are unanimously agreed that meat slaughtered by the People \r\n    of the Book, Jews and Christians, is permissible. They differed concerning \r\n    meat slaughtered by Magians, who are fire worshippers. Therefore the four \r\n    Imams and the majority of scholars are of the view that it is haraam, \r\n    because they classify the Magians with idol worshippers and other types of \r\n    kaafirs, other than the People of the Book. Some of the scholars are of the \r\n    view that meat slaughtered by them (Magians) is permissible because they \r\n    classify them with the People of the Book, but this is a very weak view; in \r\n    fact it is invalid. The correct view is that of the majority of scholars, \r\n    which is that meat slaughtered by the Magians is like meat slaughtered by \r\n    any other mushrikeen, because they are like them in everything except the \r\n    jizyah. Rather the Magians were likened to the People of the Book only with \r\n    regard to taking jizyah from them. The evidence for that is the verse in \r\n    which Allah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>Made lawful to you \r\n    this day are At&#8209;Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah \r\n    has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, \r\n    vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of \r\n    the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours \r\n    is lawful to them<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:5]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So Allah clearly stated that the food of the People of the \r\n    Book is permissible for us, and their food means meat slaughtered by them, \r\n    as stated by Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and other scholars. So what is implied by this \r\n    verse is that the food of kaafirs other than the People of the Book is \r\n    haraam for us. This is the view of all scholars except what is known of the \r\n    odd and weak difference concerning meat slaughtered by the Magians.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Once this is understood, the meat that is sold in stores in \r\n    non-Muslim countries, if it is known that it was slaughtered by People of \r\n    the Book, then it is permissible for Muslims, provided it is not known to \r\n    have been slaughtered in a manner different from that which is prescribed in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. So the basic principle is that it is permissible according to the \r\n    text of the Qur'aan, and we should not turn away from that except if \r\n    something is proven which implies that it is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the meat is slaughtered by any other kaafirs, then it \r\n    is haraam for the Muslims and it is not permissible for them to eat it, \r\n    according to the text and according to scholarly consensus, and it is not \r\n    sufficient to mention the name of Allah over it when washing it or eating \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what some quote to prove their point, that \r\n    report was narrated concerning some Muslim people who were new in Islam, and \r\n    some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that. They said: O \r\n    Messenger of Allah, some people who are new in Islam bring meat to us, and \r\n    we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. This \r\n    was narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with her). Thus it is clear that there is no proof for the one who \r\n    buys meat that comes to the stores and is slaughtered by kaafirs other than \r\n    the People of the Book and says the name of Allah over it, because the \r\n    hadeeth narrated from &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah speaks about Muslims, not kaafirs. So there \r\n    is no proof, because the Muslim is to be regarded as sound and righteous so \r\n    long as nothing is known from him to the contrary. It may be that the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told those who asked him \r\n    to say the name of Allah when eating the meat so as to be on the safe side \r\n    and in order to counter the whispers of the Shaytaan, not because that would \r\n    make halaal the meat slaughtered by them which was haraam. And Allah knows \r\n    best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the Muslim is in those non-Muslim countries and it is difficult for him to obtain meat that is slaughtered in the proper shar&rsquo;i manner, and he is fed up of eating chicken and the like, this does not justify him eating haraam meat and it does not mean he comes under the heading of one who is compelled or forced, according to the consensus of the Muslims. It is essential to pay attention to this matter and warn against carelessness for which there is no reason. This is what seems to me to be the case with regard to this matter which has become widespread. I ask Allah to help the Muslims to do that which is in their best religious and worldly interests and to instil fear of Him and respect for His sacred limits in their hearts and to help them avoid that which goes against His laws.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 23\/13."},{"id":"9587","question_id":"9587","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the meat has been slaughtered by one of the People of the \r\n    Book (a Jew or a Christian) and we do not know the method of slaughter, but \r\n    most people in the country kill meat by means of electric shock or by \r\n    slaughtering it for someone or something other than Allah, it is not \r\n    permissible to eat that meat, on the basis of what is usually the case.

It was said that \r\n    what is meant is shaving the head, or removing any dirt that is on it, such \r\n    as blood etc. So it may be understood that it means it is mustahabb to wash \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz said in <i>al-Fath<\/i> (9\/593): In the hadeeth of \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas that is narrated by al-Tabaraani it says: &ldquo;Remove the harm from \r\n    him and shave his head.&rdquo; So he added the idea of shaving the head after \r\n    saying remove the harm.

You do not \r\n    have to tell the people whom you invite that this is an &lsquo;aqeeqah, and it is \r\n    not permissible for them to make fun of what you are doing, because what you \r\n    are doing is the right thing.

It is obligatory in \r\n    the case of boys because it is connected to matters of purity which are essential \r\n    conditions of prayer.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n \r\n<p>It was reported from Abu Hurayrah: &ldquo;Five \r\n  things are related to the Fitrah: circumcision, removing the pubic hairs, plucking \r\n  the armpit hairs, cutting the nails, and trimming the moustache.&rdquo; (Narrated \r\n  by al-Bukhaari, 5550; Muslim, 257).<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Among the Sunnahs for welcoming the newborn, \r\n  the scholars mentioned that the Adhaan should be recited into the baby&rsquo;s \r\n  right ear so that the first thing he hears in this world will be the words of \r\n  Tawheed, which will have a great and blessed effect on the child. With regard \r\n  to reciting the iqaamah in the child&rsquo;s left ear, there is nothing to prove \r\n  that this is required. (See al-Silsilat al-Da&rsquo;eefah, 1\/491).<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Fourthly:<\/p>\r\n<p>Shaving the child&rsquo;s head then anointing the child&rsquo;s \r\n  head with saffron is very beneficial. Then it is prescribed to give in charity \r\n  gold or silver equal in weight to the hair. This does not have to be done by \r\n  actually weighing the hair; if it is too difficult to do that, it is sufficient \r\n  to estimate the weight and give paper currency equivalent to the price of that \r\n  amount of gold or silver. We ask Allaah to protect us and our children from \r\n  all evil and to keep them safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter. \r\n  May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"9604","question_id":"9604","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<o>\r\n    <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><span>The Sunnah is to\r\n      sacrifice the &#8216;aqeeqah for the new born child.

This may be done by\r\n    choice, or because it is necessary.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Plastic surgery that is considered necessary is that which is done when\r\n    there is a need for it, when something does not look right, when something is missing, if\r\n    there is too much or too little of something, or because something has been destroyed or\r\n    deformed. At the same time, it is regarded as &#147;cosmetic&#148; surgery because it\r\n    results in improved appearance.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Faults may be of two types: physical or congenital faults and faults\r\n    which result from illness. Congenital faults include abnormally turned-out lips,\r\n    hare-lips, twisted fingers or toes, etc. Faults which result from illness include the\r\n    scars left by leprosy or other skin diseases, or scars caused by accidents and burns.\r\n    There is no doubt that such faults and scars cause physical and psychological pain and\r\n    harm, therefore Islam allows people afflicted with them to remove or reduce them by\r\n    surgical means. They cause the kind of mental and psychological pain that allows this\r\n    surgery as an urgent need, where necessity permits something that is ordinarily forbidden.\r\n    Any cosmetic surgery which comes under this heading of need because of the fact that the\r\n    reason for the surgery is causing harm is permissible, and is not considered to be\r\n    changing the creation of Allaah. <\/p>\r\n    <p>To further understand the difference between what is permitted and what\r\n    is forbidden, we will quote the words of Imaam al-Nawawi in his commentary on the hadeeth:\r\n    &#147;Allaah has cursed the women who make tattoos and the women who have this done, the\r\n    women who pluck facial hair and the women who have this done, and women who widen the gap\r\n    between their own or others&#146; teeth for the sake of beauty, changing what Allaah has\r\n    created.&#148; (Saheeh Muslim, 3966).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\r\n    &#147;The woman who tattoos is one who uses a needle or similar implement to prick the\r\n    skin of the hand, wrist, lips or other part of a woman&#146;s body until she draws blood,\r\n    then she puts dye into the wound. It is haraam to do this or have it done by choice.\r\n    Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haraam, whether one does it or\r\n    asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case\r\n    it is not haraam to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing\r\n    between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make\r\n    the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic\r\n    of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file\r\n    them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger&#133;\r\n    It is haraam to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadeeth, and because\r\n    it involves changing what Allaah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood.\r\n    Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look\r\n    beautiful, which indicates that what is haraam is when this is done in the pursuit of\r\n    beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in\r\n    the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allaah knows best.&#148; (al-Nawawi,\r\n    commentary on Saheeh Muslim, 13\/107).<\/p>\r\n    <p>We should point out here that cosmetic surgeons do not distinguish\r\n    between cases of serious need and other cases. Their concern is to earn money and satisfy\r\n    their customers. Materialists and proponents of &#147;freedom&#148; think that man is free\r\n    and can do whatever he wants with his body, but this is wrong; the body belongs to Allaah\r\n    and He can command whatever He wills concerning it. Allaah has told us about the ways in\r\n    which Iblees (Shaytaan) promised to lead people astray, one of which is (interpretation of\r\n    the meaning): <i>&#147;&#145;&#133;and indeed I will order them to change the nature\r\n    created by Allaah.&#146;&#133;&#148;<\/i> [al-Nisaa&#146; 4:119]<\/p>\r\n    <p>There are cosmetic surgical procedures which are haraam and are not\r\n    considered to be excusable; these are seen as tampering with the creation of Allaah for\r\n    the sake of beauty. Examples include: breast enlargement or reduction, and procedures\r\n    aimed at reversing the signs of ageing, such as face-lifts etc. The Islamic view is that\r\n    these are not permitted, because there is no urgent need or necessity for them; rather,\r\n    the aim is to change and tamper with the creation of Allaah for reasons of human vanity.\r\n    This is haraam and the one who does it is cursed because it involves two things mentioned\r\n    in the hadeeth: pursuit of beauty and changing what Allaah has created.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Added to this is the fact that these operations are aimed at deceit,\r\n    and may involves the injection of materials extracted from aborted foetuses. These are\r\n    very serious crimes. Moreover, many of these operations result in ongoing pain and other\r\n    side effects, as the specialists themselves say. (See <i>Ahkaam al-Jaraahah<\/i>\r\n    (Rulings on surgery) by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti).<\/p>\r\n    <p>On the basis of the above, we say to you: if the\r\n    disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe\r\n    embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this\r\n    operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce\r\n    an accidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it, in sha Allaah.

If this is what is meant, then it is better to say \r\n    that Allaah is not shy to speak the truth. <i>Al-Liqa&rsquo; al-Shahri<\/i> (37\/25)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9622","question_id":"9622","answers":"Praise be to Allah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      The Muslim should not believe that any harm may be caused \r\n      by reciting some soorahs of the Qur&rsquo;an; this notion is contrary to the \r\n      words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the \r\n      meaning): <i>&ldquo;Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing&rdquo; \r\n      [Fussilat 41:44]<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing in the books of the fuqaha&rsquo; or scholars, or \r\n    in the reports from the righteous early generations that anyone used to warn \r\n    pregnant women against reading Soorat az-Zalzalah; rather those who had \r\n    memorised the Holy Qur&rsquo;an, both men and women, have always been eager to \r\n    complete the recitation of the Qur&rsquo;an within the period in which they \r\n    usually do that, without any exception.

The fact that it is a spiritual bond may be a source of fitnah\r\n    (temptation or trial), as he may say, &ldquo;he is one of the awliya&rsquo; (close friends)\r\n    of Allaah&rdquo; and so on, which may lead him to shirk (associating partners with Allaah).\r\n    Hence it was followed by the words &ldquo;&hellip; and who put their trust in their\r\n    Lord.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second difference is that a sick person may ask for ruqyah from\r\n    someone who is not qualified to do it, because the latter is not using something tangible\r\n    that can be identified. So the person who has been asked to do ruqyah may do it, and the\r\n    sick person may be healed coincidentally, not as a result of the ruqyah which was not done\r\n    according to sharee&rsquo;ah, but at the same time as the ruqyah is done, so people may\r\n    suffer fitnah because of this, and think that this is a person whose du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s are\r\n    answered and whose ruqyah is blessed, when this is not the case.<\/p>\r\n    <p>For this reason the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said, &ldquo;&hellip; those who do not ask for ruqyah..&rdquo; and did not say\r\n    &ldquo;those who do not seek treatment. Seeking treatment is essential, but it is better\r\n    not to seek ruqyah. However, if a person comes forward and recites something over you and\r\n    you do not stop him, this does not mean that you are not counted among the people\r\n    mentioned in the hadeeth, because you did not ask for ruqyah. By the same token, if you do\r\n    ruqyah for your brother, you are doing him a favour, and this does not rule you out from\r\n    being one of the seventy thousand. Thus we say that the extra phrase reported in <i>Saheeh<\/i>\r\n    <i>Muslim<\/i>, &ldquo;&hellip; and they did not do ruqyah&hellip;&rdquo; is a dubious addition\r\n    that is not saheeh.

Abu Sa&#146;eed (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>A group of the Companions of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they made came near one of\r\n    the Arab tribes. (These people were either kaafirs or very stingy, as Ibn al-Qayyim\r\n    mentioned in al-Madaarij). They asked them for hospitality but they refused to do so. Then\r\n    the leader of that tribe was stung, and they tried everything but nothing helped him. Then\r\n    some of them said, Why don&#146;t you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe\r\n    some of them have something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been\r\n    stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you have something?\r\n    One of them said, Yes, by Allaah. I will perform ruqyah for him, but by Allaah we asked\r\n    you for hospitality and you did not give us anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for\r\n    you unless you give us something in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he\r\n    started to blow on him and recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-&#145;Aalameen. Then he\r\n    recovered quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong with\r\n    him. Then they have them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the Sahaabah) said,\r\n    Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said, Do not do anything until we\r\n    come to the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and tell him what\r\n    happened, and we will wait and see what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger\r\n    of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He\r\n    said, &#147;How did you know that it is a ruqyah?&#148; Then he said, &#147;You did the\r\n    right thing. Share them out, and give me a share.&#148; And the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2276, and by\r\n    Muslim, 2201).<\/p>\r\n    <p>There follow some quotes from the commentary of Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar\r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) on the hadeeth and some additional details.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;They asked them for hospitality&#148; means they asked them to\r\n    regard them as guests. According to the report of Al-A&#146;mash narrated by scholars\r\n    others than al-Tirmidhi, it says: &#147;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) sent thirty of us and we camped near some people and asked them for a\r\n    hospitable reception.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;was stung&#148; means, he was stung by a scorpion.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;and they tried everything&#148; means, they tried every kind of\r\n    treatment that they usually did to treat him for the scorpion sting, they made the utmost\r\n    effort to find the right treatment for him.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;So they went to them&#148;. In the hadeeth of Jaabir, al-Bazzaar\r\n    added: &#147;And said to them, We have heard that your companion has come with light and\r\n    healing. They said, Yes.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;Do any of you have something?&#148; Abu Dawood added in his\r\n    report: &#147;that could help our companion.&#148; <\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;One of them said&#148; According to the report of Abu Dawood:\r\n    &#147;A man among the people said, Yes, I will perform ruqyah.&#148; The one who said this\r\n    was Abu Sa&#146;eed, the narrator of the report. His wording was: &#147;I said, Yes, I\r\n    (have something). But I will not perform ruqyah for him until you give us some\r\n    sheep.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This also appears in the report of Sulaymaan ibn Qattah, with the\r\n    words: &#147;I came to him and performed ruqyah for him by reciting the Opening of the\r\n    Book [al-Faatihah].&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;So they agreed&#148; means, they reached an agreement<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;on a flock of sheep&#148;&#133; according to the report of\r\n    al-A&#146;mash: &#147;They said, we will give you thirty ewes.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;then he started to blow on him&#148; means, he blew or spat\r\n    lightly on him, with little saliva.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abi Hamzah said: the blowing in ruqyah should come after the\r\n    recitation, so as to carry the barakah (blessing) of the recitation to the parts of the\r\n    body over which the saliva passes, so that the barakah travels in his saliva when he\r\n    blows. <\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-&#145;Aalameen&#148; According\r\n    to the report of Shu&#146;bah: &#147;He started to recite the Opening of the Book over\r\n    him.&#148; According to the report of Al-A&#146;mash, he recited it seven times.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;Then he recovered quickly&#148;. The meaning of nashata\r\n    (translated here as &#147;recovered&#148;) is: he got up quickly. From the same root comes\r\n    the expression <i>rajul nasheet<\/i>, meaning an active and energetic man.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;from his complaint&#148; The word &#145;iqaal (translated here as\r\n    &#147;complaint&#148;) could refer to the rope used to tie the foreleg of an animal.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;and there was nothing wrong with him&#148; means, his problem was\r\n    gone. A problem may be described as qalabah (wa maa bihi min qalabah &#150; translated\r\n    here as &#147;and there was nothing wrong with him&#148;) because the one who is suffering\r\n    from the problem may be turned (yuqallab) this way and that in order to find out where the\r\n    problem is coming from.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;How did you know that it is a ruqyah?&#148; Al-Daawoodi said: it\r\n    means, what told you &#133;? In the report of Ma&#146;bad ibn Seereen it says: &#147;And\r\n    what told him?&#148; This is something which is said to express astonishment and also\r\n    admiration of a thing, which is quite appropritae in this case. Shu&#146;bah added in his\r\n    report: And it was not mentioned that he &#150; i.e., the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) &#150; disapproved of it. Sulaymaan ibn Qattah added in his report,\r\n    after the phrase &#147;How did you know that it is a ruqyah?&#148;, &#147;I said: it came\r\n    to me like an inspiration&#148; i.e., I was inspired to do it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&#147;and give me a share&#148; means, give me some of them &#150; as\r\n    if he wanted to be extra friendly towards them. <\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to perform ruqyah by\r\n    reciting the Book of Allaah, and that it comes under the same category as dhikr and\r\n    al-du&#146;aa&#146; al-ma&#146;thoor (du&#146;aa&#146;s reported in the Qur&#146;aan and\r\n    Sunnah), and also other du&#146;aa&#146;s so long as they do not contradict what is in the\r\n    Qur&#146;aan and Sunnah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth also indicates that one may respond in kind to a person who\r\n    does not treat one honourably, as the Sahaabah did by withholding the ruqyah from those\r\n    people who had not shown them hospitality.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth also indicates that in the absence of a specific text, one\r\n    may make ijtihaad. It also demonstrates the esteem in which the Qur&#146;aan was held in\r\n    the hearts of the Sahaabah, especially Soorat al-Faatihah, and it shows that if provision\r\n    (rizq) is decreed for someone, the person in whose hands it is cannot withhold it from\r\n    him. Those people withheld their hospitality but Allaah had decreed that the Sahaabah\r\n    should have a share of their wealth, and they withheld it, so Allaah caused the scorion to\r\n    sting their chief so that the Sahaabah would get what had been decreed for them. It also\r\n    demonstrates the great wisdom of Allaah in that the one who was singled out for punishment\r\n    was their leader who had been foremost in withholding hospitality, because people usually\r\n    follow the commands of their leaders. Since he has led them in withholding hospitality, he\r\n    was singled out for the punishment whereas his people were not, which was a most fitting\r\n    punishment.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In al-Mawsoo&#146;ah al-Fiqhiyyah it says: <\/p>\r\n    <p>There is no dispute among the fuqahaa concerning the fact that it is\r\n    permissible for a Muslim to perform ruqyah for a kaafir. They take as evidence the hadeeth\r\n    of Abu Sa&#146;eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) which has been quoted above\r\n    (f &#150; 14). &#133; Their evidence is that the tribe near whom they camped and from whom\r\n    they sought hospitality were kuffaar, and the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) did not denounce that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"9638","question_id":"9638","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is Sunnah to learn ruqyah as prescribed in\r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, seeking to benefit the Muslims and treat these chronic diseases, because\r\n    the Book of Allaah is a beneficial healing.

This problem is more serious if the one who \r\n    is performing ruqyah is one of the People of the Book, who are people of \r\n    shirk.

The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Return trusts to \r\n          those who entrusted you with them.&rdquo; The texts indicate that it is obligatory \r\n          to take care of things that have been entrusted to you, and that it \r\n          is obligatory to return them to their owners in good condition. This \r\n          general meaning includes items that are loaned, because the borrower \r\n          is entrusted with them and is expected to return them. He is permitted \r\n          to benefit from them within the limits dictated by custom, but he is \r\n          not permitted to be extravagant in his use of them in such a way that \r\n          he destroys them, or to use them in a way for which they were not designed \r\n          to be used, because the owner did not give him permission to use them \r\n          in that way, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>&ldquo;Is there any reward for good other than good?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>[al-Rahmaan 55:60]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          If the borrower uses it for something other than the \r\n          purpose for which he borrowed it, and it is destroyed, then he is responsible \r\n          for it, because the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The one who borrows \r\n          is responsible for what he borrows until he returns it.&rdquo; (Narrated by \r\n          the five, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani). This indicates that \r\n          it is obligatory to return what one has taken of another person&rsquo;s property, \r\n          and that he is not free of responsibility until he has given it back \r\n          to its owner or the owner&rsquo;s deputy.<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;If it is destroyed whilst being used in the proper \r\n          manner, the borrower is not to be held accountable for that, because \r\n          the lender gave him permission to use it, and if that happens to an \r\n          item that he has been permitted to use, then he is not to be held accountable \r\n          for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          However, the scholars differed as to whether the borrower \r\n          is held to be responsible for something that is destroyed whilst he \r\n          was using it for a purpose other than that for which it was borrowed. \r\n          One group said that he is to be held accountable for it whether he abused \r\n          it or not, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;The one who borrows is \r\n          responsible for what he borrows until he returns it.&rdquo; This would apply \r\n          in cases where an animal dies, a garment gets burned or a borrowed item \r\n          is stolen. Another group said that he is not to be held accountable \r\n          for it if he did not abuse it, because a person cannot be held accountable \r\n          if he did not abuse it. Perhaps this view is more correct, because the \r\n          borrower takes it with the permission of the owner, so it is a trust \r\n          for him, like something with which one is entrusted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The borrower has to look after the loaned item, take \r\n          care of it and hasten to return it to its owner when he no longer has \r\n          any need of it. He should not be negligent concerning the item, or expose \r\n          the item to the risk of destruction, because it is a trust and because \r\n          the owner has done him a favour, and &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>&ldquo;Is there any reward for good other than good?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>[al-Rahmaan 55:60 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>. \r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source: From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzan Aal Fawzaan"},{"id":"9649","question_id":"9649","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whoever \r\n    borrows something must return it to the owner, whether it is great or small, \r\n    important or insignificant, fulfilling the trust as enjoined by Allaah \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Verily, \r\n    Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they \r\n    are due&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; \r\n    4:58]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;A trust \r\n    belongs to the one who entrusted it to you.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1264) \r\n    and Abu Dawood (3534); classed and saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh<\/i> <i>\r\n    al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What you \r\n    must do is return these tapes to their owners, or get in touch with them and \r\n    ask them to let you off.

This is subject to the conditions that only one such claim is made \r\n          and that it is possible that the child belongs to him.

Al-luqtah is property that has gone\r\n    missing from its owner. This pure religion teaches that property is to be protected and\r\n    preserved, and that the property of the Muslim is sacred and is to be protected. This\r\n    includes al-luqtah or lost property. <\/p>\r\n    <p>If property goes missing from its owner, it has to be one of the\r\n    following three scenarios:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The first scenario: it is something to which most people would not\r\n    attach much value, such as a whip, or a loaf of bread, or some fruit, or a stick. In these\r\n    cases, the person who finds the property may keep it and use it without having to announce\r\n    it, because of the report narrated by Jaabir, who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made exceptions in the case of a stick or a\r\n    whip or a rope that a man picks up.&rdquo; (Reported by Abu Dawood).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second scenario: (animals) that are unlikely to be\r\n    harmed by small predators, either because of their size, such as camels, horses, cattle\r\n    and mules, or because they can fly, like birds, or because they move swiftly, like\r\n    gazelles, or because they can defend themselves with their fangs, like leopards. This is\r\n    the category which it is haraam to keep. These things do not become the property of the\r\n    finder after he announces it for a year, because when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) was asked about a lost camel, he said: &ldquo;What has it got to do\r\n    with you? It has its water, it can walk to find water and it can eat trees until its owner\r\n    finds it.&rdquo; (Agreed upon). &lsquo;Umar said, &ldquo;Whoever takes\r\n    a lost animal is misguided&rdquo; i.e., he is a sinner. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) ruled in this hadeeth that the lost animal should not be taken, it\r\n    should be left to find its own water and to eat from the trees until its owner comes\r\n    across it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>This also applies to large implements, such as big pans, wood, iron and\r\n    anything that can be left alone without getting damaged. Such things can hardly be lost\r\n    and cannot move from where they are, so it is haraam to take them just as it is haraam to\r\n    take lost large animals, and in fact it may be more haraam to do so.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The third scenario: any other kind of lost property, such as money,\r\n    luggage, and any animals that need to be protected from small predators, such as sheep,\r\n    young camels and calves. If the one who finds them can trust himself not to harm or damage\r\n    these things, then it is permissible for him to pick them up. These things are of three\r\n    types:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The first type: animals that are eaten, such as young camels, sheep,\r\n    chickens, The one who finds these must do what is in the best interests of the owner,\r\n    which may be one of three things:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>He can eat it, in which case he owes the price of the animal straight\r\n        away.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>He may sell it and keep the price of it to give to the owner once he has\r\n        claimed it by describing the animal.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>He may keep it and spend on it from his own wealth, but he does not own\r\n        it, and he can claim back what he has spent on it if the owner comes and claims the animal\r\n        back, because when the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked\r\n        about the sheep, he said: &ldquo;Take it, because either it is for you, or your brother, or\r\n        the wolf.&rdquo; (Agreed upon). The meaning is that the sheep is weak\r\n        and is vulnerable to attack, so either you take it, or your brother takes it, or the wolf\r\n        will eat it.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said in his discussion of the hadeeth: &ldquo;This\r\n    includes permission to take lost sheep, and if the owner of the sheep does not come to\r\n    claim it, then it belongs to the one who found it. Then he has the choice to eat it\r\n    immediately, and then he will owe the price of it, or he can sell it and keep the price,\r\n    or he can keep it and spend on it from his own money. The scholars agreed that if the\r\n    owner comes before the finder eats it, he has the right to take it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second type: things that could become spoiled, such as watermelons\r\n    and fruits. The finder in this case should do what is in the owner&rsquo;s best interests,\r\n    whether this is eating it and paying for its value, or selling it and keeping its price\r\n    until the owner comes.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The third type: all other kinds of wealth that are not covered by the\r\n    first two types, such as money and vessels. All of these must be kept as a trust and\r\n    announcements should be made in the places where people gather.<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>It is not permissible for anyone to pick up any kind of lost property\r\n        unless he can be sure that he will deal with it properly and that he is able to make the\r\n        necessary announcements, because of the hadeeth of Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani (may Allaah\r\n        be pleased with him), who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n        Allaah be upon him) was asked about lost gold and silver. He said, &lsquo;Know the details\r\n        of the purse and the string, then announce it for a year. If no one claims it, then\r\n        dispose of it, and it is like a trust in your hands. Then if the owner comes along some\r\n        day, give it to him.&rdquo; He was asked about the sheep, and he said, &ldquo;Take it,\r\n        because either it is for you, or your brother, or the wolf.&rdquo; He was asked about lost\r\n        camels, and he said, &ldquo;What has it got to do with you? It has its water, it can walk\r\n        to find water and it can eat trees until its owner finds it.&rdquo; (Agreed upon).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      \r\n      <li><p>The meaning of the phrase &ldquo;Know the purse and the string&rdquo;\r\n        refers to the kind of purse or wallet that money is kept in and the way it is fastened or\r\n        tied up.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The meaning of the phrase &ldquo;then announce it for a year&rdquo; is\r\n        that it should be mentioned to people in the places where they gather, such as in market\r\n        places and by the doors of the mosque etc. &ldquo;A year&rdquo; means for one full year. In\r\n        the first week after it is found, it should be announced every day, because it is more\r\n        likely that the owner will come in that first week. After that it should be announced as\r\n        often as is customary among the people.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <p>This was the method of announcing lost property in the past. Nowadays\r\n      people should make lost and found announcements in whatever way is appropriate. What\r\n      matters is achieving the desired result, so one must do whatever it takes to return\r\n      property to its rightful owner.<\/p>\r\n      <li><p>The hadeeth indicates that it is obligatory to know exactly what the\r\n        lost property is. The phrase &ldquo;Know the purse and the strings&rdquo; indicates that it\r\n        is obligatory to know what it looks like, so that if the owner comes and describes it\r\n        properly, it can be given to him, but if his description is at odds with the true\r\n        description, then it is not permissible to give it to him.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The phrase &ldquo;If no one claims it, then dispose of it&rdquo; indicates\r\n        that the finder takes possession of the property after one year has passed and after\r\n        announcing it, but he should not dispose of it before he knows exactly what it is, i.e.,\r\n        until he knows &ldquo;the purse and the string&rdquo;, and he knows its value, nature and\r\n        description. If the original owner comes along some time later, and describes it\r\n        accurately, he should then give it to him, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n        Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If someone comes looking for it some day, then give it to\r\n        him.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>The above discussion makes it clear that there are certain obligations\r\n    with regard to lost property:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>When it is found, the finder should not take it unless he is certain\r\n        that he can be trusted to keep it and is able to make the necessary announcements until he\r\n        finds the owner. Whoever does not feel that he can trust himself to do this is not allowed\r\n        to pick it up. If he does pick it up, then he is like one who takes something wrongfully,\r\n        because he took the property of someone else in a manner that is not permissible, and\r\n        because by taking it he is causing the property of another person to be lost.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Before he takes it, he must be sure of its exact details, by knowing its\r\n        &ldquo;purse and string&rdquo;, and its value, type and appearance. What is meant by its\r\n        &ldquo;purse&rdquo; is knowing the appearance of the container it is in, whether it is a bag\r\n        or a cloth, and what is meant by its &ldquo;string&rdquo; is what it is tied up with,\r\n        because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded this, and a\r\n        command implies that something is obligatory. <\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>It must be announced for a whole year, every day in the first week and\r\n        then as frequently as is customary.

The announcements should be made in places\r\n        where people gather, such as in marketplaces or at the doors of mosques at prayer time.\r\n        Announcements should not be made in the mosques themselves, because the mosques are not\r\n        built for that, and the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n        &ldquo;Whoever hears a man making an announcement about lost property in the mosque, let\r\n        him say, &lsquo;May Allaah never return it to you!&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>If someone comes looking for it and describes it properly, it must be\r\n        given to him without asking him for proof or to swear an oath, because of the command of\r\n        the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to that effect, and because his\r\n        precise description is sufficient in the place of proof or an oath.

Some scholars said that the finder can keep it because of the general meaning\r\n    of the hadeeth; others said that he cannot keep it, and the search to identify the owner\r\n    should continue indefinitely, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) said concerning Makkah, &ldquo;It is not permissible for anyone to keep lost property\r\n    found there except the one who claims it by identifying it properly.&rdquo; Shaykh al-Islam\r\n    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured the latter opinion, and said:\r\n    &ldquo;He should not keep it at all, because that is forbidden, and it should be announced\r\n    indefinitely in a search to identify the owner.&rdquo; This is the apparent meaning of the\r\n    report which says it is forbidden.<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>Al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi<\/i> by Saaalih al-Fawzaan, 150.

On this basis, we say to this brother: you have\r\n    to announce it in Makkah, in and around the place where you found it, such as at the doors\r\n    of the mosque and in places where people gather, otherwise you should hand it in to those\r\n    whose job it is to take care of lost property etc. <i>Fatawa Islamiyah<\/i>, 2\/311. <\/p>\r\n    <p>And All&acirc;h knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Fatawa Islamiyah, 2\/311."},{"id":"9665","question_id":"9665","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>What you and anyone else who finds valuable\r\n    lost property should do is to announce it for one full year in the places where people\r\n    gather, two or three times each month.

An exception is made in\r\n    the case of lost property found in Al-Haramayn (Makkah and Madeenah) &ndash; the finder\r\n    cannot keep it, and it should be announced indefinitely until its owner is found, or the\r\n    finder can hand it over to the authorities in charge of the Haramayn so that they can keep\r\n    it for the owner, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said\r\n    concerning Makkah, &ldquo;Property lost in Makkah is not permissible for anyone except its\r\n    owner.&rdquo; And the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;I\r\n    have made Madeenah sacred just as Ibraaheem made Makkah sacred.&rdquo; The authenticity of\r\n    the Hadeeth is agreed upon.<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if the property is of insignificant value and the owner\r\n    will not be bothered about it, such as a rope or shoelace or a small amount of money, then\r\n    the finder does not have to announce it, and he can make use of it or give it in charity\r\n    on behalf of the owner.

Scientific and specialized studies have shown that \r\n          men&rsquo;s minds are more perfect than those of women, and reality and experience \r\n          bear witness to that.

Therefore the righteous \r\n          women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard \r\n          in the husband&rsquo;s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their \r\n          chastity and their husband&rsquo;s property)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>[al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:34]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>Nevertheless, there \r\n          are some women who are far superior to men in their reason and insight, \r\n          but they are few, and the ruling is based on the majority and the usual \r\n          cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          A woman may compensate for her weaknesses by striving \r\n          hard, and surpass men when they are negligent. Hence we find that in \r\n          some colleges, female students surpass male students because of their \r\n          greater efforts and their keenness to succeed when many of the male \r\n          students are negligent and are not eager to learn.

Still, Allaah has given women pre-eminence and \r\n          has favoured them over men in some aspects, such as caring for children, \r\n          and showing patience, love and compassion towards them, and managing \r\n          the home.

It is well known that the one who guides others to do good is \r\n    like the one who does it, and that the one who calls others to guidance will \r\n    have a reward like that of those who follow him, as Muslim (2674) narrated \r\n    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever calls others to \r\n    guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow it, without that \r\n    detracting from their reward in the slightest.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Muslim (1893) narrated from Abu Mas&rsquo;ood al-Ansaari (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The one who tells another about \r\n    something good is like the one who does it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a Muslims writes some advice about the adhkaar for morning \r\n    and evening, for example, and sends it to a hundred people, and many of them \r\n    follow his advice, then he will have a great reward for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we should make use of these means of communication and \r\n    raise the level of the messages that are transmitted through them, so that \r\n    they will be most effective and beneficial. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But unfortunately some people mix this good deed with a bad \r\n    deed, which is a kind of lying and falsehood, such as saying, &ldquo;If you \r\n    forward this, you will hear some good news&rdquo;! This is a kind of \r\n    fortune-telling. There is no shar&rsquo;i evidence that the one who receives \r\n    advice and passes it on to another will hear good news, rather he may hear \r\n    bad news, or good news, or he may not hear anything at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to the one who says, &ldquo;I am entrusting you \r\n    with this to forward it and spread it, or else you will be sinning if you do \r\n    not do that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Such and such will happen to the one who does not forward \r\n    it.&rdquo; All of this is false and there is no basis for it. The one to whom it \r\n    is sent does not have to do anything and there is nothing to oblige him to \r\n    forward it, and he is not sinning if he does not do that. There is no basis \r\n    for stating that someone is sinning without any proof from sharee&rsquo;ah, and \r\n    there is no basis for speaking of the unseen future which no one knows \r\n    except Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Stating that reward or punishment will come as the result of \r\n    actions done is something that must be referred to Allaah. Whatever He has \r\n    permitted is what is halaal, and whatever He has forbidden is what is \r\n    haraam, and reward and punishment are in His hand.

Perhaps one aspect of the religion has \r\n    distracted him from another aspect. He should be reminded of the aayah in \r\n    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

You do not have to obey your parents \r\n    in giving that up, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Obedience is only with regard to what is good and \r\n    proper.&rdquo; But it is prescribed for you to explain that to them in a kind and \r\n    polite manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    5\/412&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your husband could obey his parents and return to his country \r\n    if there is someone who could take his place in working for Islam there and \r\n    if there is also a need to work for Islam in the country where his family \r\n    is. In this manner he can do two things at once, fulfilling his father&rsquo;s \r\n    wishes and also working for Islam. His own country may be in greater need, \r\n    and his staying in the country where he is now may not allow him to practise \r\n    Islam openly or raise his children in Islam.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;But if your husband will be coming back to work in his \r\n    specialty without working for Islam, then you should be on his side and \r\n    encourage him to stay and work for Islam.

Some people will even sit by a scholar whilst he is praying &ndash; \r\n    for example &ndash; and take note of every single movement. When Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) grew old, he did not sit muftarishan (sitting on \r\n    the left foot and holding the right foot upright with the toes pointing \r\n    towards the qiblah) in the prayer.

The same applies to the \r\n    Sunnah, and to makrooh actions.

They benefit from the caller&rsquo;s behaviour, good attitude and \r\n    righteous deeds in ways they cannot benefit from their words which they may \r\n    not understand. One of the most important missions of the one who calls \r\n    people to Allaah is to have a good track record, to be a person of righteous \r\n    deeds, to have a good attitude so that his example may be followed in his \r\n    actions, words and deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This verse encourages and urges us to call people to Allaah, \r\n    and explains the status of the callers (daa&rsquo;iyahs): they are the best of \r\n    people in word if they are sincere in what they say, and do righteous deeds; \r\n    they are the best of people in word and no one is better than them in word \r\n    at all.

Ahl al-Sunnah (those who adhere to the Sunnah) do not label \r\n    anyone as a kaafir merely because of a sin that he commits, even if it is a \r\n    major sin.

Rather it gives her her rights and holds her \r\n    in high esteem. Women were treated as chattels and objects before Allaah honoured mankind with Islam. Women would be inherited like goods and \r\n    chattels, and could be left suspended, being neither married nor divorced. A woman would have to wait for a year after her husband&rsquo;s death, \r\n    neither washing nor going out of the house, until birds and animals would die from her foul smell! Women were not allowed to inherit, let alone \r\n    the fact that they could be buried alive, and many other things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Then Islam came and forbade burying females alive; it regarded that as murder, \r\n    which is a major sin. It forbade leaving women suspended as a result of vows or making one's wife haraam by means of zihaar [a jaahili form of \r\n    divorce in which the husband said to his wife, &lsquo;You are to me as my mother&rsquo;s back&rsquo;; intimacy thus became forbidden, but the woman was not divorced \r\n    completely and was not free to enter into a new marriage - Translator]. Islam gave women their share of inheritance, and stipulated an &lsquo;iddah of \r\n    four months and ten days after the death of her husband, during which she could bathe, change her clothes and see other women and her mahrams. It \r\n    allowed women to buy, sell and own property, and encouraged them to seek knowledge and call people to Allaah. It commanded that women should be \r\n    honoured as wives and as mothers, and made the mother&rsquo;s rights three times greater than those of the father. And there are many other ways in \r\n    which Islam honoured women, which we have no room to discuss in detail here; rather we just wanted to remind you of this.

If he forsakes her, then he is a sinner because there should be no \r\n    harming or reciprocating harm. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The sister says in her question, &ldquo;So he gets the reward of doing charity if he has \r\n    intercourse with her and enjoys intimacy with her, and she will not have any reward, even if she responds unwillingly&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is also not correct. Rather the wife will be rewarded for intercourse in two ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Because she is the twin half of man in rulings and rewards, except those where \r\n    an exception is stated in the texts. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), Never \r\n    will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out \r\n    from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds \r\n    and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allaah, and with Allaah is the best of rewards&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:195]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; It is the cause of the husband being rewarded, and whoever is the cause of \r\n    another person being rewarded will share in the reward without that detracting from his or her reward in the slightest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Abu Dharr that \r\n    some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give \r\n    in charity from their excess wealth.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Has not Allaah given you things with which you can give charity? Every <i>tasbeehah<\/i> (saying &lsquo;<i>Subhaan \r\n    Allaah<\/i> (Glory be to Allaah)&rsquo;) is a charity. Every <i>Takbeerah<\/i> (saying &lsquo;<i>Allaahu akbar<\/i> (Allaah is Most Great)&rsquo;) is a charity. Every\r\n    <i>Tahmeedah<\/i> (saying &lsquo;<i>al-hamdu-Lillaah<\/i> (praise be to Allaah)&rsquo; is a charity. Every <i>Tahleelah<\/i> (saying &lsquo;<i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i> \r\n    (there is no god but Allaah)&rsquo;) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with \r\n    one&rsquo;s wife) is a charity.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Do you not see \r\n    that if he does it in a haraam way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halaal way, he will have a reward for that.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>(Narrated by Muslim, 1006)<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So the wife will be rewarded just as her husband will, just as she is sinning if \r\n    she fulfils her desires in a way that is haraam, just as is the case with the husband.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said: <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;The phrase, &lsquo;Having intercourse is a \r\n    charity&rsquo; &ndash; the word bud&rsquo; (translated here as &lsquo;having intercourse&rsquo;) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself&hellip; <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This indicates that permissible \r\n    actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil \r\n    the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allaah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one&rsquo;s wife chaste, to prevent \r\n    both partners from looking towards or thinking of haraam things, and other good intentions<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The sister says in her question: &ldquo;If he upsets me and humiliates me in front of people, I have \r\n    to make up with him and try to please him, otherwise the angels will curse me&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This also is not correct. The curse applies in the case of a woman who refuses to \r\n    come to her husband&rsquo;s bed with no excuse, when her husband stays angry with her all night &ndash; as explained above &ndash; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But if the husband humiliates her, then he is undoubtedly sinning by doing that, \r\n    and sharee&rsquo;ah allows her to answer him back in a manner that befits his wrongdoing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And indeed whosoever takes revenge after he has suffered wrong, for such there \r\n    is no way (of blame) against them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Shoora 42:41]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>i.e., there is no sin on them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The word <i>man<\/i> (whosoever) here is general in meaning and includes women \r\n    too.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Or if she is patient in bearing harsh words and mistreatment, seeking reward with \r\n    Allaah, she will earn a more complete and better reward.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So what he must do is to make up with her and try to please her, not the other way \r\n    round. If a person does wrong, in order for his repentance to be complete he must try to please the one who has been wronged, with apologies and \r\n    kind words.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Sixthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The sister says: &ldquo;And of course I have no right to differ with his opinion or to argue with \r\n    him, and if I lose my temper I am not forgiven.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is not correct. It is permissible for a women to argue with her husband and \r\n    to have a different opinion, but she does not have the right to refuse to do what he tells her to do &ndash; even if she objects to it &ndash; so long as he \r\n    does not tell her to commit sin, because there is no obedience to anyone if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. This is part of the \r\n    qiwaamah (role of protector and maintainer) that Allaah has given to the husband in return for the obligation to spend on his wife, protect her \r\n    and take care of her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one \r\n    of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:34]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is narrated that the women of the Sahaabah used to argue and debate with them, \r\n    and indeed this is the way in which the Mothers of the Believers [i.e., the Prophet&rsquo;s wives] used to act with our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), as &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab said to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;We Quraysh used \r\n    to control our women, but when we came to the Ansaar we found that they were a people who were controlled by their women. So our women started to \r\n    adopt the ways of the Ansaari women. I got angry with my wife and she argued with me and I did not like her arguing with me. She said, &lsquo;Why do you \r\n    object to me arguing with you? By Allaah, the wives of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) argue with him&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari, 4895; Muslim, 1479.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said &ndash; discussing the lessons to be learned from this hadeeth \r\n    &ndash;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;This indicates that being harsh with women is something blameworthy, because the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) adopted the way of the Ansaar with their women and forsook the way of his people.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 9\/291&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to what the sister mentioned about not being forgiven for any loss of \r\n    temper or irritation on her part, this is not right at all, because there are some kinds of irritation for which a person will not be taken to \r\n    task if he does not speak of them or act upon them, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah will \r\n    forgive my ummah for that which crosses their minds, so long as they do not speak of it or act upon it.&rdquo; And there are some which a person cannot \r\n    help at all, because of intense anger, etc, which is beyond his or her control. At the end of Soorat al-Baqarah is mentioned the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the \r\n    believers (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:286]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>and it is proven in the Sunnah that Allaah has answered this du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and said, &ldquo;I \r\n    will do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Seventhly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The sister says in her question: &ldquo;as you have stated in a fatwa that the reward \r\n    for praying in congregation is only for men and not for women&rdquo;. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This also is not correct. Rather what we said &ndash; based on the ahaadeeth of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) &ndash; is that the twenty-seven-fold reward is for men only, because they are the ones for \r\n    whom prayer in congregation is enjoined, not women. Prayer is congregation is mustahabb for women, but we cannot be certain that women will get \r\n    the twenty-seven-fold reward. It is permissible for women to attend the prayers in the mosque, and it is not permissible for men to forbid them to \r\n    go. If they go and pray with (the men), they will have a share of the reward for praying in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Nevertheless, based on the saheeh ahaadeeth, if a woman prays in her house, she is \r\n    doing that which is better for her than the reward for praying in the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Umar that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not prevent your women from coming to the mosques, although their houses are better for them.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by Abu Dawood, 567; Ahmad, 5445 &ndash; this version narrated by Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeem Abaadi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Their houses are better for them&rdquo; means that their praying in their houses is \r\n    better for them than praying in the mosques, if only they knew that, but they do not know that, so they ask to go out to the mosques and think \r\n    that the reward for going to the mosque is greater. The reason why their praying in their houses is better is because they are safer from fitnah \r\n    (temptation). This ruling is even more necessary because of the tabarruj (wanton display) and adornment that have become prevalent among women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&lsquo;Awn al-Ma&rsquo;bood<\/i>, 2\/193.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Eighthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The sister says in her question: &ldquo;Is this the fate of the Muslim woman if she does well and \r\n    does what is required of her? If she avoids sin, she does not attain any virtue and if she falls short she is one of those who are cursed and \r\n    expelled from the mercy of Allaah, and do I and the accursed Iblees become the same?&rdquo;!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is thinking badly of Allaah, and what you say is not correct at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of \r\n    Islamic monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them \r\n    certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., Paradise in the Hereafter).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nahl 16:97]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), Never \r\n    will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female.

A bad attitude on the \r\n    part of a religious leader puts people off the religion and makes them hate \r\n    it, in addition to the condemnation and special punishment they bring to the \r\n    one who has that attitude.

All of these are ways of calling people to Allaah and \r\n    teaching the people good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Indeed these forums have become a prominent means of \r\n    teaching, guiding, calling people to Islam and enjoining what is good and \r\n    forbidding what is evil, and those who are in charge of them will have a \r\n    great reward, according to their intentions, actions and efforts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, you should seek reward with Allaah for the \r\n    time that you spend in following up on these participants and commenting on \r\n    them and guiding them, but you should be careful not to let that distract \r\n    you from things that are more important and beneficial, such as looking \r\n    after your husband and children, acquiring shar&rsquo;i knowledge, regularly \r\n    reading Qur&rsquo;aan and reciting wird (dhikr), because some people become \r\n    distracted by forums from doing more important things and greater acts of \r\n    worship. Fiqh means understanding priorities and giving precedence to that \r\n    which is more important.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How wonderful it is when a person manages to have a share pf \r\n    every kind of booty, so he has a share of this and of that, and he pays \r\n    attention to that which will benefit him and others, and he strives to \r\n    improve himself in terms of knowledge and action, and he spends some of his \r\n    time to benefit others and call them to Islam and guide them, so he does not \r\n    let one duty distract him from another, or let one good thing keep him from \r\n    doing another. Hence Allaah causes his words to be effective and his advice \r\n    to be beneficial, because he has accompanied his words with actions, and his \r\n    slogan is: <i>&ldquo;I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I \r\n    forbid you. I only desire reform to the best of my power. And my guidance \r\n    cannot come except from Allaah, in Him I trust and unto Him I repent&rdquo; [Hood \r\n    11:88]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Taking care of oneself requires proper understanding and \r\n    wisdom, so a person should take advantage when he had energy and is able to \r\n    focus and make the most of his time. So sometimes he reads Qur&rsquo;aan and does \r\n    a lot of naafil acts of worship, and sometimes he attends circles and \r\n    classes or studies books of knowledge, and sometimes he goes to forums and \r\n    supervises them. The best kind of worship is that which one feels inclined \r\n    towards and feels at ease with it when there is a need for it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote some \r\n    useful words about priorities with regard to acts of worship, and we will \r\n    quote some of it. For example he said: &ldquo;&hellip; The same applies to the person&rsquo;s \r\n    state of mind. When he is in the state of mind that helps him to achieve the \r\n    purpose for which he was created, then that state of mind is much nobler \r\n    than any other. And the same applies to actions. Any action which helps him \r\n    to get closer to the purpose for which he was created is better than any \r\n    other. Hence prayer and jihad are among the best of deeds because they bring \r\n    one closer to that aim, and this is how it should be, because the closer a \r\n    thing is to the goal the better it is than that which is far away from it. \r\n    The action which prepares the heart and mind to know Allaah and His names \r\n    and attributes, and to love Him, fear Him and put one&rsquo;s hopes in Him is \r\n    better than that which is not like that. If a number of deeds have this \r\n    quality in common, then the best of them is that which brings one closest to \r\n    this goal. Hence acts of worship have this goal in common, so they are \r\n    required for the sake of Allaah and sins have in common the fact that they \r\n    block the heart and prevent it from reaching this goal, so they are \r\n    forbidden. The effect of acts of worship and sins depends on their degree. \r\n    This is something to which attention must be paid, which is that a \r\n    particular deed may be better for one person than another. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example, in the case of a rich man who has acquired much \r\n    wealth and is reluctant to spend of it, his giving charity is better for him \r\n    than spending the night in prayer (qiyaam al-layl) and observing naafil \r\n    fasts by day.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of a brave man who can strike fear into the \r\n    enemy&rsquo;s heart with his whip, his spending an hour in the ranks and fighting \r\n    against the enemies of Allaah in jihad is better than Hajj, fasting, giving \r\n    charity or doing naafil acts of worship. In the case of a scholar who knows \r\n    the Sunnah, halal and haraam, and the ways of good and evil, his mixing with \r\n    the people and teaching and advising them about their religion is better \r\n    than his withdrawing and spending his time in prayer, reading Qur&rsquo;aan and \r\n    tasbeeh. End quote from <i>&lsquo;Uddat al-Saabireen<\/i>, p. 93.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship is striving to please the Lord at all \r\n    times by doing whatever is suited to that time and expected for it. The best \r\n    act of worship at times of jihad is jihad, even if that means forsaking \r\n    regular naafil actions such as praying qiyaam at night and fasting by day, \r\n    or even if it means not offering the obligatory prayers in full as one does \r\n    at times of peace and security.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship when a guest comes is fulfilling his \r\n    rights and taking care of him rather that reciting the mustahabb wird. The \r\n    same applies to fulfilling the rights of one&rsquo;s wife and children.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship at the time before dawn is to occupy \r\n    oneself with prayer, Qur&rsquo;aan, du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, dhikr and asking for forgiveness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship when guiding the seeker of knowledge \r\n    and teaching the ignorant is to focus on teaching them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship at the time of the adhaan is to stop \r\n    what one is doing of wird (dhikr) and respond to the muezzin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship at the time of the five daily prayers \r\n    is to strive sincerely to perform the prayers in the best possible manner, \r\n    and to hasten to pray when the time for prayer begins. Going out to the \r\n    mosque even if it is far is better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship at times when someone needs help is \r\n    to use one&rsquo;s position, physical capabilities and wealth to help him and to \r\n    answer his call, and to give that precedence over reciting your wird and \r\n    staying alone.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship at times of reading Qur&rsquo;aan is to \r\n    when one&rsquo;s mind is focused and one is in the right frame of mind to ponder \r\n    its meanings and understand it, until it is as if Allaah is addressing you, \r\n    so you can focus on pondering it and understanding it and resolving to \r\n    implement its commands more than a person would focus if he received a \r\n    letter from the ruler.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship when standing in &lsquo;Arafah is to focus \r\n    on beseeching Allaah, du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and dhikr, and not to fast which would make one \r\n    too weak to focus on that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship during the first ten days of \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah is to do a lot of acts of worship, especially reciting takbeer \r\n    (&ldquo;Allaahu akbar&rdquo;), tahleel (&ldquo;Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah&rdquo;) and tahmeed (&ldquo;al-hamdu \r\n    Lillaah&rdquo;). This is better than jihad for the one for whom jihad is not an \r\n    individual obligation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best act of worship during the last ten days of Ramadaan \r\n    is to spend a lot of time in the mosque, and to be alone and observe \r\n    i&rsquo;tikaaf without mixing with people and being distracted by them. It is even \r\n    better than focusing on teaching them knowledge and Qur&rsquo;aan according to \r\n    many scholars. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are the people whose worship Allaah in every sense of \r\n    the word; other people worship Him in a limited sense (i.e., the people who \r\n    are mostly focused on one type of worship, such as qiyaam al-layl or reading \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan or fasting). When one of them stops doing the kind of worship that \r\n    he is attached to, he feels as if he is falling short and has stopped \r\n    worshipping, so he worships Allaah in just one way. But the one who worships \r\n    in every sense of the word is not more inclined to one type of worship than \r\n    another, rather his aim is to seek the pleasure of Allaah wherever it lies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So his worship is based on that, and he keeps moving through \r\n    different stages of worship, and every time he strives to reach a certain \r\n    status, he keeps himself busy with that, until he sees another level that he \r\n    wants to reach, so he persists in that until the end of the course. So if \r\n    you see the scholars you will him with them, and if you see the worshippers \r\n    you will see him with them, and if you see the mujaahideen you will see him \r\n    with them, and if you see those who remember Allaah you will see him with \r\n    them, and if you see those who give charity and do good you will see him \r\n    with them, and if you see those whose hearts are devoted to Allaah you will \r\n    see him with them. This is the one who worships Allaah in every sense of the \r\n    word, who is not restricted by one type in exclusion to others, and his \r\n    actions are not based on what he is inclined towards and what he finds \r\n    pleasure in, rather he chooses the act of worship that pleases Allaah most, \r\n    even if his joy and ease may be in some other act of worship. This is the \r\n    one who truly fulfils the meaning of <i>Iyyaaka na&rsquo;budu wa iyyaaka nasta&rsquo;een \r\n    (&ldquo;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and \r\n    everything)&rdquo; [al-Faatihah 1:5]<\/i>).

The Muslims \r\n    &ndash; if they achieve this cooperation &ndash; are described as a strong, integrated \r\n    structure, and as a single body. All of that confirms that cooperation and \r\n    mutual support among them is something essential. That includes many aspects \r\n    in the lives of Muslims, which are summed up in the words <i>birr<\/i> \r\n    (righteousness) and <i>taqwa<\/i> (piety) , as Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Help you one another in Al&#8209;Birr and At&#8209;Taqwa (virtue, \r\n    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and \r\n    transgression.

These are two words that sum up all the attributes of \r\n    goodness, such as belief, conduct, rulings and so on.

The verses of the Qur'aan and the ahaadeeth of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) state that Islamic solidarity \r\n    among the Muslims &ndash; individuals, societies, governments and peoples &ndash; is one \r\n    of the most important of ideas, and one of the duties which are essential to \r\n    the welfare of society and the well being of their religious affairs and the \r\n    soundness of their interactions and to united them against their common foe. \r\n    There are many verses and ahaadeeth which speak of this, if not in these \r\n    exact words then in similar meanings. Islamic solidarity means helping one \r\n    another, standing shoulder to shoulder, supporting and advising one another \r\n    and other such phrases. That includes enjoining what is good and forbidding \r\n    what is evil, calling others to Allaah, and guiding people to that which \r\n    will lead to their happiness and salvation, in this world and the Hereafter. \r\n    That also includes teaching the ignorant, helping the destitute, supporting \r\n    the one who is wronged, stopping the wrongdoer from wronging others, \r\n    establishing the law of Allaah, maintaining security, stopping miscreants \r\n    and mischief-makers, protecting roads, providing means of transportation by \r\n    land, sea and air, and providing means of communication both land-based and \r\n    wireless, so that their common worldly and religious interests may be \r\n    achieved, and so as to facilitate cooperation between Muslims in everything \r\n    that may protect the truth, establish justice and spread peace and security \r\n    in all regions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Mutual support also \r\n    includes reconciling between Muslims, resolving armed conflicts between them \r\n    and fighting the offending party until it complies with the command of \r\n    Allaah, in accordance with the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So fear Allaah and \r\n    adjust all matters of difference among you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Anfaal 8:1]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And if two parties (or \r\n    groups) among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them \r\n    both.

As for groups which call \r\n    people to Islam, but they have some things that go against sharee&rsquo;ah, the \r\n    Muslim may cooperate with them in matters that are in accordance with \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars of the \r\n    Standing Committee said:&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Each of these groups have \r\n    things that are wrong and things that are right.

There is no reason why there \r\n    should not be such groups if they call people to the Book of Allaah and the \r\n    Sunnah of His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Baaz<\/i> (5\/272).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if there is no \r\n    organized effort at all, or there is no effort in which the good outweighs \r\n    the bad, and a person cannot cooperate with any organization, that does not \r\n    mean that a person cannot cooperate with others around him, of his own \r\n    choosing, to advise one another and remind one another to seek beneficial \r\n    knowledge and do righteous deeds, and spread good among the Muslims.

They try to present it as an odd call with weird ideas, which is extreme \r\n    in following the ideas of its imam and goes against the way of ahl al-sunnah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-jamaa&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (2\/255):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Wahhaabism is a name given by the opponents of Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) to his call to \r\n    cleanse Tawheed of all elements of shirk and to abolish all ways except the \r\n    way of Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him). What they intend thereby is to put people off his call and block them \r\n    from what he promoted. But it was not harmed by that, rather it caused it to \r\n    spread even further and caused more people to come to it whom Allaah guided \r\n    to look into what the da&rsquo;wah was all about and what evidence it had from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.

So it should rightly be called the Salafi \r\n    da&rsquo;wah, because the one who founded it did not introduce any innovation in \r\n    that which was named after him, as the promoters of misguided sects such as \r\n    the Ismailis and Qarmatiyyah introduced innovations. If those misguided \r\n    sects had called themselves salafis, the people and the historical record \r\n    would have rejected this name, because they are outside the path of the \r\n    salaf and were introduced by their founders.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct name, both in wording and meaning, for the call \r\n    of Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab is the Muhammadan da&rsquo;wah or the \r\n    Salafi da&rsquo;wah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But because this name annoys the enemies, they used an \r\n    incorrect name.

Indeed, they gave this name to everyone who follows the \r\n    way of the salaf, even in India, Egypt, Africa and elsewhere. By giving it \r\n    this label, its opponents wanted to isolate the da&rsquo;wah from the right path. \r\n    So they excluded it from the four madhhabs and counted it as a fifth \r\n    madhhab, &ldquo;out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth has become \r\n    manifest unto them&rdquo; (al-Baqarah 2:109).

In fact his study of \r\n    the views of these two imams led him to the conclusion that Islam, in the \r\n    form that was prevalent during his time, especially among the Turks, was \r\n    mixed with a great deal of incorrect ideas that had nothing to so with the \r\n    sound Islamic teachings. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ahmad Ameen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; In his da&rsquo;wah and teachings, he followed the example of a \r\n    great scholar and teacher who had appeared in the seventh century AH at the \r\n    time of the Sultan al-Naasir, namely Ibn Taymiyah, who believed in ijtihaad \r\n    and was a free thinker within the limits set by the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. It \r\n    seems that Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab knew of Ibn Taymiyah, who was his \r\n    imam and leader, and his example, the one who inspired him with regard to \r\n    ijtihaad and calling for reform. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>Athar Da&rsquo;wat Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah \r\n    fi&rsquo;l-Harakaat al-Islamiyyah al-Mu&rsquo;aasirah<\/i> (1\/136-138) by Salaah al-Deen \r\n    Maqbool.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But despite this strong link between the two imams, Imam \r\n    Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab was a follower of evidence and was not a blind \r\n    follower of personalities. He understood that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah \r\n    was one of the great imams of Islam, but that all humans are prone to error. \r\n    He understood that Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was not an \r\n    innovator who introduced a new message that was alien to Islam, rather he \r\n    was following the way of the righteous salaf and following should be based \r\n    on evidence and consensus among the imams. But no imam should be followed \r\n    blindly no matter how great his level of knowledge, rather anyone&rsquo;s opinion \r\n    may be accepted or rejected except the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Bayaan bi&rsquo;l-Daleel<\/i> (150), refuting the claim that Shaykh Muhammad ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab was nothing but a carbon-copy of Ibn Taymiyah:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what he said about the academic level of Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab: He did not study anything but the writing of \r\n    Ibn Taymiyah! It is as if he had not read the biography of the Shaykh and \r\n    did not know anything about his level of knowledge, or he did know it but he \r\n    concealed it in order to demean him and to deceive those who knew nothing \r\n    about the Shaykh. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But this does not conceal the truth. Writers have written \r\n    many books about the Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) that have been \r\n    published throughout the world and which are known to the elite and common \r\n    folk alike. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) studied fiqh, hadeeth and \r\n    usool in depth, including the books of &lsquo;aqeedah that were compiled and \r\n    written by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim. He \r\n    graduated at the hands of great scholars and imams in various fields in \r\n    Najd, the Hijaaz, al-Ihsa&rsquo; and Basrah. He was granted ijaazahs to narrate \r\n    from them and convey their knowledge.&nbsp; He studied, issued fatwas and wrote \r\n    books about fiqh, hadeeth and &lsquo;aqeedah until he earned the admiration of \r\n    those who gathered around him or listened to his lessons and debates, or who \r\n    read any of his writings. His writings point to the vastness of his \r\n    knowledge of Islamic sciences and the depth of his understanding. What he \r\n    spoke of in those writings was not limited only to the books of Ibn Taymiyah \r\n    &ndash; as those who are ignorant or who pretend to be ignorant think &ndash; rather he \r\n    also quoted the views of prominent imams on fiqh, tafseer and hadeeth, which \r\n    is indicative of the depth of his knowledge and understanding, and his keen \r\n    insight. His books that have been printed and are in circulation bear \r\n    witness to that, praise be to Allaah. He did not quote only the words of \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and ignore the opinions of others, unless he \r\n    believed Ibn Taymiyah&rsquo;s view to be stronger on the basis of evidence. In \r\n    fact, he disagreed with Ibn Taymiyah on some matters of fiqh.

The purpose of it is to rebuke and discipline the one who is being \r\n    shunned, and to put others off from being like him. If that is likely to \r\n    serve an interest, so that shunning him will weaken and reduce the evil, \r\n    then it is prescribed, But if neither the one who is being shunned nor \r\n    anyone else will be deterred by that, rather it will make things worse, and \r\n    the one who wants to shun him is weak, so that it will do more harm than \r\n    good, then it is not prescribed to shun, rather softening people&rsquo;s hearts \r\n    may be more beneficial in some cases than shunning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And shunning is more \r\n    beneficial in some cases then softening hearts.

Should we shun them as prescribed in Islam or what?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: undoubtedly \r\n    neglecting prayer is a cause of doom, because if prayer is done properly all \r\n    one&rsquo;s deeds will be in order, but if it is not in order, all of one&rsquo;s deeds \r\n    will be spoiled. It is like the heart of one's deeds. Hence when the \r\n    Reckoning comes on the Day of Resurrection, the first thing that will be \r\n    examined will be one's prayer. If a person neglected it then he is more \r\n    likely to have neglected other duties, but if he prayed regularly then the \r\n    rest of his deeds will be examined. And prayer is the pillar (or foundation) \r\n    of faith; if it falls, the entire structure will collapse.

If they pay heed, \r\n    this is what we want. If they do not pay heed, then we should look at the \r\n    matter further. Will shunning them and keeping away from them serve any \r\n    interest such as making them feel ashamed so that they will repent, or will \r\n    it only make matters worse and put them off more? If it is the latter, then \r\n    we should not forsake them. If it is the former, then we should shun them, \r\n    i.e., if our shunning them will make them feel ashamed and mend their ways, \r\n    then we should shun them until they mend their ways. But if shunning will \r\n    not achieve anything, rather it will only make matters worse, then we should \r\n    not shun them, because shunning is a medicine, and when is medicine used? It \r\n    is used when needed and when it is thought it will be of benefit. If it is \r\n    thought that the medicine will not be of benefit, then it should not be \r\n    used.

The lengthy hadeeth about their story is narrated in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> \r\n    from Ka&rsquo;b ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him), who was one of the \r\n    three.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    discussing the lessons learned from this hadeeth:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (One of the lessons we learn) is not saying salaams to one \r\n    who commits sin, and that it is permissible to shun him for more than three \r\n    days. The prohibition on shunning someone for more than three days is to be \r\n    understood as referring to situations where the reason for shunning is not \r\n    something prescribed in Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Another lesson we learn) is that the obligation to return \r\n    salaams is waived in the case of one who is greeted by the person who is \r\n    being shunned, because if it were obligatory, Ka&rsquo;b would not have wondered \r\n    whether he (the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) \r\n    moved his lips in returning the greeting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> (8\/124).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is clear to us from the context of the hadeeth &ndash; which we \r\n    will not quote here due to its length &ndash; that one of the rulings on the kind \r\n    of shunning that is prescribed in Islam is that is it permissible not to \r\n    give or return salaams to the one who is sinning &ndash; and even more so in the \r\n    case of one who is introducing innovation &ndash; and that there is no time limit \r\n    on shunning him, rather that may last until he repents or until the one who \r\n    is shunning him thinks that the purpose has been served &ndash; as we shall see \r\n    below. Hence you can see that there is nothing Islamically wrong with your \r\n    not shaking hands with that sinner and not greeting him. To make the matter \r\n    more certain:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person is known to openly fail to do obligatory duties \r\n    or to do haraam things, then he deserves to be shunned and should not be \r\n    greeted with salaams, as a rebuke to him, until he repents.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (23\/252).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it is essential to note that shunning of sinners and \r\n    innovators has only been prescribed for important reasons, such as shunning \r\n    him in order to discipline him so that he will give up his sin and \r\n    innovation, and to warn others against falling into sin and innovation. If \r\n    shunning has no effect on the sinner or only makes him more stubborn, then \r\n    there is no point in shunning him, because of the bad consequences to which \r\n    that may lead for the one who is shunned, or because it will not serve the \r\n    purpose for which shunning was prescribed. In that case softening the heart \r\n    of the sinner will be more effective than shunning him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shunning varies according to how strong or weak, and how few \r\n    or how numerous the people who are doing the shunning are. The purpose is to \r\n    rebuke and discipline the person being shunned and to deter the masses from \r\n    doing likewise.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the purpose is more likely be to achieved by shunning, and \r\n    it will weaken and reduce the evil, then it is prescribed, but if the person \r\n    being shunned and others will not be deterred by that, rather the evil will \r\n    increase, and the person doing the shunning is weak and the bad consequences \r\n    will outweigh the good, then shunning is not prescribed, rather softening \r\n    the hearts of some people is more effective than shunning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But in some cases shunning is more effective than softening \r\n    the hearts. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) sought to soften the hearts of some people and shunned others, and the \r\n    three who stayed behind (from Tabook) were better than most of those whose \r\n    hearts were to be softened, because they were leaders who held positions of \r\n    influence among their tribes. So the interests of Islam dictated that the \r\n    hearts of the leaders be softened, whereas the three who were shunned were \r\n    believers and there were many other believers besides them. So shunning them \r\n    was supporting Islam and was a means of purifying them of their sins. \r\n    Similarly what is prescribed with regard to the enemy is to fight them \r\n    sometimes, and to seek truces with them sometimes, and to take the jizyah \r\n    sometimes, according to circumstances and what is in the ummah&rsquo;s best \r\n    interests. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (28\/206).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the guideline on shunning a sinner who does not \r\n    commit sin openly in front of people, if there is an interest to be served \r\n    by shunning him?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The guideline is that if shunning a sinner will serve a \r\n    purpose such as deterring him from his sin, then he should be shunned. But \r\n    if it will serve no purpose, then shunning him is haraam, because the sinner \r\n    is still a Muslim, no matter what major sin he may commit, except kufr if \r\n    that is the case. This is well known. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;It is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his \r\n    fellow-Muslim for more than three (days), each of them turning away if they \r\n    meet. The better of them is the one who greets the other first.&rdquo; So you \r\n    should not shun him. And there are some sinners who, if they are shunned, \r\n    will increase in sin and hate you as well, and will not accept any advice \r\n    from you. But if shunning him will be of benefit, such as if he is one of \r\n    your children or brothers, and he respects you, and shunning him will serve \r\n    as a rebuke, then in the case you may shun him so that he will be rebuked. \r\n    Then if you shun him but that does not work as a rebuke, then you should \r\n    resume contact with him and greet him with salaam, and do not forget to \r\n    advise him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Liqaa&rsquo;aat al-Baab il-Maftoohah<\/i> \r\n    (231\/question no. 9).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you think that not greeting him with salaam will have an \r\n    effect on him and will work as a rebuke for his sins, then carry on shunning \r\n    him and stop greeting him with salaam or responding if he greets you. But if \r\n    you think that this is of no benefit, then remember that seeking to soften \r\n    his heart with gifts, smiling at him and speaking kindly to him may be more \r\n    effective than shunning him, so do that. If he refuses that from you, and \r\n    does not respond to you, then there is no sin on you and you are not to \r\n    blame for that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Musnad al-Imam Ahmad<\/i> (15823) it is narrated that \r\n    Hishaam ibn &lsquo;Aamir said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: &ldquo;It is not permissible for a Muslim to \r\n    shun a Muslim for more than three days. If they forsake one another for more \r\n    than three days then they are deviating from the truth so long as they are \r\n    forsaking one another. If one of them attempts reconciliation first, that \r\n    will be an expiation for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he greets him with salaam and he does not \r\n    respond or return his salaam, then the angels will respond to him and the \r\n    shaytaan will respond to the other one, and if they die whilst forsaking one \r\n    another they will never meet in Paradise!&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>al-Saheehah<\/i>, 1246.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to decree reward for us and you, and to guide \r\n    us and you to what which He loves and which pleases Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9707","question_id":"9707","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    This principle which some people speak of, that &ldquo;there is no \r\n    denunciation with regard to matters concerning which the scholars differed,&rdquo; \r\n    is not correct, and the correct view is that &ldquo;there is no denunciation with \r\n    regard to matters that are subject to ijtihaad.&rdquo; To explain that, we have to \r\n    know that the matters concerning which the scholars differed are of two \r\n    types. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; There are issues for which the ruling has been clearly \r\n    stated in the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan or the saheeh Sunnah with no opposing text, or it \r\n    is narrated that there was scholarly consensus, although some later scholars \r\n    held odd views and went against that consensus, or the ruling was derived by \r\n    means of clear and unambiguous analogy.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab said: &hellip; If the one \r\n    whosaid this was referring to issues of dispute, this is invalid and goes \r\n    against the consensus of the ummah. The Sahaabah and those who came after \r\n    them continued to denounce those who held views (contrary to the evidence) \r\n    and made mistakes, no matter who they were, even if they were the most \r\n    knowledgeable and pious of the people. Allaah sent Muhammad with guidance \r\n    and true religion, and He commanded us to follow him and to forsake that \r\n    which goes against that. Part of following him means that if a scholar goes \r\n    against that by mistake, his error must be pointed out and he must be \r\n    denounced. If what it meant by matters of ijtihaad is matters concerning \r\n    which the scholars differed and for which the correct view is not clear, \r\n    then this is a valid point, and it is not permissible for anyone to denounce \r\n    something that differs from his madhhab or the people&rsquo;s customs. As it is \r\n    not permissible for anyone to enjoin anything without knowledge, by the same \r\n    token it is not permissible for anyone to denounce anything without \r\n    knowledge. All of this is included in the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, \r\n    or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge&rdquo; [al-Isra&rsquo; \r\n    17:36]<\/i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; End quote from <i>al-Durar al-Saniyyah<\/i> (4\/8).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; al-Shawkaani said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view &ndash; that there is no denunciation with regard to \r\n    matters concerning which the scholars differed &ndash; has become the greatest \r\n    means of preventing the enjoining of what is good and the forbidding of what \r\n    is evil, which are of a high status as you know.&nbsp; It been enjoined and made \r\n    obligatory upon this ummah by Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to enjoin that which is good according to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah and forbid that which is evil according to sharee&rsquo;ah, and the \r\n    measure of that is the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. Every Muslim should enjoin that \r\n    which he finds is regarded as good in both or either of them, and he should \r\n    forbid that which he finds is regarded as evil in both or either of them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If any scholar says something that differs from that, then \r\n    his words are to be rejected and he is to be denounced, as is the one who \r\n    follows his view.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This noble sharee&rsquo;ah, in which we are commanded to enjoin \r\n    that which it describes as good and denounce that which it describes as \r\n    evil, is that which is found in the Qur'aan and Sunnah.

(The first category is) matters of ijtihaad in which differences \r\n    of opinion are valid, in the sense that is a good reason for these \r\n    differences of opinion. In this case the mujtahid is not to be denounced, \r\n    and the ordinary Muslims are obliged to follow what the scholars of their \r\n    country say, so that the masses will not be left in confusion, because if we \r\n    were to say to the ordinary Muslim: Follow whichever opinion you like, then \r\n    the community would be disunited. Hence our Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sa&rsquo;di \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The common folk should follow the \r\n    madhhab of their scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second category is matters concerning which differences \r\n    of opinion are not valid and there is no room for ijtihaad.

Some of them have to do with beliefs, some have to do \r\n    with minor practical issues of sharee&rsquo;ah; some put a person beyond the pale \r\n    of Islam whereas others do not. In some cases the daa&rsquo;iyah may think that \r\n    something is an innovation when it is not, or there may be a scholarly \r\n    opinion which is less correct than the opinion with which he is familiar, or \r\n    there may be another opinion on the matter of which he is not aware. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Usually questions are asked about an imam who is doing \r\n    innovated actions and the ruling thereon, and the answers are well known.&nbsp; \r\n    If his bid&rsquo;ah is one that constitutes kufr, then it is not permissible to \r\n    pray behind him; if it does not constitute kufr, then it is valid to pray \r\n    behind him, but it is better to pray behind an imam who is of Ahl al-Sunnah. \r\n    Concerning such cases al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;Pray, and he is accountable for his bid&rsquo;ah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the question is about a bid&rsquo;ah which the members of \r\n    the congregation are doing and the question is coming from the imam, there \r\n    is something a little odd about that. The job of the imam is not only to \r\n    lead the people in prayer, rather he also calls them, teaches them and \r\n    advises them. Any imam who leads the people in prayer will usually have \r\n    behind him people who shave their beards, deal in riba, disobey their \r\n    parents, backbite and spread gossip, and so on&hellip; they are the target audience \r\n    of the imam&rsquo;s da&rsquo;wah in the mosque. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Calling people to Allaah and teaching them is the mission of \r\n    the Prophets; they are also obligatory upon everyone to whom Allaah gives \r\n    knowledge, even if it is only a little.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This was the way of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him); if he saw a mistake he would correct it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example, when he saw a person praying badly and not \r\n    bowing or prostrating correctly, he taught him how to pray. Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When Mu&rsquo;aawiyah ibn Hakam spoke during the prayer, the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught him that no \r\n    speech of man was appropriate during the prayer.

He can do that by making the most of the best \r\n    opportunity to advise them and guide them, in numerous ways, such as the \r\n    following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Reciting specific verses of Qur'aan, then explaining their \r\n    meanings after the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Inviting some daa&rsquo;iyahs and seekers of knowledge to give \r\n    lectures or lessons on the Sunnah and following it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Distributing leaflets and pamphlets.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Setting up an audio library and encouraging people to borrow \r\n    from it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In all cases, the imam should be knowledgeable, gentle and \r\n    wise, and above all he should be sincere in his love for people, so that he \r\n    may be granted divine help and success.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the people to whom the call (da&rsquo;wah) is addressed are \r\n    influenced by a particular culture or society, what is the best way to call \r\n    them?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who is calling them to Allaah should explain to them \r\n    the mistakes and bid&rsquo;ahs etc that are present in the ways that they are \r\n    following and the cultures to which they belong, and the environments in \r\n    which they live. He should explain to them the things that are contrary to \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah in their societies in which they live, and call them to examine \r\n    everything about which they are confused against the most just standard, \r\n    which is the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whatever is in accordance with one or both \r\n    of them may be regarded as legitimate according to sharee&rsquo;ah, and whatever \r\n    goes against them should be rejected, no matter who advocates it.

Depriving the \r\n    people of access to their call, when there is no effective alternative, is a \r\n    method that is not approved of in Islam, for one of the basic principles of \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah is to reduce evils and promote good among the people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The good that is achieved by \r\n    these daa&rsquo;iyahs, such as guiding the youth, encouraging girls to observe \r\n    hijab and encouraging people to pray regularly are important matters that \r\n    are among the greatest aims of sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The shortcomings that you \r\n    mention, meaning that some daa&rsquo;iyahs fall short in some aspects, should not \r\n    be allowed to overshadow the benefits mentioned, especially since they have \r\n    to do with minor issues and are limited to the individual, whereas the \r\n    benefits are great and reach many people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence there is no reason why \r\n    you should not sell tapes by these daa&rsquo;iyahs, so long as they are following \r\n    the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah. If any of them make a mistake with \r\n    regard to some matter, the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah is to advise \r\n    them by getting in touch with them or writing to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whoever thinks about the \r\n    daa&rsquo;iyahs who deliver khutbahs and lectures or broadcast on TV and radio \r\n    etc, will notice that they are of different types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of them are following \r\n    the path of the salaf in their methodology, moderation and action.&nbsp; We \r\n    should listen to these daa&rsquo;iyahs and encourage people to listen to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of them are correct in \r\n    most of what they say, but they fall somewhat short in the field of action. \r\n    They should be listened to, because their shortcomings are usually limited \r\n    only to themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of them mix right and \r\n    wrong but in general they follow the Sunnah and do not adopt any ideas of \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) and do not promote it, so we should not put people off \r\n    from listening to them altogether, rather we should correct their mistakes \r\n    and speak about their errors in a just and fair manner, whilst also praising \r\n    their good points.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of them are people of \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah and shirk, which they spread and promote. We should not listen to \r\n    them and we should warn others against them, and not praise their good \r\n    points, because that means we are praising them when they have committed \r\n    major sins which cancel out any good deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The above has to do with the \r\n    daa&rsquo;iyahs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>On the other hand, there are \r\n    people who speak of the daa&rsquo;iyahs in a just manner, and others who speak of \r\n    them in an unfair manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Among the latter there are \r\n    some who are unjust and unfair; they accuse some daa&rsquo;iyahs of bid&rsquo;ah when in \r\n    fact they do not follow bid&rsquo;ah, and warn others against them, when it is \r\n    more appropriate to warn people against these unfair critics, because they \r\n    are unfair and wrongdoers. No attention should be paid to their warnings \r\n    because of their unfairness and wrongdoing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence we must know how to \r\n    distinguish between sin, bid&rsquo;ah, error and mistakes with regard to the basic \r\n    tenets of &lsquo;aqeedah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We will give some examples:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If there is a daa&rsquo;iyah who \r\n    calls people to the path of the salaf, but he is extreme and harsh, then he \r\n    should be praised for his methodology but he should be given advice with \r\n    regard to his harshness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If there is a preacher who \r\n    quotes da&rsquo;eef and munkar (weak and unsound) ahaadeeth, but there is also a \r\n    lot of truth in what he says, then he should be praised for his preaching, \r\n    but he should be told of the error of his quoting weak and fabricated \r\n    ahaadeeth and taking them as evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If there is someone who \r\n    reminds the people and teaches them about proper morals, etiquette and \r\n    virtues, but he shaves his beard, for example, or sits in mixed gatherings, \r\n    then he should be praised for his good qualities but should be told of the \r\n    rulings regarding the matters where he goes against the Sunnah. If he calls \r\n    for abandoning some of the obligatory or mustahabb Sunnahs, then that view \r\n    should also be refuted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If there is someone who \r\n    teaches the people bid&rsquo;ah (innovations) and encourages them to associate \r\n    others with Allaah, such as seeking the help of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), dead &ldquo;saints&rdquo; (awliya&rsquo;) or occupants of \r\n    graves, or encourages them to pray to them and ask of them, then we should \r\n    warn others against him and explain the falseness of his belief and shirk. \r\n    We should tell the people not to listen to anything that he says because it \r\n    involves dangerous and harmful ideas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If there is someone who \r\n    mixes truth and falsehood, Sunnah and bid&rsquo;ah, we should not encourage the \r\n    people to listen to him; rather we should point out the error of his ways. \r\n    When he starts to propagate his wrong ideas, then the should be advised and \r\n    requested to retract these ideas publicly.

With regard to your saying why should I \r\n    set myself straight, Allaah has stated the reason why He created death and \r\n    life in this world.

Everyone who obeys Allaah and avoids disobeying \r\n    Him is following light from Allaah and is pious. Everyone who disobeys \r\n    Allaah is falling short in piety to the extent of his disobedience or sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this is what piety means, then it cannot be attained \r\n    simply by calling oneself a Salafi or anything else, or joining any of the \r\n    groups. Rather the more one attains of the causes of piety &ndash; such as \r\n    learning about Allaah and His laws and acting upon them &ndash; the greater share \r\n    one will have of piety and the higher his status will be in Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because of that, we have to differentiate between the Salafi \r\n    manhaj (way or methodology) which is protected from error as it is based on \r\n    the sources of sharee&rsquo;ah, namely the Qur&rsquo;aan, Sunnah and scholarly \r\n    consensus, and the individuals who claim to belong to this path. These \r\n    individuals are not free of error with regard to their knowledge or actions, \r\n    whether that error is a sin or even a bid&rsquo;ah (innovation). Rather the person \r\n    who does it is to blame for it; it is not permissible to blame the manhaj \r\n    for this mistake. That leads to vilification of the Salafi manhaj on the \r\n    grounds that So and so (a Salafi) made a mistake and did such and such.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There follow some examples which will explain that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam is undoubtedly the religion of Allaah, and He will not \r\n    accept any other.

With regard to what you have asked about, the issue of \r\n    women who are new in Islam speaking to men, the texts of Islam have set out \r\n    basic guidelines governing the relationship between men and women in a \r\n    manner that achieves the aims of sharee&rsquo;ah whilst also protecting Muslim men \r\n    and women from the things that lead to fitnah. Wise people &ndash; even the \r\n    kuffaar themselves &ndash; have attested to the effect that these general \r\n    guidelines have had in reforming society; this is also to be seen from the \r\n    history of Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam describes the basis of the relationship between the \r\n    sexes in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. One of the most important texts is the \r\n    verse (interpretation of the meaning): &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. \r\n    If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in \r\n    whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should \r\n    be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Ahzaab 33:32]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is not allowed here \r\n    is being soft in speech. So the woman should speak in an honourable manner. \r\n    What this means, as the mufassireen have said, is that a woman should not \r\n    make her speech soft when she speaks to men. Although this verse is \r\n    addressed to the wives of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him), the reason, which is to prevent evil and immoral men from \r\n    entertaining indecent notions concerning the chaste Muslim women, is a \r\n    reason that is general in meaning, so all the believing women are included \r\n    here. Al-Jassaas said concerning this verse: It indicates that this is a \r\n    ruling which applies to all women: they are forbidden to speak softly to men \r\n    in a manner that might make them entertain indecent notions concerning them.\r\n    <i>Ahkaam al-Qur&rsquo;aan<\/i>, 5\/229.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam has sent out general guidelines in the light of which \r\n    the details of specific issues may be worked out. We do not need to quote \r\n    the evidence in detail for each matter. The general principle set out in \r\n    this verse may cover many of the specific issues, including the situation \r\n    under discussion here. In the answers to questions no. 1497, 1121, and 6543 \r\n    you will find a detailed description of the guidelines concerning \r\n    conversations between men and women; there is no need to repeat them here.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle with regard to teaching the rulings of \r\n    Islam is that the man should be the teacher, because Allaah has given him \r\n    leadership [?] to act as imam and to issue fatwas and pass judgements, etc. \r\n    Hence there is nothing wrong with women asking men about the rulings of \r\n    Islam, as the women used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about religious matters, especially if the \r\n    woman who is asking is new in Islam and needs to learn rulings that will \r\n    make sure her &lsquo;aqeedah (belief) is correct and will increase her conviction \r\n    and belief in this religion. When a man teaches a woman, that must be done \r\n    in accordance with the Islamic guidelines referred to.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted by our brothers who are conveying the \r\n    message of Islam to that country &ndash; especially the young men among them &ndash; \r\n    that the one who knows himself to be weak and fears that he may fall into \r\n    the traps of the Shaytaan, namely becoming attracted to the women and being \r\n    distracted from da&rsquo;wah, should avoid being in direct contact with women when \r\n    making da&rsquo;wah, so long as there are others who are more able to do this \r\n    task. If there is a need to speak to them, then he should do as little as \r\n    possible. As for one who thinks that he can be steadfast and is sure of \r\n    himself, the basic principle is that it is permissible for him to speak to \r\n    women, but that is subject to conditions, as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Avoiding talking a great deal \r\n    about matters other than the topic under discussion, or other than calling \r\n    people to Islam.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Not joking or making the voice \r\n    soft, etc.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Not asking about personal \r\n    matters which have nothing to do with the topic, such as asking the woman&rsquo;s \r\n    age etc.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If some female daa&rsquo;iyahs or \r\n    women who are already Muslim can answer the questions, or if they can be \r\n    answered through other media such as audiotapes or computer programs, that \r\n    is better. It is also better if a number of trustworthy people can take on \r\n    the task of teaching this new Muslim lady as this will make it less likely \r\n    that a relationship or attachment will develop and she will become more \r\n    attached to the religion than to the particular person who guided her to the \r\n    religion.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Stopping talking to her \r\n    immediately if there are any stirrings of attachment or desire in the heart; \r\n    remembering that Allaah is always watching, because this is a hidden matter \r\n    which is known to no one except the daa&rsquo;iyah himself.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the new Muslim sister, he should explain to \r\n    her the general evidence that sets out the guidelines for this relationship \r\n    and the great wisdom behind it. The daa&rsquo;iyah should be keen to guide her to \r\n    focus her attachment on Allaah because that will be more effective in making \r\n    her steadfast and keeping her away from forming an attachment to the men who \r\n    have called her to Islam. If she does anything that is forbidden in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah in this regard, such as making her voice soft and so on, he should \r\n    speak kindly to her so that Islam will become firmly rooted in her heart and \r\n    she will develop a love for Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to help us to convey the light and message of Islam and to follow His laws and the Sunnah of our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in all our affairs.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9715","question_id":"9715","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no doubt concerning the universal truth that you \r\n    have mentioned.

What is the evidence for that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Before we embark on this discussion, we must \r\n    note an important point, which is that we will come across an old dispute about radio and TV, and we will not pay any attention to the view that \r\n    rejects them and considers them to be unacceptable and idle entertainment, or objects to the use of images in TV.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I say we will ignore that and accept the view \r\n    of those who say that they are ordinary means that it is possible to use them in a beneficial way without doing something haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The ruling on participating in Arabic \r\n    satellite channels etc:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It seems that there can be only two views on \r\n    this issue:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; That it is not permissible to participate \r\n    in them<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; That it is permissible to participate in \r\n    them&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Some scholars do not discuss the matter in \r\n    such a straightforward manner; rather they think that it is subject to further discussion, which we will highlight below.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I will try to discuss the various opinions \r\n    and examine their evidence and analyze it as much as I can:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>1 &ndash; The view that we should not \r\n    participate:<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The most prominent evidence for that is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That it is a means that is based on something false and that it is not primarily aimed at spreading \r\n    virtue and proclaiming the word of Allaah, rather it was established for an unworthy purpose, and no matter how much people&rsquo;s aims may vary, they \r\n    are almost all engaging in one thing which is unacceptable and idle entertainment.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Almost all these channels agree that women \r\n    with their charms, beauty and speech are the most important means of attracting viewers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Music and singing &ndash; whether eastern or \r\n    western &ndash; is the other means of attracting viewers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That is in addition from the obscene content, \r\n    whether it is a debate, songs or even the news.

Al-Nasaa&rsquo;i narrated with a jayyid isnaad that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being \r\n    served.&rdquo; See <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 9\/250.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>These texts are applicable to these satellite \r\n    channels etc, which poke fun at the word of truth and those who call others to the truth, as they may devote a few minutes to the truth amidst \r\n    hours of falsehood.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And leave alone those who take their \r\n    religion as play and amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:70]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; When people of virtue to get involved \r\n    with them, they give them some measure of legitimacy, which is exploited by the owners and financers of these channels, and by those who listen to \r\n    them and watch them, thus causing confusion for the simple-minded.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><u>2 &ndash; The view that it is permissible to \r\n    participate<\/u>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Those who say that it is permissible to \r\n    participate quote some evidence:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>They say that we must differentiate between things which are haraam in and of themselves, such as \r\n    wine, music, speaking falsehood and the things that lead to that, because not everything that may lead to haraam is necessarily haraam itself.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Quraafi said in al-Furooq (no. 58): Note: \r\n    the means that leads to something haraam may not be haraam itself, if it serves a certain purpose, such as giving money to a man who will consume \r\n    it unlawfully so that he will not commit adultery with a woman if that cannot be warded off in any other way. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said in <i>I&rsquo;laam \r\n    al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een<\/i> (2\/137): What is forbidden in order to block the means that lead to evil may be permitted if it serves a greater purpose, such \r\n    as allowing a man to look at a woman when proposing marriage to her, when bearing witness and for the purpose of medical examination or \r\n    treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Media and means of communication come under \r\n    this heading. Indeed they are permissible in and of themselves, based on the fact that if the believers owned them and used them to spread the \r\n    truth, there would be no doubt as to whether they are permissible. They would be like platforms and clubs that are used as a means for discussion \r\n    and conveying the message.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The fact that they are used as a means of \r\n    spreading doubts and provoking desires should not prevent righteous people from playing a role in them and urging the owners so that they can \r\n    spread the truth, or some of it, as much as they can.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Imagine a cultural club or meeting place that \r\n    many people go to, which opens its doors to all comers, and most of those who come are followers of falsehood. Is it not essential that people of \r\n    virtue and daa&rsquo;iyahs should also participate in that case?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Indeed, and it seems that there is no great \r\n    difference between these media and these clubs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Perhaps what lends weight to this analogy is \r\n    the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to attend the gatherings and marketplaces of the people of \r\n    Jaahiliyyah for the purpose of da&rsquo;wah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Jaabir ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah SAW stayed in Makkah for ten years, following the people in their camps in &lsquo;Ukaaz \r\n    and Mijannah, and during the Hajj seasons in Mina, saying, &ldquo;Who will support me in conveying the message of my Lord, and Paradise will be his?&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad<\/i>, 3\/322.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Rabee&rsquo;ah al-Deeli said: \r\n    I saw the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during the Jaahiliyyah in the market of Dhu&rsquo;l-Majaaz, saying, &ldquo;O people, say <i>\r\n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i> and you will prosper!&rdquo; Its isnaad is hasan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is well known that &lsquo;Ukaaz, Mijannah and \r\n    Dhu&rsquo;l-Majaaz were marketplaces during the Jaahiliyyah where the Arabs used to gather and recite poetry and boast to one another, and they would \r\n    even complete or dispute one another.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    It is well known from the biography of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he used to mix with the \r\n    mushrikeen and Jews and Christians for the purpose of calling them to Allaah (da&rsquo;wah). Some mushrikeen or Jews would sit with him and debate with \r\n    him, and he would recite Qur&rsquo;aan to them.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The evidence for that is mutawaatir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For example, Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) narrated that he rode behind the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a donkey to visit Sa&rsquo;d ibn &lsquo;Ubaadah \r\n    who was sick. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by a gathering where &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ubayy ibn Salool was \r\n    present, and in the gathering there was a mixture of Muslims, mushrikeen and Jews. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    greeted them, then he stopped and got down from his mount, called them to Allaah and recited Qur&rsquo;aan to them. This was mentioned in a lengthy \r\n    story that was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> in his commentary on Soorat Aal &lsquo;Imraan, chapter 14.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If it is permissible to mix with the \r\n    mushrikeen, despite the fact that that is sometimes accompanied by rejection or mockery of the truth, then the media may also be used as a \r\n    platform for proclaiming the truth. There is no great difference between mixing with a kaafir and debating with him, in the sense that in both \r\n    cases you will hear opposing views.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;We gave our oath of allegiance to the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), pledging to hear and obey whether at times of ease or hardship, and not to compete \r\n    with those in authority, and to do and speak the truth no matter where we were, without fearing the blame of anyone.&rdquo; Agreed upon.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said: The phrase &ldquo;and to do and \r\n    speak the truth no matter where we were, without fearing the blame of anyone&rdquo; means, to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil at all times \r\n    and in all places, with children and adults, and we will not compromise or fear anyone. <i>Sharh al-Nawawi<\/i>, 12\/230.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the Muslim is required to speak the word \r\n    of truth wherever he is, then that includes the media and means of communication wherever they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    If we refer to the principle of pros and cons, then the benefits of participating in these media clearly outweigh any negative \r\n    factors in several ways:<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    Most of these media have a huge audience of Muslims and non-Muslims, male and female, from all levels of education.

Rather these media have penetrated the majority of homes and imposed \r\n    themselves on the people, and people are exposed to all kinds of ideas and propaganda.

I remind him of the words of Imam Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah, which he wrote in his book <i>al-Hasbah<\/i> about the attitude of some people towards doing good. He said: &ldquo;Some people refrain from \r\n    enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and fighting for the sake of Allaah so that submission will all be to Allaah and the word of \r\n    Allaah will prevail, lest they fall into fitnah, but by refrain thus they fall into fitnah&hellip; This is the state of many religiously committed people \r\n    who fail to do their duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and jihad so that submission will all be to Allaah and the word \r\n    of Allaah will prevail, lest they be tempted with some kind of desires, when they have fallen into a fitnah which is greater than that which they \r\n    are claiming to avoid. Rather what they must do is to do what is enjoined upon them and avoid that which is forbidden, and they are \r\n    interconnected.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is as much as I know, but over all those \r\n    endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allaah).

Every son of \r\n    Adam inevitably commits sin and the best of those who sin are those who continually repent, as it says in the hadeeth. But it is possible for the \r\n    Muslim to live in an Islamic society and adhere to his religion as much as he can, following the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <h1><i><span>\r\n    &ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can&rdquo;<\/span><\/i><\/h1>\r\n    <h1><i><span>\r\n    [al-Taghaabun 64:16 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/span><\/i>&nbsp;<\/h1>\r\n    <p>His religious commitment is not affected by \r\n    some sins that he may commit without meaning to, or that he thinks are permissible according to his own ijtihaad and reasoning and the information \r\n    that he has, or that he asked some scholars about and they gave him a fatwa concerning that but the fatwa was not in accordance with sharee&rsquo;ah. To \r\n    sum up, what the Muslim has to do is to keep his duty towards Allaah and fear Him as much as he can, to regard as forbidden that which Allaah has \r\n    forbidden to him, and to strive to do that which Allaah has enjoined upon him. If he slips or stumbles then he must hasten to repent sincerely.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&rsquo;ah by Shaykh ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 4, p. 417"},{"id":"9724","question_id":"9724","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>We say to this Muslim sister: may Allaah \r\n    reward you with good for adhering to Islam, and we ask Allaah to make you steadfast in Islam and to send you people who will help you to do so. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the question:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly, you have to bear their annoyance \r\n    with patience, because the path of adherence (to Islam) is not easy, but it is the path of the Prophets. The Muslim is bound to face difficulties \r\n    in the way of his adhering to Islam, as Muslim narrated in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> (2823) from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Paradise is surrounded with difficulties and Hell is surrounded with desires.&rdquo; \r\n    The Prophets (peace be upon them) were faced with difficulties from their people and from the closest of people to them, but the reward for their \r\n    patience was that Allaah caused them ultimately to prevail.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Muslim sister should strive to advise her \r\n    family with kindness, wisdom and beautiful preaching, and she should not despair or give up. She should show a good attitude towards them, say and \r\n    do good things to them, and extend a helping hand to them, even to those who cause her the most hardship. This will have an effect on them, in sha \r\n    Allah, and this is one of the most effective ways of calling people to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;She should try to find people to help and \r\n    support her, by trying to persuade those among her family members who like her, because they will be more likely to respond than others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You have to equip yourself with the most \r\n    effective &ldquo;weapon&rdquo;, which is praying for them to be guided and that Allaah will fill their hearts with the light of adherence to Islam. You should \r\n    say such du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s a lot when prostrating and during the last part of the night, and at other times when du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; is especially recommended, and you \r\n    should not try to hasten the response. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Fifthly:<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;You should note that it is not always good \r\n    to break off ties. In some cases, when those whom Allaah has guided break off ties with their families, this makes them go further in their sin \r\n    and farther removed from religious commitment. Breaking off ties may cause a person distress and make him unable to bear it. Hence we think that \r\n    the sister should be patient and mix with her family in ways that will not affect her religious commitment and level of faith. The more she \r\n    withdraws into herself &ndash;i.e., at home &ndash; the better, because if a woman leaves the family home, that may make people talk badly about her a lot, \r\n    and evil-minded people may try to approach because she has gone away from those who could take care of her and protect her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Your staying may be more beneficial to your \r\n    family, because there are many sins that the family may not dare to commit out of respect for their children whom Allaah has guided. If the \r\n    children leave, this will give the family more freedom to commit whatever sins they want.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence the daa&rsquo;iyah should be wise and should \r\n    weigh up the pros and cons of leaving. He should not give a small benefit precedence over warding off a greater evil; warding off evil is more \r\n    important than gaining benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Sixthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is no better du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for such situations \r\n    than the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prayed for his people to be forgiven and guided.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><span>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood said: It is as if I can see the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) telling us the story of one of the Prophets whose people beat him and made him bleed, and he was wiping the blood from his face and saying, \r\n    &ldquo;O Allaah, forgive my people for they do not know.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3290; Muslim, \r\n    1792).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Prophet referred to is one of the earlier \r\n    Prophets.

That may be achieved sometimes by the \r\n    heart, sometimes by the tongue and sometimes by the hand. In the case of the \r\n    heart, this is obligatory in all circumstances because doing it will not \r\n    cause any harm.

If you see an evil action on the part of \r\n    someone that you cannot leave him and go and tell the authorities about it, \r\n    then you have to denounce him straightaway, because it may be too late \r\n    otherwise.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the evil action is major and serious, and you cannot \r\n    denounce it on your own, then you have to inform the authorities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that evil must be removed, whether by your hand \r\n    or the hand of someone else. If that is not possible then it must be done by \r\n    your tongue (by your speaking out), and you should not worry whether they \r\n    listen to you or turn away from you; all you have to do is convey the \r\n    message. Allaah may sow the seeds of guidance in the heart of one of them \r\n    because of your words, but the Shaytaan may also suggest to you that you \r\n    should forget about denouncing them on the basis that they will not listen to you &ndash; so beware of that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"9728","question_id":"9728","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What they are doing is not permissible, firstly because it is \r\n    an obvious lie by which they are claiming to have an excuse.

He is connected \r\n          to his Lord by ties of worship, by turning to Him and beseeching Him. \r\n          He does not need the intercession of priests or rabbis.

Hence you see that the blood of the Muslims&nbsp; is \r\n          shed and has become cheap, and their homes are destroyed and counted \r\n          as worthless, and their lives are counted as cheap because of their \r\n          weakness.

This is in general terms.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          I will explain to you something about the consequences \r\n          of kufr, the details of which are as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <b>1 &ndash; Fear and lack of security<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Allaah has promised those who believe in Him and follow \r\n          His Messengers complete security in this world and in the Hereafter. \r\n          He says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;It is those who believe \r\n          (in the Oneness of Allaah and worship none but Him Alone) and confuse \r\n          not their Belief with Zulm (wrong, i.e. by worshipping others besides \r\n          Allaah), for them (only) there is security and they are the guided&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:82]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Allaah is al-Mu&rsquo;min (the Giver of security) and al-Muhaymin \r\n          (the Watcher over His creatures); He is the Sovereign of all that exists \r\n          in the universe. If Allaah loves a person for his faith then He will \r\n          grant him security, tranquility and contentment. If a man disbelieves \r\n          in Him He will take away his tranquility and security, so you will only \r\n          see him either fearful about his destiny in the Hereafter, or fearing \r\n          sickness for himself, or fearing for his future in this world. This \r\n          is why the insurance business was established, to insure people&rsquo;s lives \r\n          and property, because of the lack of security and the lack of trust \r\n          in Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <b>2 &ndash; A life of hardship<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Allaah has created man and has subjugated to him all \r\n          that is in the universe. He has decreed for every creature its share \r\n          of provision and its life span. So you see the bird going out from its \r\n          nest in the morning to seek its provision, which it picks up, flying \r\n          from branch to branch and singing the most beautiful songs. Man is one \r\n          of these creatures whose provision and lifespan is already allocated. \r\n          If he believes in his Lord and adheres to His laws, He will bless him \r\n          with happiness and stability, and make things easy for him, even if \r\n          he is only given the bare necessities of life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          But if he disbelieves in Him, and arrogantly refuses \r\n          to worship him, He will make his life hard and fill him with worries \r\n          and distress, even if he possesses all kinds of comforts and luxuries. \r\n          Do you not see how many suicides in the world are committed by people \r\n          who have all kinds of luxuries? Do you not see the extravagant spending \r\n          on furniture and travel aimed at enjoying life?&nbsp; What makes people \r\n          spend extravagantly is the fact that their hearts are devoid of faith, \r\n          and their feeling that life is difficult and hard; it is an attempt \r\n          to rid themselves of these feelings by ever-changing means.

Allaah sent His \r\n          Prophet Muhammad \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the same message as \r\n          He sent all the Messengers, namely the call to Tawheed and to worship \r\n          of Allaah alone. He commanded him to establish justice and forbade him \r\n          to do the opposite, i.e., to worship anything other than Allaah, to \r\n          cause division and to transgress against the rights of others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          In these days it has become very common that people who \r\n          claim to have knowledge and to be calling people to good slander many \r\n          of their brothers among the well-known daa&rsquo;iyahs, and they talk about \r\n          the seekers of knowledge, daa&rsquo;iyahs and lecturers. They do that in secret \r\n          in their own gatherings, but it may be recorded on tapes that are distributed \r\n          among the people, and they may do it openly in public lectures in the \r\n          mosques. This behaviour goes against the commands of Allaah and His \r\n          Messenger in several ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1 &ndash; It is a transgression against the rights of the Muslims, \r\n          and against the elite of the people, namely the seekers of knowledge \r\n          and daa&rsquo;iyahs who are striving to make the people aware and to teach \r\n          them and correct their beliefs and practices, and to organize lessons \r\n          and lectures, and to write beneficial books.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; It splits the Muslims and causes division in their \r\n          ranks. They are the most in need of unity and they need to keep away \r\n          from division, discord and too much gossip amongst themselves, especially \r\n          when the daa&rsquo;iyahs who are being slandered are from among the Ahl al-Sunnah \r\n          wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah who are well known for their opposition to bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) \r\n          and myth, and for standing up against those who promote such things, \r\n          and for exposing their plots and tricks. We see no benefit to be gained \r\n          by such actions, except for the enemies who lie in wait for opportunities \r\n          to harm the Muslims, such as the kaafirs, hypocrites and followers of \r\n          bid&rsquo;ah and misguidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; This action offers support and help for the self-serving \r\n          among the secularists, westernizers and other heretics who are well \r\n          known for stirring up trouble among the daa&rsquo;iyahs and telling lies against \r\n          them, and inciting people against them in their writings and recordings. \r\n          It is contrary to Islamic brotherhood for those who are too hasty to \r\n          help their enemies against their brothers among the seekers of knowledge, \r\n          daa&rsquo;iyahs and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          4 &ndash; This spreads corrupts ideas in the hearts and minds \r\n          of the common folk and elite; it spreads and propagates lies and false \r\n          rumours, and causes a great deal of backbiting and slander. It leaves \r\n          the door wide open to evil people who persist in spreading doubts and \r\n          stirring up fitnah, and who are keen to cause harm to the believers \r\n          by accusing them of things that they did not do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          5 &ndash; Much of what is being said has no basis in reality; \r\n          rather these are illusions which the Shaytaan has made attractive to \r\n          them, through which he has tempted them. Allaah says (interpretation \r\n          of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;&ldquo;O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed \r\n          some suspicions are sins.

One of the salaf said: Never think of \r\n          something that is said by your brother as being bad when you still find \r\n          room for a good interpretation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          6 &ndash; Whatever ijtihaad is produced by some scholars or \r\n          seekers of knowledge, in areas where ijtihaad is permitted, the author \r\n          of said ijtihaad cannot be blamed or rebuked for it, so long as he is \r\n          qualified to engage in ijtihaad. If someone else has a different opinion, \r\n          it is better for him to debate with him in a proper manner, striving \r\n          to reach the truth via the shortest route and leaving no room for the \r\n          insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan or for him to cause trouble among \r\n          the believers. If that is not possible, and someone thinks that he has \r\n          no choice but to explain what is wrong with his ijtihaad, then he should \r\n          choose the best wording and the most subtle way of explaining, and not \r\n          resort to attacking, slandering or going to extremes in criticizing \r\n          him, which may cause others to reject the truth or to turn away from \r\n          it. He should also avoid criticizing specific people, casting aspersions \r\n          upon their intentions or saying unnecessary or irrelevant things about \r\n          them. In such cases the Messenger \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would say, &ldquo;What is the \r\n          matter with some people who say such and such&hellip;?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The advice I offer to these brothers who have fallen \r\n          into the sin of slandering the daa&rsquo;iyahs is to repent to Allaah for \r\n          the things that they have written or said that may have corrupted the \r\n          hearts of some youth and filled them with hatred and grudges, and kept \r\n          them from seeking beneficial knowledge or from calling people to Allaah \r\n          by making them preoccupied with gossip and talking about this one and \r\n          that one, and seeking out faults for which they could criticize people, \r\n          and going to extremes in doing that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          I also advise them to offer expiation for the things \r\n          that they have done by writing and other means that they think they \r\n          should not have done, and to remove from people&rsquo;s minds the wrong ideas \r\n          they may have given them. They should focus on fruitful actions which \r\n          will bring them closer to Allaah and will be beneficial to people, and \r\n          they should beware of being too hasty to accuse people of kufr, fisq \r\n          and bid&rsquo;ah without any clear evidence or proof. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever says to his \r\n          brother &lsquo;O kaafir!&rsquo; one of them will be deserving of that description.&rdquo; \r\n          (Saheeh, agreed upon).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          It is prescribed for those who call others to the truth \r\n          and for seekers of knowledge, if they are uncertain about something \r\n          said by a scholar or anyone else, to refer to the prominent scholars \r\n          and to ask them, so that they can explain the facts of the matter to \r\n          them and remove the confusion and doubt from their minds, in accordance \r\n          with the words of Allaah in Soorat al-Nisaa&rsquo; (interpretatiuon of the \r\n          meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>&ldquo;When there comes to them some matter touching (public) \r\n          safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); if only they \r\n          had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority \r\n          among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them \r\n          (directly).

May He unite them in following \r\n          guidance and protect them against all the causes of division and dissent; \r\n          may He support the truth through them and humiliate falsehood through \r\n          them, for He is the One Who is able to do that.

If they had\r\n      mattered to Him, He would have protected them.&rdquo; When a person becomes\r\n      insignificant to Allaah, Allaah will no longer honour him. Allaah says\r\n      (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;And whomsoever Allaah disgraces, none can honour him&rdquo; [al-Hajj\r\n      22:18] &nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>What is amazing is that\r\n      during Ramadaan, you see some people who fast and pray at night, who spend\r\n      in charity and worship the Lord of the Worlds, then no sooner has the\r\n      month come to an end, but their nature changes completely, and they begin\r\n      to have a bad attitude towards their Lord. So you see&nbsp; them neglecting prayer and avoiding righteous deeds, committing\r\n      sins and disobeying Allaah in many different ways, keeping away from\r\n      obedience towards Allaah, the Sovereign, the Holy, the One Free from all\r\n      defects.<\/p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;How terrible it is, by Allaah, when people only\r\n      acknowledge Allaah in Ramadaan.<\/p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;The Muslim should make Ramadaan an opportunity to\r\n      turn over a new leaf by repenting, turning to Allaah, persisting in\r\n      worshipping Allaah, always being aware that Allaah is watching at every\r\n      minute of every hour. So after Ramadaan the Muslim should continue to obey\r\n      Allaah and should avoid sin and evil actions, as a continuation of the way\r\n      he was during Ramadaan and the things that he did then to draw closer to\r\n      the Lord of creation.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;And perform As&#8209;Salaah (Iqaamat&#8209;as&#8209; Salaah),\r\n      at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five\r\n      compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds\r\n      (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those\r\n      who accept advice)&rdquo;[Hood 11:114]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Follow a bad deed\r\n      with a good deed, for it will wipe it out; and have a good attitude and\r\n      good manners towards people.&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>Undoubtedly the purpose for which Allaah created everyone\r\n      was to worship Him Alone, with no partner or associate. This is the\r\n      ultimate purpose and the highest aim, which is to attain &lsquo;uboodiyyah\r\n      (being a slave of Allaah in the truest and fullest sense). This was\r\n      achieved in the most beautiful manner during Ramadaan, when we saw people\r\n      going to the houses of Allaah in groups and individually, and we saw them\r\n      striving to perform the obligatory prayers on time and to give in charity,\r\n      competing with one another in doing good deeds. And for this let (all)\r\n      those strive who want to strive (cf. al-Mutaffifeen 83:26), for they will\r\n      be rewarded in sha Allaah. But there remains the case of those whom Allaah\r\n      keeps firm with the word that stands firm in this world and in the\r\n      Hereafter (cf. Ibraaheem 14:27). Whomever Allaah helps to be steadfast in\r\n      doing righteous deeds after Ramadaan, Allaah says (interpretation of the\r\n      meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;To Him ascend (all) the\r\n      goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are\r\n      not accepted by Allaah unless and until they are followed by good deeds),\r\n      but those who plot evils, theirs will be severe torment. And the plotting\r\n      of such will perish&rdquo;[Faatir 35:10]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>Undoubtedly righteous deeds are among the acts which\r\n      bring a person closer to Allaah at all times, and the Lord of Ramadaan is\r\n      also the Lord of Jumaada and Sha&rsquo;baan and Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijjah and Muharram\r\n      and Safar and all the other months. That is because the worship that\r\n      Allaah has enjoined upon us includes five pillars, one of which is\r\n      fasting, which is for a set period which has come to an end. But there\r\n      remain other pillars, Hajj, prayer and zakaah, for which we are answerable\r\n      to Allaah. We must perform these duties in the manner which is pleasing to\r\n      Allaah, and we must strive thereby to fulfil the purpose for which we were\r\n      created. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that\r\n      they should worship Me (Alone)&rdquo;[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his Companions to\r\n      compete in doing good, and he said, &ldquo;One dirham may weigh more with\r\n      Allaah than a dinar, and the best of charity is that a man gives when he\r\n      is rich.&rdquo; He <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained\r\n      that if the person gives charity when he is disinclined to do so and is in\r\n      good health, but fears poverty, that charity will weigh heavily with\r\n      Allaah in the balance of good deeds; whereas the one who delays it, then\r\n      when he gets sick he starts to spend in charity here and there, fearing\r\n      that his good deeds will be rejected, there is the danger that his\r\n      (charity) will not be accepted &ndash; we seek refuge with Allaah. Allaah says\r\n      (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;Allaah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in\r\n      ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom\r\n      Allaah will forgive and Allaah is Ever All Knower, All&#8209;Wise. <\/p>\r\n      <p>And of no effect is the\r\n      repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of\r\n      them and he says: &ldquo;Now I repent;&rdquo; nor of those who die while they are\r\n      disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful torment&rdquo;[al-Nisaa&rsquo;\r\n      4:17-18]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>The pious and sincere believer should fear Allaah and\r\n      strive to obey Allaah at all times, persisting in his taqwa and always\r\n      striving to do good, call others to Allaah, enjoin what is good and forbid\r\n      what is evil. For the believer, his days and nights in this world are\r\n      storehouses, so let him see what he can deposit in them. If he deposits\r\n      good things in them, it will testify in his favour before his Lord on the\r\n      Day of Resurrection; if it is the opposite, then it will be a disaster for\r\n      him. We ask Allaah to save us and you from that loss.<\/p>\r\n      <p>The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) said:<\/p>\r\n      <p>Among the signs of acceptance (of good deeds) is that Allaah causes\r\n      one hasanah (good deed) to be followed by another, for the hasanah says,\r\n      &ldquo;My sister, my sister!&rdquo; And the sayi&rsquo;ah (evil deed) also says, &ldquo;My\r\n      sister, my sister!&rdquo; &ndash;we seek refuge with Allaah. If Allaah has\r\n      accepted a person's Ramadaan, and he has benefited from this period of\r\n      (spiritual) training and has remained steadfast in obeying Allaah, then he\r\n      has joined the caravan of those who have remained steadfast and responded\r\n      to Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;Verily, those who say:\r\n      &lsquo;Our Lord is Allaah (Alone),&rsquo; and then they stand firm, on them the\r\n      angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): &lsquo;Fear not,\r\n      nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been\r\n      promised!<\/p>\r\n      <p>We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so)\r\n      in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner selves\r\n      desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask&rdquo;[Fussilat\r\n      41:30-31]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;And whosoever takes Allaah, His Messenger,\r\n      and those who have believed, as Protectors, then the party of Allaah will\r\n      be the victorious&rdquo; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:56]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;Verily, those who say: &ldquo;Our Lord is (only)\r\n      Allaah,&rdquo; and thereafter stand firm (on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism),\r\n      on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve&rdquo; [al-Ahqaaf\r\n      46:13] <\/p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;This standing firm should continue from one\r\n      Ramadaan to the next, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of\r\n      Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;From one prayer to the next, from one\r\n      Ramadaan to the next, from one Hajj to the next, this expiates for\r\n      whatever (sins) were committed from one to the next, so long as you avoid\r\n      major sins.&rdquo; And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We\r\n      shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble\r\n      Entrance (i.e. Paradise)&rdquo; [al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:31]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>The believer should join the caravan of those who stand\r\n      firm and should board the ship of salvation from the time when he reaches\r\n      the earliest age of discretion until he draws his last breath. He should\r\n      remain in the shade of &ldquo;Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah&rdquo;, enjoying the\r\n      blessings of Allaah. This religion is the truth and the way in which we\r\n      steadfastly adhere to it in Ramadaan is that with which Allaah honours us\r\n      by the bounty of His giving, His gracious blessing and His great favour,\r\n      so that we might continue to pray qiyaam and to worship Him after\r\n      the month of Ramadaan. Do not forget, my brother, that Allaah has blessed\r\n      you with i&rsquo;tikaaf, and Allaah has blessed you with giving\r\n      charity, and Allaah has blessed you with fasting, and Allaah has blessed\r\n      you with du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; which has been accepted. Do not forget, my brother, to\r\n      take care of these good deeds and this support from Allaah, and do not let\r\n      them be wiped out by bad deeds. So strive to cultivate goodness and\r\n      happiness on your way, and to keep company with those who remain steadfast\r\n      (in Islam), and to seek Allaah and His Messenger and the Home of the\r\n      Hereafter, where it will be said to you, Receive glad tidings of Paradise\r\n      as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the pious, for you\r\n      responded to the call of Allaah; O seeker of good, continue, for Allaah\r\n      has some people who will be freed from Hell, and O seeker of evil, desist.\r\n      And you responded to the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of\r\n      Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;Whoever prays at night during Ramadaan out of\r\n      faith and hoping for reward, his previous sins will be forgiven. And\r\n      whoever prays at night during Laylat al-Qadr out of faith and\r\n      hoping for reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>I ask Allaah Who\r\n      has blessed us and you with fasting, i&rsquo;tikaaf, &lsquo;umrah and charity to\r\n      bless us with guidance, piety, and acceptance of our good deeds; may He\r\n      help us to persist in doing good deeds and to remain steadfast, for\r\n      persistence in doing good deeds is one of the greatest means of drawing\r\n      closer to Allaah. Hence when a man came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and\r\n      blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, &ldquo;Advise me,&rdquo; he said,\r\n      &ldquo;Say, &lsquo;I believe in Allaah,&rsquo; and remain steadfast.&rdquo; (Agreed upon).&nbsp;\r\n      <\/p>\r\n      <p>According to a report narrated by Ahmad, he said, &ldquo;Say,\r\n      I believe in Allaah,&rsquo; then remain steadfast.&rdquo; [The man] said, &ldquo;O\r\n      Messenger of Allaah, all the people say that.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Some people\r\n      who came before you said that, but they did not remain steadfast.&rdquo; So\r\n      the believers must continue to be steadfast in obeying Allaah:<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;Allaah will keep firm\r\n      those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they\r\n      will keep on worshipping Allaah Alone and none else), and in the\r\n      Hereafter. And Allaah will cause to go astray those who are Zaalimoon\r\n      (polytheists and wrongdoers), and Allaah does what He wills&rdquo;[Ibraaheem\r\n      14:27 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>The one who is steadfast in obeying Allaah is the one\r\n      whose du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; will be answered, the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; which he repeats more\r\n      than twenty-five times each day, &ldquo;Guide us to the Straight Way&rdquo;\r\n      [al-Faatihah 1:6 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning], which we say in\r\n      al-Faatihah. Why is it that we say and believe strongly that if we remain\r\n      steadfast Allaah will forgive us, but we are too lazy to apply that in\r\n      practical terms? We should fear Allaah and apply this in deed and thought\r\n      and word. We should strive in the way of &ldquo;ihdinaa al-siraat\r\n      al-mustaqeem (Guide us to the Straight Way)&rdquo;, and we should travel\r\n      the route of &ldquo;iyaaka na&rsquo;budu wa iyyaaka nasta&rsquo;een (You (Alone) we\r\n      worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything))&rdquo;\r\n      [al-Faatihah 1:5 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning], in the shade of\r\n      &ldquo;ihdinaa al-siraat al-mustaqeem (Guide us to the Straight Way)&rdquo;,\r\n      following the route that will lead us to Paradise the width of the heavens\r\n      and the earth, whose key is Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. I ask Allaah to\r\n      grant us and you a good end.<\/p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;After the end of Ramadaan, the people are divided\r\n      into various types, two of the most prominent of which I will describe\r\n      here. The first type are those whom you see in Ramadaan striving hard in\r\n      worship. You never see them but they are prostrating or standing in\r\n      prayer, or reading Qur&rsquo;aan, or weeping, so much that they remind you of\r\n      some of the worshippers among the salaf, and you even feel compassion for\r\n      them because of the intensity of their efforts and striving. Yet hardly\r\n      has the month ended, before they go back to negligence and committing sin,\r\n      as if they were prisoners of that worship, so they turn their attention to\r\n      their desires and become negligent and commit sins which they think will\r\n      take away their distress and grief. But these poor people forget that sin\r\n      is the cause of doom, because sins are like war wounds, one of which may\r\n      turn out to be fatal. How often has sin prevented a person from saying Laa\r\n      ilaaha ill-Allaah when in the throes of death.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>After spending this entire month with faith, (reading) Qur&rsquo;aan and\r\n      other acts of worship, these people then backslide, Laa hawla wa laa\r\n      quwwata illa Billaah (there is no power and no strength except with\r\n      Allaah).&nbsp; These are the\r\n      occasional worshippers who only acknowledge Allaah on certain occasions or\r\n      at times of calamity and distress, then after that there is no more\r\n      obedience or worship. What a bad habit that is.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;The worshipper prayed for something that he wanted,\r\n      and when the matter was done, he neither prayed nor fasted.&rdquo; [Arabic\r\n      poetry]<\/p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;I wonder what is the point of worshipping for a\r\n      whole month, if that is going to be followed by a return to dishonourable\r\n      ways?<\/p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;The second type are those who feel distressed at\r\n      the departure of Ramadaan, because they have tasted the sweetness of being\r\n      safe from sin, and the bitterness of patience became insignificant to\r\n      them, because they came to realize the true nature of their weakness and\r\n      need for their Master (Allaah) and their need to obey Him. They fasted in\r\n      a true sense and stood in prayer at night out of love, so when they bade\r\n      farewell to Ramadaan, their tears flowed and their hearts were broken.\r\n      Those among them who were burdened with sin hoped to be freed from sin and\r\n      ransomed from Hell, and to join the caravan of those who are accepted. Ask\r\n      yourself, my brother, which of the two groups do you belong to?&nbsp;\r\n      <\/p>\r\n      <p>By Allaah, are they the same? Praise be to Allaah, but\r\n      most of them do not know. The mufassireen said, commenting on the aayah\r\n      (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n      <p>&ldquo;Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &lsquo;Each one does according to\r\n      Shakilatihi (i.e. his way or his religion or his intentions)&hellip;&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n      <p>[al-Israa&rsquo; 17:84] &ndash; every person acts according to his\r\n      way or the character that he is used to. This is condemnation for the\r\n      kaafir and praise for the believer.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>You should know that the dearest of deeds to Allaah are\r\n      those that are continuous, even if they are little. The Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O people, you must do\r\n      whatever you can of good deeds, for Allaah does not get tired until you\r\n      get tired. The most beloved of deeds to Allaah are those which are\r\n      continuous, even if they are little. The family of Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace\r\n      and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when they did something, they would\r\n      persist in doing it.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n      upon him) was asked about which deeds are most beloved to Allaah, he said,\r\n      &ldquo;Those which are continuous, even if they are little.&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n      <p>&lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was asked\r\n      about what the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n      upon him) did and whether he used to do certain things on particular days.\r\n      She said, &ldquo;No, his good deeds were continuous. Who among you could do\r\n      what the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n      him) used to do?&rdquo; The acts of worship prescribed in Islam are based on\r\n      certain conditions which must be fulfilled, like remembrance of Allaah,\r\n      Hajj and &lsquo;Umrah and their naafil actions, enjoining what is good and\r\n      forbidding what is evil, seeking knowledge, jihaad, and other good deeds.\r\n      So strive to worship continuously according to your capability.&nbsp;\r\n      <\/p>\r\n      <p>May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and\r\n      companions, and grant them peace.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: From al-Da&rsquo;wah magazine, issue no. 1774, p. 12"},{"id":"9743","question_id":"9743","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim is obliged to adhere to the teachings of his \r\n    religion and perform the obligatory duties of praying, fasting, honouring \r\n    his parents, upholding the ties of kinship, speaking truthfully and other \r\n    duties that Allaah has enjoined upon him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He must also avoid that which has been forbidden, such as \r\n    zina (unlawful sexual relations), riba (usury or interest), drinking \r\n    alcohol, disobeying parents, lying, treachery, consuming people&rsquo;s wealth \r\n    unlawfully and other forbidden things.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is obligatory upon every Muslim.

Hence it was narrated that Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) said: &ldquo;You will never tell a people anything that they do \r\n    not understand but it will be a cause of confusion for some of them.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence it is wise when calling people to Islam not to \r\n    overwhelm the people with things that they cannot understand, rather one \r\n    should call them gradually, so that they may gradually comprehend what you \r\n    are telling them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The phrase &ldquo;do you want them to reject Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger?&rdquo; means: If you tell the people things that they do not \r\n    appreciate, do you want them to reject Allaah and His Messenger? Because if \r\n    you say &ldquo;Allaah said such and such and His Messenger said such and such,&rdquo; \r\n    they will say, This is a lie, if it is beyond their comprehension, and in \r\n    that case they will not be disbelieving Allaah and His Messenger, rather \r\n    they will be disbelieving you and the words you attribute to Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger, thus they will be ultimately disbelieving Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger, not directly but via the one who told them that. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;If it is said: Should we forego speaking of that which \r\n    people do not understand even though they are in need of that? My answer is: \r\n    We should not forego that, but we should tell them in a way that is \r\n    acceptable to them, by telling them gradually, until they accept this idea \r\n    and feel at ease with it, and we should not ignore that which they cannot \r\n    understand and say that this is something objectionable so we should not \r\n    speak of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: Following the Sunnah which the people are not \r\n    used to and find objectionable. We should follow it, but after we tell them \r\n    of it, until their hearts accept it and feel at ease with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may be understood from this report the importance of \r\n    wisdom in calling people to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and \r\n    that the daa&rsquo;iyah must have insight into the mentality of the people he is \r\n    calling, and use a different approach for each individual.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> \r\n    (10\/774, 775).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you have to follow the path of wisdom in calling these \r\n    people to give up communal dhikr and the other innovations that they do, and \r\n    to follow the Sunnahs that they are ignoring.

It could be that what we mentioned above (the king&rsquo;s victory) coincided \r\n  with the onset of the moderate weather of autumn and they continued to celebrate \r\n  it. It is celebrated on October 26 in the ancient Syriac calendar.

The imaamah (Islamic political leadership)\r\n    has been prescribed for the purpose of establishing the religion of Allaah. No one should\r\n    think that the fact that there is no imaam at any given time in any given country means\r\n    that we can be negligent and introverted and not practise or establish any aspect of the\r\n    religion. Among the people of misguidance during this age and at other times there are\r\n    those who say that we do not need to establish any of the symbols of Islam until a\r\n    khaleefah has been appointed over the Muslims and the Islamic state has been established.\r\n    This is one of the worst kinds of misguidance, and believing this leads to abandoning\r\n    Jumu&#146;ah prayers, prayer in jamaa&#146;ah, Hajj, jihaad, collecting zakaah, prayer for\r\n    rain (istisqaa&#146;), Eid prayers, appointing imaams for mosques, calling the adhaan and\r\n    other things, which amounts to cancelling the rulings of Islam.

No doubt occupying\r\n    oneself with these things is the most important thing, and each person should do\r\n    everything that he is able to do.

When the Muslim ummah adhered to its religion at the \r\n    beginning of Islam, it had power, might and strength, and were advanced in \r\n    all aspects of life. Indeed, some people say that the west did not advance \r\n    in different branches of knowledge except after learning and taking \r\n    knowledge from the Muslims in the early centuries of Islam. But the Muslim \r\n    ummah started to fall short in its commitment to its religion and introduced \r\n    into the religion of Allaah things that are not part of it, in terms of \r\n    beliefs, words and actions. That led to falling behind and becoming backward \r\n    to a large extent. We know for certain, and Allaah is our witness, that if \r\n    we go back to what our forebears followed in religious terms, we would \r\n    become great and honoured and would prevail over all people. Hence, when Abu \r\n    Sufyaan spoke to Heraclius, the Byzantine ruler &ndash; and Byzantium at that time \r\n    was regarded as a superpower &ndash; and told him about the way of the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions, he \r\n    said: &ldquo;If what you are saying is true, then he will take possession of what \r\n    lies beneath these two feet of mine.&rdquo; When Abu Sufyaan and his companions \r\n    left Heraclius, he said: &ldquo;The affair of Ibn Abi Kabshah is becoming so \r\n    serious that the king of Banu&rsquo;l-Asfar [i.e., the Byzantines] is afraid of \r\n    him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what has happened in the western kaafir and \r\n    atheist states of progress in terms of industry and the like, our religion \r\n    does not forbid that, if we follow its teachings. But unfortunately we have \r\n    lost both. We have neglected our religion and we have neglected our worldly \r\n    affairs. But Islam is not contrary to such progress; rather Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And make ready against them all you can of power, \r\n    including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery) to threaten the \r\n    enemy of Allaah and your enemy, and others besides whom, you may not know \r\n    but whom Allaah does know. And whatever you shall spend in the Cause of \r\n    Allaah shall be repaid unto you, and you shall not be treated unjustly.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Anfaal 8:60]&nbsp;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. \r\n    easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the \r\n    path thereof and eat of His provision.

These kaafir nations were originally kaafir, and the religions \r\n    that they followed were false religions; their religion and their rejection \r\n    of their religion is all the same, with no difference. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will \r\n    never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:85]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Although the Jews and Christians have some characteristics in \r\n    which they differ from others, with regard to the Hereafter they and others \r\n    will all be the same. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) swore that any Jew or Christian among this nation who heard of \r\n    him and did not follow what he brought would be among the people of Hell. So \r\n    they are basically kaafirs, whether they follow Judaism or Christianity or \r\n    not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what they have of rain and other blessings, \r\n    this happens to them as a test from Allaah, to hasten their good things for \r\n    them in this world, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said to &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab, when he saw the marks of his reed \r\n    mat on his side, and &lsquo;Umar wept and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, the \r\n    Persians and Romans [Byzantines] are living a live of ease and you are in \r\n    this state.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;O &lsquo;Umar, these are people for whom their good things \r\n    have been hastened in this world. Doesn&rsquo;t it please you that this world \r\n    should be for them and the Hereafter should be for us?&rdquo; Moreover, they are \r\n    faced with drought, calamities, earthquakes and destructive storms, as is \r\n    well known and is always broadcast in the media, in newspapers and \r\n    elsewhere. But those who make the claim referred to in the question are \r\n    blind; Allaah has blinded them to the truth and they do not know what is \r\n    really going on. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My advice to them is to repent to Allaah from such thoughts \r\n    before death takes them unawares, and to turn back to their Lord. They \r\n    should realize that we will have no might or pride or strength or leadership \r\n    unless we come back to the religion of Islam in a true sense, in word and \r\n    deed. They should realize that the path these kuffaar are following is false \r\n    and is not true, and their final destiny will be the Fire, as Allaah has \r\n    told us in His Book and on the lips of His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). This blessing that Allaah has given them \r\n    of ease is nothing more than a test and a trial, and hastening of good \r\n    things in this world, until they die and leave behind this comfort and go to \r\n    Hell, where the loss, pain and grief will be increased for them. This is the \r\n    wisdom of Allaah behind the ease that these people enjoy. But as you say, \r\n    they are not free of calamities that befall them, such as earthquakes, \r\n    droughts, storms, floods and so on. I ask Allaah to guide this questioner \r\n    and bring him back to the truth, and to give us all insight into our \r\n    religion, for He is Most Generous, Most Kind.

He (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n      upon him) sent the daa&lsquo;iyahs to call the people to Islam, and he taught \r\n      them to start first of all with Tawheed or the Oneness of Allah, then the \r\n      prayer, then zakaah, then fasting, then Hajj when the time for it came. He \r\n      sent Mu&lsquo;aadh to Yemen and told him to call them first of all to Tawheed, \r\n      belief in the Oneness of Allah. If they responded to that, then he was to \r\n      call them to pray. If they responded to that, then he was to call them to \r\n      give zakaah. He did not mention fasting and Hajj because when he sent \r\n      Mu&lsquo;aadh, it was not the time for these acts of worship, as he sent him in \r\n      Rabee&lsquo; al-Awwal of 10 AH. There was still some time to go before Hajj, and \r\n      also fasting. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in \r\n      his wisdom did not want to spring all the rulings of Islam at once on \r\n      those who were being called to the faith. This is part of the wisdom \r\n      mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Invite \r\n      (mankind, O Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span>) \r\n      to the way of your Lord (i.e. Isl&acirc;m) with wisdom&rdquo; [al-Nahl 16:125]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But should one start, straight after a person has entered \r\n    Islam, with rulings on minor issues such as the beard, isbaal (letting the \r\n    hem of one&rsquo;s clothes come below the ankle) and so on?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This should be based on what is referred to above, that the \r\n    best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him). So he should start first of all with the basics of Islam, \r\n    until Islam is settled in his heart and he is at ease in his new faith. At \r\n    that point we may teach him other matters, starting with the most important, \r\n    then the next most important and so on. This is the way of Allah with regard \r\n    to both shar&lsquo;i rulings and laws of nature.

Temptation could make people crazy \r\n    and ruin their lives, and the Muslim has no refuge except his Lord, from \r\n    Whom he should seek help to be steadfast in adhering to the truth and to \r\n    overcome his own self (nafs) that is inclined towards evil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We hope that Allah has helped us to give the right advice and \r\n    we ask Him to enable our sisters to act upon it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah is the Source of strength<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9758","question_id":"9758","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Messages that people usually sent on special occasions are \r\n      of two types:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those that people send on Eids and occasions on which it is \r\n    Islamically prescribed to congratulate one another or that are sent with the \r\n    aim of reminding people to do particular acts of worship that have to do \r\n    with the time when they are sent, such as sending messages to remind people \r\n    to pray qiyaam during Ramadan or to read Qur&rsquo;aan during that month, or \r\n    reminders to fast on some days of special virtue and the like.

People are undoubtedly affected by their environment, hence there is \r\n    a stern warning against settling among the mushrikeen and those who are \r\n    morally bankrupt. We think that if you were living in a decent, conservative \r\n    environment, you would not be feeling this way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We are sorry to see that in your question that you went \r\n    beyond asking questions in seeking to understand, to the extent of impugning \r\n    the laws and wisdom of Allah, and differentiating between faith in Allah, \r\n    may He be exalted, and the laws of Islam. The laws of Islam came from Allah \r\n    in the first place; they come from Him and from nowhere else. So it is \r\n    better to phrase such objections in the form of questions that are aimed at \r\n    removing doubt, and not in this style or form.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have mixed up the rulings of Islam and the actions of \r\n    Muslims. The laws of Islam are pure and were prescribed by Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, to set straight the affairs of people and countries. Whatever the \r\n    Muslims do that is contrary to the laws of their Lord can only be attributed \r\n    to them, not to their religion. The religion of Allah does not permit males \r\n    to drink alcohol or to make friends with non-mahram women or to commit zina \r\n    (fornication or adultery). How can you attribute these evil deeds and major \r\n    sins that are committed by the misguided youth to the laws of Allah, and \r\n    claim that He permits that to them [males] and forbids them to females? You \r\n    are mistaken and confused. You have made a mistake by attributing their \r\n    actions to Islam and you are confused in your belief that these actions are \r\n    permissible for males and not females.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You said some objectionable words in your question, which are \r\n    very wrong and pose a danger to your religious commitment, so you have to \r\n    repent from them and regret them. Among the worst of them are your words, \r\n    &ldquo;why do people say that Islam is the greatest religion on earth if it&rsquo;s so \r\n    unfair and cruel?&rdquo; These are words which, if they were spoken by one who \r\n    understood their meanings, they would be tantamount to apostasy in his case. \r\n    They imply impugning of Allah, may He be exalted, which is a serious matter. \r\n    Perhaps your excuse is that you were confused between the laws of Allah and \r\n    the actions of some Muslims. Islam is the religion of Allah and it is what \r\n    He has prescribed. It is what He revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Truly, the religion with Allaah is Islam&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:19]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will \r\n    never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:85]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Accusing Islam of being unjust and cruel is one of the \r\n    falsest of falsehoods. Allah says, negating the first accusation \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, Allaah enjoins Al&#8209;&lsquo;Adl (i.e. justice and \r\n    worshipping none but Allaah Alone &mdash; Islamic Monotheism) and Al&#8209;Ihs&acirc;n [i.e. \r\n    to be patient in performing your duties to Allaah, totally for Allaah&rsquo;s sake \r\n    and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet\r\n    <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609;&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span> in a perfect manner], \r\n    and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allaah has ordered you to \r\n    give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of \r\n    help), and forbids Al&#8209;Fahsh&acirc;&rsquo; (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual \r\n    acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false \r\n    witness, to kill a life without right), and Al&#8209;Munkar (i.e. all that is \r\n    prohibited by Islamic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every \r\n    kind of evil deeds), and Al&#8209;Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He \r\n    admonishes you, that you may take heed&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nahl 16:90].<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And He says, negating the second accusation:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make \r\n    things difficult for you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Yoonus 10:32]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Messenger of Allah (sa) said: &ldquo;Allaah did not send me to \r\n    make things hard for people in the hope that they would make mistakes, \r\n    rather He sent me to teach and make things easy.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim, 1478.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him) said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (sa): Which religion is \r\n    most beloved to Allah? He said: &ldquo;al-Haneefiyyah al-Samhah (easy \r\n    monotheism).&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle with regard to the commands and \r\n    prohibitions is that there is no differentiation between males and females \r\n    with regard to them. There is no need to point out that this applies to all \r\n    rulings, but we find that in the case of some prohibitions, Allah mentions \r\n    both sexes, and this confirms what we say, which is that there is basically \r\n    no difference between the sexes, especially with regard to things that are \r\n    forbidden in Islam. For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off \r\n    (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which \r\n    they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah. And Allaah is \r\n    All&#8209;Powerful, All&#8209;Wise&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:38]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them \r\n    with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a \r\n    punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. \r\n    And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:2]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (iii)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking \r\n    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual \r\n    acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All&#8209;Aware of what they do.<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>31.&nbsp;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from \r\n    looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal \r\n    sexual acts)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:30. 31]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, we should tell you that there are some things that \r\n    are forbidden for men but permissible for women, because they are \r\n    appropriate for women&rsquo;s nature but arenot appropriate for men. It was \r\n    narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash&lsquo;ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allah, \r\n    may He be glorified and exalted, has permitted silk and gold to the females \r\n    of my ummah, and has forbidden them to the males.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ahmad (19184) and al-Nasaa&rsquo;i (5265); classed as \r\n    saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We should also tell you that the differences in the physical \r\n    makeup of both genders may dictate variation in some rulings, but in the \r\n    context of reward and status with Allah, this variation becomes \r\n    insignificant and each person will be rewarded in accordance with his effort \r\n    and his situation; no one will be wronged and no deed will be undervalued; \r\n    no one will be brought to account for something they did not do. Allah, may \r\n    He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, \r\n    and is a (true) believer [in the Oneness of Allaah (Muslim)], such will \r\n    enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a Naqeera \r\n    (speck on the back of a date stone), will be done to them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:124]<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Whosoever does an evil deed, will not be requited except \r\n    the like thereof; and whosoever does a righteous deed, whether male or \r\n    female and is a true believer (in the Oneness of Allaah), such will enter \r\n    Paradise, where they will be provided therein (with all things in abundance) \r\n    without limit&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Ghaafir 40:60]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is this sufficient for you to realise how wrong you are in \r\n    thinking that haraam things are permissible for males and not females? From \r\n    this you will realise that your saying &ldquo;why is it okay for a boy to go out \r\n    and get so drunk he can&rsquo;t walk properly and sleep with a million different \r\n    girls?&rdquo; has no basis in truth. Alcohol and zina (fornication) are major sins \r\n    and no differentiation is made with regard to them between males and \r\n    females; both of them -- if they do these things -- incur the burden of sin \r\n    and deserve the prescribed punishment. If many people differentiate in this \r\n    matter by allowing their sons to do this but not their daughters, that is \r\n    due to the temptation of the Shaytaan and does not stem from the laws of the \r\n    Most Merciful.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is there any reason or wisdom, is there any justice or \r\n    fairness in anything if you regard the deeds of evildoers and immoral people \r\n    and the filth of addicts and fornicators as the criteria to judge the \r\n    religion of the Lord of the Worlds??&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your saying, &ldquo;some Muslims seem to think it&rsquo;s okay to marry a \r\n    fifteen-year-old girl to some thirty-year-old man she's never met before, \r\n    why is that okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These words are unfair and contrary to the reality that you \r\n    want to judge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please take note of what we are going to tell you:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A marriage can never take place between a thirty-year-old man \r\n    and a fifteen year old girl, between that girl and a man of whatever age she \r\n    wants, except with her agreement. What harm will it do you if a man of that \r\n    age proposes marriage to you when you are at the age you are at, then you \r\n    accept it and want to marry him, and you tell your guardian to go ahead with \r\n    that? What if she is thirty years old and he is forty-five? So what? The \r\n    fact that she did not accept this husband before does not mean anything. The \r\n    matter is for her to decide, if she wants that and agrees to it after asking \r\n    about him and making enquiries about him; and if she wants she can reject \r\n    him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, if she has met him before -- as happens among those \r\n    who act contrary to sharee&lsquo;ah and have haraam relationships -- that does not \r\n    mean that their marriage will be happy; rather most of what you hear about \r\n    husbands beating their wives, wives killing their husbands, divorce, \r\n    separation and marital infidelity -- all of that, in the society in which \r\n    you are living and others like it -- happens between spouses who knew one \r\n    another and met one another before marriage, and in many cases had a child \r\n    or children. Did that meeting before marriage benefit them at all?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As a thirty-year-old man can marry a fifteen-year-old girl, \r\n    so too a man of twenty can marry a woman of thirty or even forty. So what? \r\n    What matters is the fact that both agree and consent to the marriage. What \r\n    harm does it do if there is a difference in age between the spouses? Is \r\n    there any marriage that was happier than the marriages of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to Khadeejah and &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah? His \r\n    marriage to Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her) took place when she \r\n    was nearly twice his age, and his marriage to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah took place when he \r\n    was much older than her, but they were among the most successful of \r\n    marriages on earth. So when did the difference in ages between the spouses \r\n    in and of itself have a negative impact on the marriage?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Your saying &ldquo;Why is it that when a Muslim girl strikes out on \r\n    her own and wants to do something with her life she can&rsquo;t because Islam is \r\n    holding her back?&rdquo; is not correct, because Islam does not prevent a woman \r\n    from going out on her own to the mosque or to the marketplace or to the \r\n    houses of her family, relatives and neighbours. Rather what is forbidden is \r\n    for her to travel on her own without a mahram, and the accompaniment of a \r\n    mahram when travelling is only prescribed in order to protect her from those \r\n    who would mess with her and cause her harm. Perhaps you see in the country \r\n    in which you live that women are not safe if they go out alone to the \r\n    marketplace or to work, and they are aware that the &ldquo;wolves&rdquo; of the streets \r\n    are waiting for them. When Islam prescribes something that is aimed at \r\n    protecting women, that is not mistreatment of them; rather it is because \r\n    Islam holds them in high esteem and shows great respect to them, as well as \r\n    paying attention to their weakness and their need for someone else who will \r\n    protect and guard them against evildoers who would do them harm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, every wise person realises that women need \r\n    protection and care more then men, and the need to protect girls against \r\n    going astray or falling victim to aggression is even greater. If she loses \r\n    her virginity or becomes pregnant or her honour is physically tarnished, \r\n    that may affect her and her future, and it may be difficult for her to \r\n    conceal it. As for boys, there is no differentiation between a boy and girl \r\n    with regard to the shar&lsquo;i punishment in this world or the recompense in the \r\n    Hereafter, but a boy -- at least -- can conceal his misdemeanour, and its \r\n    effect and shame are not apparent in his case. Moreover, he is not the one \r\n    for whom aggression is feared; he is the one who is the aggressor and the \r\n    girl is the target and victim. So which of them is more deserving of being \r\n    protected, guarded, watched over and cared for? <i>&ldquo;if you but knew&rdquo; [Nooh \r\n    71:4]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sixthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for your saying &ldquo;why is it not okay for a Muslim woman to \r\n    marry a non-Muslim man when she's fallen in love with him but it's perfectly \r\n    fine for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim lady?&rdquo;, this is a very strange \r\n    comment! Can these be the words of one who believes in Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, as her Lord and describes herself as a Muslim? Where is the faith \r\n    in the name of Allah al-Hakam (the Most Wise), and where is the belief in \r\n    your Lord&rsquo;s attribute of wisdom? Where is the submission to His commands and \r\n    prohibitions? Now you want any Muslim woman who falls in love with a \r\n    Buddhist or Hindu man to be able to marry him! Do you believe that Islam \r\n    allows men to marry female idolaters, Communists or Buddhists? This is a \r\n    mistaken notion. It is not permissible for Muslim men to marry kaafir women, \r\n    except those who are Jews or Christians; it is not permissible for them to \r\n    marry women of any other religions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of a Muslim woman, it is haraam for her to marry \r\n    anyone of any other religion apart from Islam. This is a matter on which \r\n    there is scholarly consensus and there are no differences concerning that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is very strange that you want a Muslim woman be able to \r\n    marry any kaafir she falls in love with, whilst many kaafirs do not allow \r\n    their daughters to marry Muslim men even if they fall in love with them! \r\n    Buddhists and Hindus do not give their daughters in marriage to Muslims. \r\n    Indeed there are some Christian denominations who do not marry one another! \r\n    How did it occur to you that Islam does not take care of Muslim women and \r\n    allows them to marry men of any religion, so that could lead to them being \r\n    driven away from their religion?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please see the answer to question number\r\n    [fatin]83736[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Seventhly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to your saying &ldquo;why do the men get to choose who \r\n    they want to marry but sometimes woman gets no say in it at all? Why is it \r\n    so unfair?&rdquo; your mistake is very clear and obvious. In fact the woman may \r\n    choose just as the man may choose; in fact her right to choose is greater \r\n    than his. The woman who receives marriage proposals can choose whoever she \r\n    wants and reject all the others. In fact she may choose a man who suits her, \r\n    whereas it may not be easy for a man to propose to more than one or two. All \r\n    the choices made by men in fact create choices for the woman, because she \r\n    has the right to refuse him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The tradition is for the woman to be makhtoobah (proposed to) \r\n    and not khaatibah (the one who proposes); for her to be mankoohah (the one \r\n    who is married) and not naahikah (one who marries); for her to be matloobah \r\n    (the one who is sought) not taalibah (the one who seeks). This is something \r\n    that is deeply rooted in the nature of the sons of Adam and indeed other \r\n    living beings: the female is usually the one who is sought.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Despite that, there is no reason in sharee&lsquo;ah, if a woman \r\n    likes a man, for her not to express her wish to marry him. But that should \r\n    not be done in an appropriate manner. So she should not propose to him or be \r\n    the one who marries him; rather he is the one who proposes and she is the \r\n    one who is proposed to; he is the one who marries and she is the one who is \r\n    married.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eighthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, you should understand that Islam honour woman as a \r\n    daughter, a mother and a wife: it protects her rights that have been taken \r\n    from her. In its laws it pays attention to woman&rsquo;s weakness and emotional \r\n    nature. So it prescribes for her that which will protect her honour and \r\n    dignity. What you see of loss of honour and transgression against women in \r\n    the form of assault and rape is only because of the bad conduct of men who \r\n    have lost all mercy and compassion, and who have lost all sense that Allah \r\n    is always watching them; it is also because of women showing their \r\n    adornments and being heedless about mixing, shaking hands, working and \r\n    corresponding with men. If women adhered to the laws of Allah in their \r\n    clothing and by not mixing with men or travelling alone, and if they adhered \r\n    to Islamic guidelines on talking to men and looking at them, a great deal of \r\n    evil and mischief in society would come to an end.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no doubt that allowing women to mix freely with men \r\n    is the basis of all calamities and evils, and it is one of the greatest \r\n    causes of bringing punishment upon the entire community. It is also one of \r\n    the causes of corruption in both public and private affairs. And mixing of \r\n    men with women is a cause of many immoral actions and zina, and it is one of \r\n    the causes of widespread death and ongoing plagues.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah<\/i>, p. 405&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please also see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]40405[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our advice to you is to beware of the tricks of the Shaytaan, \r\n    to venerate your Lord, may He be exalted, be proud of your religion and \r\n    express your appreciation of the Prophet of Islam (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him). You should understand that life is not sex, such that \r\n    you should focus only on that issue. Islam is all great and its rulings are \r\n    all in the interests of both individuals and societies at all times and in \r\n    all places. Wise people in the West are entering the religion of Allah in \r\n    crowds, not in order to flatter anyone, but because of what they see of the \r\n    greatness of its laws and its suitability to all times and places. These \r\n    wise people differentiate between what they know of Islam and what they see \r\n    of the actions of some Muslims. So think again about what you said and take \r\n    another look at your verdict on Islam: you will see the greatness of this \r\n    religion and that you are enjoying a blessing of which millions of people \r\n    are deprived.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9761","question_id":"9761","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    First of all, we are happy to congratulate you on the great \r\n    blessing that Allah has bestowed upon you, which is the blessing of Islam. \r\n    Perhaps you felt the greatness of this blessing because of what you have \r\n    seen in the changes in your situation and your feeling content, happy and \r\n    peaceful. All of that is what Allah gives to those who utter the \r\n    Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith) and that blessing increases as you \r\n    act upon the rulings of Islam. We ask Allah to make you steadfast in \r\n    adhering to His religion and to complete His blessings upon you both \r\n    outwardly and inwardly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should note two important issues that have to do with \r\n    prayer:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no excuse for the Muslim not to pray, no matter what \r\n    his circumstances. In the case of a woman, she stops praying at the time of \r\n    menstruation and nifaas (postpartum bleeding), but apart from that there is \r\n    no excuse for anyone not to pray. The fighter on the battlefield prays, the \r\n    one who is in prison prays, the one who is sick prays; that is because of \r\n    the great importance of this obligatory duty according to the laws of \r\n    Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the event of extreme or unusual difficulty in performing \r\n    some religious duties, then Allah make it easier for him (by granting \r\n    concessions). Because Islam enjoins the Muslim to pray no matter what the \r\n    circumstances, there may be some concessions with regard to the rulings. So \r\n    he should do whatever he can, and whatever he cannot do or is too difficult \r\n    for him to do, is waived in his case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In your situation, as you have described it to us, we say to \r\n    you:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should note that the basic principle concerning prayer is \r\n    that it should be offered in a state of purity, covering the body, facing \r\n    the qiblah and doing all the essential parts (&ldquo;pillars&rdquo;) and obligatory \r\n    parts, adhering to the times prescribed in sharee&lsquo;ah. Part of the easy \r\n    nature of this religion is that it pays attention to the circumstances and \r\n    situations of people who are praying, and it does not enjoin the Muslim to \r\n    do what he is unable to do or what is too difficult for him to do. There may \r\n    be a sick person in his bed, or a fighter on the battlefield, or a prisoner \r\n    who is tied up, or one who is afraid to practice his Islam openly and pray \r\n    openly &ndash; as in your case. In all these cases and similar cases, people are \r\n    not required to do anything except that which is within their capability, \r\n    and whatever they cannot do is waived. At the same time it is confirmed that \r\n    their prayer is valid and they do not have to repeat it at all.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In many of our answers we have stated that which is \r\n    appropriate to your situation of rulings having to do with your prayer, such \r\n    as the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is permissible for you to do \r\n    the essential parts and obligatory parts of the prayer whilst sitting or \r\n    lying down, making gestures to indicate bowing and prostrating.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It is permissible for you to \r\n    put two prayers together if it is not possible for you to offer each prayer \r\n    at its own time, or if there is sufficient time for you to offer two prayers \r\n    together when you are in the best state with regard to purity, clothing and \r\n    being able to do the essential parts and obligatory parts. So you could put \r\n    Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr together at the time of either of them, and put Maghrib and \r\n    &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; together at the time of either of them. This is a concession granted \r\n    by sharee&lsquo;ah to everyone who is in a situation such as yours. In fact, if \r\n    you are unable even to do this and you cannot offer each prayer at the right \r\n    time even if you are sitting or lying down, or by gesturing, and you are not \r\n    able to put two prayers together in the manner described, then you should \r\n    offer whatever you can at the proper time, and for the prayers that you \r\n    miss, you can offer them at whatever time is easy for you, when you are away \r\n    from where your family can see you.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If you cannot do wudoo&rsquo; or \r\n    ghusl, then tayammum is acceptable in your case as an alternative to them.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For more information on the issues mentioned above, see the \r\n    answer to question no.

This is a blessing from \r\n    Allah, as the one who is so blessed does not need to seek through different \r\n    religions to find the true religion that Allah loves and is pleased with, \r\n    and does not accept any other religion. The individual has not done anything \r\n    to attain this favour; rather it is pure grace from Allah his Lord, may He \r\n    be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But this does not mean that everyone who is born to Muslim \r\n    parents understands the extent of this blessing and acts in gratitude for \r\n    it. Rather we see many, many people who are ungrateful for this blessing and \r\n    do not benefit at all from the fact that from the moment they opened their \r\n    eyes on this world, they saw Islam and the mosque, and the first thing they \r\n    heard was the word of Tawheed. Hence these people go astray and follow paths \r\n    of misguidance and kufr, and they are Muslim in nothing but name, and some \r\n    of those who are seeking for the true religion may be better than them &ndash; \r\n    although it is not correct to make such comparisons &ndash;when they come to know \r\n    that Islam is the religion of Allah and He does not accept any other \r\n    religion from His slaves, and they read and ponder until they enter this \r\n    religion with conviction and adhere strongly to its rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence the matter is nothing more than additional grace that \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, bestows upon whomever He wills among His slaves \r\n    that they should be born Muslim. However He does not wrong others, as He has \r\n    made clear to them the paths of guidance and misguidance, and has shown them \r\n    His straight path and enjoined them to follow it, and has shown them the \r\n    ways of the Shaytaan and warned them against following them. And you see \r\n    some of those who were born to Muslim parents yet they go astray, and you \r\n    see some of those who were born to kaafir parents following true guidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the clear examples concerning this matter which will \r\n    dispel your confusion is what you know about the situation of some of the \r\n    Messengers and their call and the response to it. We see Nooh (peace be upon \r\n    him); what did it benefit his son and his wife, when he was the Prophet sent \r\n    by Allah who called them night and day, but they did not respond and they \r\n    died in kufr. What did it benefit the father of Ibraaheem (peace be upon \r\n    him) when his son persisted in calling him, advising him and exhorting him, \r\n    but he rejected that and even played a role in throwing him into the fire? \r\n    What did it benefit the wife of Loot, even though she was the wife of a \r\n    Prophet sent by Allah and he called her to the truth, but she insisted on \r\n    following kufr? Yet at the same time we see Pharaoh, who was one of the \r\n    greatest tyrants on earth, yet his wife declared her Islam and disbelieved \r\n    in her husband. This is how human beings are; either Allah bestows upon some \r\n    of them the blessing of Islam, and they are grateful for it and strive to \r\n    adhere to it, and some are deprived of this blessing but they put a great \r\n    deal of effort into seeking until they arrive at the truth that Allah, may \r\n    He be exalted, revealed and commanded His slaves to follow His path. And \r\n    both parties must always say (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;All the \r\n    praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has guided us to this, never could we \r\n    have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us&rdquo; [al-A &lsquo;raaf 7:43]<\/i>, \r\n    and say as the Companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) used to say: By Allah, were it not for Allah, we would not have been \r\n    guided and we would not have given charity or prayed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For the one who used to follow a different religion, \r\n    believing in it and following its Prophet, then Allah, may He be exalted, \r\n    guided him to the light of Islam and he believed in the Seal of the \r\n    Prophets, the glad tidings from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) are sufficient for him:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari (3011) and Muslim (154) narrated from Abu Moosa \r\n    al-Ash&lsquo;ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;There are three who will be given a double reward: a man who \r\n    had a slave woman whom he taught and taught her well, then he set her free \r\n    and married her &ndash; he will have a double reward; a believer from among the \r\n    people of the Book who believed (in his Prophet), then he believed in the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and followed him and \r\n    believed in him&ndash; he will have a double reward; and a slave who fulfils his \r\n    duty towards Allaah and towards his master &ndash; he will have a double reward.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]11783[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatout]150930[\\fatout]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what has happened between you and your parents \r\n    of differences in culture and religion, this is the same thing that happens \r\n    among human beings. What has happened to them of divorce is something that \r\n    happens frequently, especially with repeated problems that create serious \r\n    friction between them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we advise you to do is to focus primarily on telling \r\n    them about the religion of Islam and calling them to it. If Allah blesses \r\n    you by guiding them, then there is the strong hope that they may be \r\n    reconciled, in sha Allah. If it is decreed that they should remain \r\n    separated, they will have gained the true religion and will be guaranteed \r\n    salvation from the punishment of Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In fact this is one of the greatest rights that they have \r\n    over you, that you should make them share this blessing that you enjoy, the \r\n    blessing of Islam and submission to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and \r\n    worshipping Him alone with no partner or associate. So do not spare any \r\n    effort in this matter, because it is an important mission, and you will see \r\n    its good effects, if Allah wills, in this world before the Hereafter. Seek \r\n    help in that by offering supplication (du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;) for them whilst striving to \r\n    take practical measures in support of that mission. You can also seek help \r\n    from experienced people in your city to achieve that. We ask Allah to guide \r\n    you and help you, and to accept your righteous deeds and guide your parents \r\n    to that which will bring happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9763","question_id":"9763","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We were very happy to receive this message and we praise \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, for having enabled you to be keen to follow your \r\n    religion, adhere to the commands of your Lord and be patient in putting up \r\n    with the harm you encounter because of that.

Her anger with you for obeying your Lord does not \r\n    matter, because obedience to Allah takes precedence over obedience to anyone \r\n    else. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is \r\n    no obedience to anyone if it involves sin; rather obedience is only in that \r\n    which is right and proper.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7257; Muslim, 1840. And \r\n    he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no obedience \r\n    to any created being if it involves disobedience towards Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, 1098&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you are not able to offer the prayers or follow any other \r\n    commands of your Lord or keep away from anything that Allah has forbidden \r\n    except by telling lies to your mother, there is no blame on you, in sha \r\n    Allah, for telling her lies, although it is better for you to employ double \r\n    entendres in your speech, i.e., tell her things that will make her feel \r\n    comfortable and spare you from her harm, whilst you intend a correct meaning \r\n    without drawing her attention to it. For example, if she asks you, &ldquo;Did you \r\n    pray?&rdquo; you can say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but what you intend in your heart is that you did \r\n    not pray Taraweeh, for example, or qiyaam al-layl, or you did not pray \r\n    anything except the fard (obligatory) prayer, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to wearing hijab, try to convince her that this \r\n    is the command of your Lord and that it is also your choice, and strive hard \r\n    to avoid her evil and harm as much as you can.

This will make it easier for you to pray when \r\n    you are with your mother, because the time needed to pray two rak&lsquo;ahs is \r\n    shorter than the time needed to pray four.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another concession granted to the traveller is that he may \r\n    put two prayers together, so he may pray Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr together at the same \r\n    time, praying Zuhr with two rak&lsquo;ahs, then praying &lsquo;Asr with two rak&lsquo;ahs. \r\n    That may be done at the time of the earlier prayer, i.e., offering the two \r\n    prayers at the time of Zuhr, before the usual time for &lsquo;Asr begins, or it \r\n    may be done at the time of the later prayer, so if the time for Zuhr has \r\n    begun and he did not pray, he may wait until the time for &lsquo;Asr begins, then \r\n    offer the two prayers together.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayers may be offered at the \r\n    time of the earlier or later prayer, but it should be noted that Maghrib \r\n    cannot be shortened when travelling; rather it should be offered with three \r\n    rak&lsquo;ahs as usual.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to Fajr, it should be offered with two rak&lsquo;ahs at \r\n    the proper time, when dawn has broken, until the sun rises.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This putting together of prayers will be helpful for you, \r\n    because you can choose the time when your mother is not paying any attention \r\n    to you, or she is busy with something, or you can give her the impression \r\n    that you have gone to the bathroom, and the like, or you can pray when you \r\n    stop for a break, far away from her, or after you reach your destination, if \r\n    you are going to arrive before the time for the second prayer ends, and so \r\n    on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answers to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]82658[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]105109[\\fatin],\r\n    [fatin]38079[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Finally, we advise you to remain steadfast in your obedience \r\n    to your Lord, and be keen to please Him; always remember your Lord and read \r\n    His Book, so that your mind and heart will be at rest and you will increase \r\n    in guidance.

It is clear that \r\n    she is as upset as we are to see that the one who is taking charge of \r\n    raising this Muslim girl is a Christian woman, who it is expected will turn \r\n    her away from her natural state and true religion and cause her to become a \r\n    Christian or to end up without any religion. Hence we advise the sister who \r\n    asked this question to pay a great deal of attention to two important \r\n    matters:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>After thanking this woman for \r\n    coming to her and asking about the best way to raise a Muslim girl, she \r\n    should try to get her to hand over custody of this Muslim girl to a Muslim \r\n    family or an Islamic centre. Even better than that would be to look for \r\n    Muslim relatives of this girl who are trustworthy in terms of their attitude \r\n    and religious commitment, who could look after her and gave her a home. You \r\n    have to be gentle and polite in doing this<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>If this woman does not agree to \r\n    give up looking after this child, then we advise you to stay in close \r\n    contact with her, to offer advice, care and education, so that this woman \r\n    will not be the sole person concerned with this girl&rsquo;s upbringing lest she \r\n    teaches her that which could lead to the corruption of her religious \r\n    commitment or behaviour. For example, this woman could make arrangements for \r\n    the girl to attend an Islamic school or spend time with a religiously \r\n    committed family or with a woman who has good knowledge of Islam and works \r\n    in da&lsquo;wah. If none of that is possible, then you should keep in touch with \r\n    this girl so that you can communicate with her, so that she can remain in \r\n    touch with her religion, her nature will not be spoiled and she will not \r\n    apostatise from her religion. And seek reward for all of that with Allah, \r\n    may He be exalted, and be patient in doing so, until Allah guides her \r\n    parents &ndash; or one of them &ndash; to take her back and raise her in the true \r\n    religion or the girl can go to a Muslim who can raise her such as a woman or \r\n    an institution or a righteous person among her relatives.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps your being close to that woman will be a cause of her \r\n    becoming Muslim, then she would be a suitable and trustworthy guardian to \r\n    take care of that girl.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is what we think you should do, and we encourage you to \r\n    do it. We ask Allah to guide you and help you to do that which pleases Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also &ldquo;How to raise a child&rdquo; in the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]10016[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9766","question_id":"9766","answers":"Praise be to Allah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    What appears to be the case based on the general meaning of \r\n    the shar&lsquo;i evidence concerning that is that calling people to Allah, may He \r\n    be exalted, is a communal obligation (fard kifaayah) upon the ummah and it \r\n    is an individual obligation (fard &lsquo;ayn) upon every Muslim, according to his \r\n    level of ability and knowledge.

So it \r\n    is a communal obligation; if sufficient numbers of people undertake it, the \r\n    duty is waived from the others and for the others da&lsquo;wah becomes a confirmed \r\n    Sunnah (Sunnah mu&rsquo;akkadah) and a great righteous deed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if the people of a specific area or region do not \r\n    undertake da&lsquo;wah, the burden of sin is incurred by all of them, and it \r\n    becomes obligatory for all of them; each person must undertake to call \r\n    people to Islam, according to his ability. However, generally speaking, with \r\n    regard to every country, what is required is for there to be a group that is \r\n    devoted to the mission of calling people to Allah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted, throughout the world, to convey the message of Allah and to explain \r\n    the command of Allah by all possible means, because the Messenger (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) sent out callers, and he sent letters to \r\n    people and to kings and rulers, calling them to Allah, may He be glorified \r\n    and exalted.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>Majmoo&lsquo; Fataawa Ibn Baaz<\/i>, 1\/330&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is no need at all for differences as to which work \r\n    should take precedence: calling Muslims or calling non-Muslims. The one whom \r\n    Allah enables to do any of that should go ahead with it. There are some \r\n    Muslims who are good at calling non-Muslims, because Allah has given them \r\n    the ability to explain things clearly or to convince people easily, or He \r\n    has enabled him to learn the language of the non-Muslims whom he is calling, \r\n    or because of the nature of his work, as there are many non-Muslims with \r\n    him, or because he travels to their country or because he has a neighbour \r\n    who is a non-Muslim, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In such cases we say to the individual: Go ahead and call \r\n    these people with wisdom and beautiful preaching, with clear proof, and with \r\n    patience in dealing with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]99976[\\fatin] for information on how \r\n    to call these people.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And there are some Muslims who are good at calling their \r\n    fellow Muslims, because of some of the things that have been mentioned \r\n    above; or because he does not have the patience to call non-Muslims; or \r\n    because he has skills in convincing and debating in various issues and \r\n    establishing clear proof; or because he is well versed in some branches of \r\n    Islamic knowledge that may be needed more by one who calls Muslims than one \r\n    who calls non-Muslims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point of all this is to say that there is no need for \r\n    disputes or arguments, let alone division, around this issue.

We do not know of any \r\n    one among the early daa&lsquo;iyahs (callers) who said: We are going to refrain \r\n    from calling the non-believers until we have set straight the Muslims&rsquo; \r\n    affairs.

Their efforts in calling people to Allaah (da&rsquo;wah) cannot be denied. But like many other groups they make some \r\n    mistakes, and some points should be noted concerning them. These points may be summed up as follows, noting that these mistakes may vary within \r\n    this group, depending on the environment and society in which they find themselves. In societies in which knowledge and scholars are prevalent and \r\n    the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah is widespread, the mistakes are much less; in other societies these mistakes may be greater. Some of \r\n    their mistakes are:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; Not adopting the &lsquo;aqeedah of Ahl \r\n    al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah.

For example they interpret the verses on jihad as referring to &ldquo;going out for da&rsquo;wah&rdquo;. The \r\n    verses which mentioned the word khurooj (going out) etc. are interpreted by them as meaning going out for da&rsquo;wah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; They make their system of going out for \r\n    da&rsquo;wah an act of worship. So they started to misquote the Qur&rsquo;aan to support their system which specifies certain numbers of days and months. This \r\n    system, which they think is based on evidence from Qur&rsquo;aan, is widespread among them in all countries and environments. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; They do some things that go against \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, such as appointing one of them to make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for them whilst the group goes out for da&rsquo;wah, and they think that their success or \r\n    failure depends on whether or not this man was sincere and his du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; accepted. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>6 &ndash; Da&rsquo;eef (weak) and mawdoo&rsquo; (fabricated) \r\n    ahaadeeth are widespread among them, and this is not befitting for those who aim to call people to Allaah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>7 &ndash; They do not speak of munkaraat (evil \r\n    things), thinking that enjoining what is good is sufficient.

Hoping that you will be \r\n          able to fulfil the purpose of your da&rsquo;wah trip and make the most of \r\n          your precious time with which you seek to earn reward from Allaah, we \r\n          offer you the following advice: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1 &ndash; Fear Allaah (taqwa) and be aware that He is watching \r\n          you in secret and in public. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Fear Allaah wherever \r\n          you may be&hellip;&rdquo; (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1910; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n          in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>, 1618). Fearing Allaah is the main thing, \r\n          and it is the means of being granted strength in this world and reward \r\n          in the Hereafter. And seek reward with Allaah and have sincerity of \r\n          intention towards Allaah in all that you say and do. &ldquo;Actions are but \r\n          by intentions and every man shall have but that which he intended.&rdquo; \r\n          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1; Muslim, 3530). These are things which will \r\n          help the daa&rsquo;iyah and make his actions blessed, just as fearing Allaah \r\n          is the main thing, and it is the means of being granted strength in \r\n          this world and reward in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; Be a good example in your words, appearance, eating \r\n          and sleeping. In all of that, follow the example of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his words and actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; Strive to lower your gaze, especially in countries \r\n          where display of women&rsquo;s charms is prevalent and there is no veiling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          4 &ndash; It is preferable to wear Arabic clothing because \r\n          that serves many interests. It is not preferable to wear European clothing. \r\n          With regard to what is said about the dangers of wearing Arabic clothing \r\n          abroad, these are merely rumours and have no basis in reality. One may \r\n          take off the headcover and wear only the cap if necessary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          5 &ndash; The siwaak is one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it is rare in most countries, \r\n          so it is a gift which will be appreciated by many Muslims.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          6 &ndash; Use your hand-luggage for clothes, because it is \r\n          possible that luggage may be lost in those countries.&nbsp; This also \r\n          frees up room in your suitcases for the books you will need. Change \r\n          your money into dollars so that you will have it available to spend \r\n          during your trip.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          7 &ndash; Take all the necessary precautions before travelling, \r\n          such as vaccinations against the diseases that are prevalent in the \r\n          countries to which you are travelling. Take the yellow international \r\n          vaccination card with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          8 &ndash; Take all the addresses that you will need with you, \r\n          such as the addresses of the embassies of some Arab and Muslim countries, \r\n          and the addresses of well known and trustworthy Islamic centers and \r\n          organizations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Beware of giving the impression to the Muslims with whom \r\n          you mix that you have come to offer them material help, because this \r\n          opens the door to requests for help and personal demands. Indeed, some \r\n          people may think that you have a lot of money with you and will lie \r\n          in wait to do you harm. But this does not mean that you cannot take \r\n          some zakaah and charity with you, to give to needy people once you are \r\n          sure of their need, but this must be done with caution and secretly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          9 &ndash; Do not indulge in unnecessary talk, and beware of \r\n          referring to matters of marriage, even in a joking manner, especially \r\n          with interpreters. There have been unfortunate cases where some daa&rsquo;iyahs \r\n          got married at the beginning of their trips and got divorced at the \r\n          end, which has led to tarnishing of the reputation of the daa&rsquo;iayahs \r\n          and neglect of children and wives.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          10 &ndash; Equip yourself with the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>A pocket-sized copy of \r\n          the Qur&rsquo;aan, preferably with a translation of the meanings and footnotes \r\n          describing the reasons for revelation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>A book or two about 'aqeedah (beliefs, doctrines), especially Tawheed (Divine Oneness) and refutation of misguided groups such as the Sufi tareeqahs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>One or two books on the \r\n          fiqh of worship, especially the fiqh of tahaarah (purity), prayer and \r\n          fasting.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span><i>Riyaadh al-Saaliheen<\/i><\/span> \r\n          by Imam al-Nawawi, which is a comprehensive resource, especially which \r\n          regard to the fiqh of tahaarah and fasting.<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span><i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i><\/span> \r\n          (fatwas of the Standing Committee)<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>A selection of lessons \r\n          and lectures recorded on tapes, so that one may make use of them especially \r\n          during long car journeys.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>Keep with you a compass \r\n          for determining the direction of the Qiblah and an alarm clock.

Avoid indulging in controversial \r\n          issues or stereotyping people, and try to explain the truth without \r\n          criticizing individuals. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          13 &ndash; Wisdom is one of the most important basics in calling \r\n          people to Allaah, especially when travelling. It is essential when prioritizing \r\n          and outlining the steps to be taken to achieve one&rsquo;s goals, and it is \r\n          also required when dealing with different types of people. It is wise \r\n          to show due respect to people according to their status and to acknowledge \r\n          their positions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          14 &ndash; The daa&rsquo;iyah will find that some questions of fiqh \r\n          are posed to him during his trip, especially after giving lessons and \r\n          talks. He should be deal with this matter in a proper way, replying \r\n          to questions with evidence and quoting the words of the scholars, or \r\n          else saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. It was said that &ldquo;the one who says &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t \r\n          know&rsquo; has issued a fatwa (answered the question).&rdquo; There is nothing \r\n          to stop you delaying giving an answer until you have had time to review \r\n          the matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          15 &ndash; It is better for the members of the group to take \r\n          turns in giving lessons and talks. We do not think that only one person \r\n          should take all the responsibility so that he becomes the mufti and \r\n          khateeb and preacher, even if he is more capable, because one of the \r\n          aims of these trips is to offer practical da&rsquo;wah training to the daa&rsquo;iyahs. \r\n          These trips offer a valuable opportunity for training in preaching and \r\n          giving khutbahs, especially for brothers who find it difficult to do \r\n          that in their home country because there are so many scholars and seekers \r\n          of knowledge there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          16 &ndash; Getting to know about the situation of the Muslims, \r\n          by finding out about the Islamic situation in general and the situation \r\n          of local Islamic organizations and institutions, both official and non-official, \r\n          in particular; writing down their addresses and reports on their activities; \r\n          finding out about prominent and influential Muslim personalities in \r\n          the society; attempting to win them over by visiting them and speaking \r\n          to them nicely, so as to advance the cause of Islam and the Muslims. \r\n          All of this must be done within the guidelines of sharee&rsquo;ah.

So women have \r\nto call people to Allaah and enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, \r\nfollowing the guidelines of sharee&rsquo;ah, just as men are required to do. A woman \r\nshould not be deterred from calling people to Allaah by feelings of anxiety or \r\nlack of patience because of some people looking down on her, insulting her or \r\nmocking her. Rather she has to put up with that and be patient. If she thinks \r\nthat people are mocking her or making fun of her in some way, then she should \r\npay attention to something else, which is that she should be the best example of \r\nobserving hijaab in front of non-mahram men and avoiding mixing freely.

But this confusion can be dispelled by dealing with this mistaken notion.&nbsp; So the earth was created \r\n    in two days, and the mountains were created and the sustenance measured in two more days which makes a total of four, i.e., this took the other \r\n    two days. Then the creation of the seven heavens took two days. So the total is six days of the Days of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The mufassireen commented on this fact which \r\n    deals with the mistaken notion. Al-Qurtubi said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&ldquo;<i>in four days<\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; this is like someone \r\n    saying, &ldquo;I set out from Basra to Baghdad in ten days and to Kufa in fifteen days, i.e., a total time of fifteen days.&rdquo; (<i>al-Jaami&rsquo; li Ahkaam \r\n    al-Qur&rsquo;aan<\/i>, vol. 15, p. 343).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Baghawi said: &ldquo;<i>in four days<\/i>&rdquo; means \r\n    the creation of what is in the earth. The measuring of the sustenance was on Tuesday and Wednesday, which along with Sunday and Monday add up to \r\n    four days. This is like saying &ldquo;I married a woman yesterday and today I married two&rdquo; &ndash; one of whom is the woman whom he married the day before.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tafseer al-Baghawi<\/i>, \r\n    7\/165&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Zajjaaj said: &ldquo;<i>in four days<\/i>&rdquo; means \r\n    two days added to the previous two days.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Kashshaaf<\/i>, \r\n    vol. 3, p. 444&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>These verses &ndash; from <i>Soorah Fussilat<\/i> &ndash; \r\n    confirm the other verse, which says that the creation of the heavens and the earth was completed in six days.

The \r\n          youth are obliged to fear Allaah and to adhere to the truth, not to \r\n          go to extremes or be harsh. It may so happen that some of the youth \r\n          are ignorant, so they go to extremes in some matters, or they are lacking \r\n          in knowledge, so they are negligent in some other matters. But all the \r\n          youth and others, such as the scholars, must fear Allaah and seek the \r\n          truth with evidence (daleel), i.e., what Allaah and His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said; they must beware of \r\n          bid&rsquo;ah (reprehensible innovations) and exaggeration. They must also \r\n          beware of ignorance and shortcomings. No one among them is infallible, \r\n          and some of the people may err by doing too much or by falling short. \r\n          But that does not mean that everyone is at fault; the fault rests with \r\n          those who make the mistake.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;But the enemies of Allaah among the Christians and \r\n          others who are following in their wake have made this a means of attacking \r\n          the da&rsquo;wah and putting an end to it, by accusing its people of being \r\n          extremists and fundamentalists.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;What does &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo; mean?<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;If they are fundamentalists in the sense that they \r\n          adhere to the fundamentals or basic principles (usool), to what Allaah \r\n          and His Messenger said, then this is praise,&nbsp; not condemnation. \r\n          Adhering to the fundamentals, the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His \r\n          Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n          Allaah be upon him), is commendable and cannot be condemned. What is \r\n          to be condemned is when people overdo things or fall short, when they \r\n          go to extremes or are harsh or do not do what they have to do &ndash; this \r\n          is what is to be condemned. But the person who adheres to the right \r\n          principles, derived from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him), is not at fault; this is perfect and is to be praised. \r\n          This is what is obligatory upon seekers of knowledge and those who call \r\n          others to Allaah: they should adhere to the fundamentals from the Book \r\n          of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and whatever they know \r\n          of the basic principles of fiqh, &lsquo;aqeedah and hadeeth, whatever can \r\n          be used as evidence (daleel). They have to have basic principles which \r\n          they follow. Describing the daayi&rsquo;ahs as fundamentalists is a general \r\n          word which does not mean anything apart from condemning them and putting \r\n          people off. Fundamentalism is not a bad thing, in fact it is something \r\n          good.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;If the seeker of knowledge adheres to the fundamentals, \r\n          paying attention to them and staying up at night to study them from \r\n          the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and what the scholars have \r\n          stated, there is nothing wrong with that. But going to extremes in following \r\n          bid&rsquo;ah is what is wrong, and going to extremes of ignorance and falling \r\n          short is also wrong.<\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big>&nbsp;The daa&rsquo;iyahs are obliged to adhere to the fundamentals \r\n          of sharee&rsquo;ah and adhere to the middle course to which Allaah has guided \r\n          them, for Allaah has made them an ummah justly balanced (cf. Al-Baqarah \r\n          2:143). So the daa&rsquo;iyahs have to be justly balanced, treading a middle \r\n          course between exaggeration and negligence. They have to be steadfast \r\n          in adhering to the truth, and to adhere to it on the basis of shar&rsquo;i \r\n          evidence (daleel).

For you are doing a great act of \r\n    worship which is the mission of the Prophets and Messengers and those who \r\n    follow in their footsteps.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; You can serve Islam by shunning laziness, weakness and \r\n    apathy, for this religion is the religion of resolve, ambition and courage, \r\n    and its call is only harmed by laziness or reckless ignorance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; You can serve Islam by connecting your heart to Allaah \r\n    and reciting a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and prayers for forgiveness, and persisting in \r\n    reading Qur&rsquo;aan. There is nothing that is more effective in cleansing the \r\n    heart and refreshing the soul, and making it active and energetic so that it \r\n    will not get tired or bored, than remembering Allaah much and drawing nearer \r\n    to Him by means of obeying Him and doing naafil (supererogatory) acts of \r\n    worship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; You can serve Islam by forming bonds with scholars who \r\n    practise what they preach, those who are known to be sincere and who are \r\n    well established in jihad and supporting this religion. Marching under their \r\n    banner and following their lead is very good and beneficial.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    9 &ndash; You can serve Islam by organizing your time on a daily, \r\n    weekly and monthly basis. There are actions which should be done every day, \r\n    others which should be done every week, and others which should be done \r\n    every month or every year.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example, you should make da&rsquo;wah to those whom you see \r\n    every day and to those whom you see once a week. You may have a family \r\n    gathering once a month, and there may be annual conferences, or journeys for \r\n    Hajj or &lsquo;Umrah once a year, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    10 &ndash; You can serve Islam by paying it some attention and \r\n    giving it some of your time, thoughts and money, and making it your main \r\n    concern. So when you stand up, it is for Islam; when you walk, it is for \r\n    Islam; when you think, it is for Islam; when you give, it is for Islam; when \r\n    you sit, it is for Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    11 &ndash; you can serve Islam by hastening to contribute every \r\n    time you find an opportunity to do good. Do not hesitate or delay or put it \r\n    off.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: From Kayfa akhdim al-Islam by &lsquo;Abd al-Malik al-Qaasim, p. 18."},{"id":"9786","question_id":"9786","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>The Tableeghi Jama&rsquo;at (Jamaa&rsquo;at al-Tableegh) is one of the da&rsquo;wah groups that is \r\n    striving to spread Islam and call people to it.

This is something \r\n    that would lead to chaos and open the door to any fool who wants to \r\n    attribute such letters to whomever he wants. Thus the da&rsquo;wah would turn into \r\n    a fiction-writing competition and exhortations would turn into a contest to \r\n    choose a figure to whom to attribute words.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; We are certain that the author is not a scholar or a \r\n    seeker of knowledge. We have only seen this letter in chatrooms that are \r\n    frequented by ordinary people. One of the conditions of calling people to \r\n    Allaah is that the speaker should have knowledge of what he is saying, \r\n    because he is speaking on behalf of the Lord of the Worlds and speaking in \r\n    the name of Islam, so this is not the field for those with colourful \r\n    imaginations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; This letter does not contain any verse or hadeeth, so it \r\n    distracts people from exhortation that is based on the Qur&rsquo;aan. It is as if \r\n    there is nothing in Islam that could move people such as clear verses, \r\n    saheeh ahaadeeth or clear shar&rsquo;i rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; This letter contains a kind of respect towards the \r\n    Shaytaan, as if he is the speaker and the people are listening to him, and \r\n    transmitting messages that are signed by him. Undoubtedly this is a kind of \r\n    honour to the one who has been cursed and who is too despicable to have his \r\n    messages conveyed by Muslims in their chatrooms and on their mobile phones. \r\n    Any daa&rsquo;iyah or seeker of knowledge could write an essay explaining how the \r\n    Shaytaan deals with sinners and with worshippers, comparing and contrasting \r\n    the two, and explaining that with verses and ahaadeeth, without making the \r\n    speaker the Shaytaan himself. Thus he could reach the same goal as that for \r\n    which this letter was written.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; This letter contains ignorance of Islamic rulings and \r\n    lies about Islam, such as when it says, &ldquo;Did I not warn you that whoever \r\n    among them lives to see Laylat al-Qadr, his past and future sins will be \r\n    forgiven?&rdquo; This sentence reveals ignorance on two counts. Firstly, it is \r\n    well known that merely living until Laylat al-Qadr comes brings no virtue. \r\n    The saheeh hadeeth states that virtue is found in spending Laylat al-Qadr in \r\n    prayer, not just living to see it. Secondly, the virtue attained by the one \r\n    who spends Laylat al-Qadr in prayer is that his previous sins are forgiven, \r\n    not his future sins. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever spends the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of \r\n    faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1802). The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) did not mention future sins.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; This letter says that all the devils among the jinn are \r\n    chained up, but it seems that the ones who are chained up are the strong \r\n    ones (maarid), as it says in some saheeh reports. We have discussed this in \r\n    the answer to several questions, such as \r\n    [fatin]39736[\\fatin], \r\n    [fatin]12653 [\\fatin]and \r\n    [fatin]14253[\\fatin]. In some of \r\n    those answers it states that the fact that those strong jinn are chained up \r\n    does not mean that they cannot whisper (waswaas), which proves that this \r\n    letter is completely baseless.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Conclusion:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We do not think that it is permissible to spread this letter, \r\n    because it goes against sharee&rsquo;ah and because it is silly and foolish. We \r\n    think that such means distract people from the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and that \r\n    their supposed benefits are limited to style only, and do not include the \r\n    meaning and content.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9788","question_id":"9788","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      The one who thinks that Islam does not approve of technical \r\n      development and modern inventions is mistaken.

He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace and \r\n    Allah be upon him) say: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s lengthening his prayer and shortening his \r\n    khutbah is a sign of his understanding (of religion), so make your prayers \r\n    lengthy and your khutbahs brief, for there is charm in eloquent speech.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Muslim, 869.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]122701[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The projector may be visible to some people and not others, \r\n    and some of the worshippers may be deprived, such as the women and those who \r\n    are sitting in a place where they cannot see the projector which, in this \r\n    case, will be part of the khutbah and complementary to the words of the \r\n    khateeb.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In order to use this equipment, the lights have to be turned \r\n    off and the lights of the projector have to be turned on. This will require \r\n    some of the worshippers present to move, either to turn the lights off or \r\n    turn the projector on, and they will be distracted by the operation of the \r\n    projector or sounds coming from the machine, which is contrary to the \r\n    rulings on Jumu&lsquo;ah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    forbade touching the pebbles during the khutbah and ruled that the one who \r\n    does that deliberately will be deprived of the reward for Jumu&lsquo;ah. In fact \r\n    he forbade playing with the pebbles which were usually on the ground in the \r\n    mosque: &ldquo;whoever touches the pebbles has engaged in an idle action.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by Muslim (857) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we think is that it is not permissible to use a \r\n    projector during the Jumu&lsquo;ah khutbah.

Have you tried expressing how much the \r\n    smoking bothers you and the bad effect it has on you, in a calm and polite manner?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Most smokers, if you ask them to stop in a calm manner, explaining the reason, \r\n    will respond immediately.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Conversely, they will respond to those who advise them in a bad way in an even \r\n    worse manner, with few exceptions. If a person wants to achieve his goal, he has to be patient, careful and speak well. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You ask &ldquo;do I have to control myself&rdquo;? Definitely the answer will be yes, you have \r\n    to have control yourself with these and with other people. How many things there are in this world that provoke anger.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Controlling yourself and your feelings must be one of your priorities. Our noble and merciful \r\n    Prophet taught us this. When that man came to him and said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, advise me,&rdquo; the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said, &ldquo;Do not become angry.&rdquo; The man repeated his question several times and the Messenger said, &ldquo;Do not become angry.&rdquo; (Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari, 6116).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>How can a person live if he does not equip himself with patience?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Try to control your nerves by all possible means. Try to select friends who will \r\n    help you to control yourself and become patient.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Keep away from any friends and colleagues who annoy you and get on your nerves. \r\n    Try as much as possible to avoid the situations that provoke your anger.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>First and last, seek help through du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and asking Allaah to help you to be \r\n    patient in all situations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Do not say that you cannot control your nerves, for feeling that you will fail may \r\n    lead to it becoming a reality which you give in to and accept. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If you are determined and have a sincere intention, then in sha Allah you will \r\n    reach your goal. But you should note that you will find that difficult [in the beginning]. But have confidence that you will eventually gain \r\n    control of yourself and this bitterness and struggle will become sweet on the day when you find it bears fruit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9794","question_id":"9794","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<o>\r\n    <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>This is permissible if it is done in order to advice the person and rebuke him so that he will be deterred from committing sin.

Al-Qaadi said: What this means is that goals may be \r\n    achieved by means of kindness that cannot be achieved by anything else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to uttering words such as kaafir (disbeliever), \r\n    faasiq (immoral person), murtadd (apostate), etc, this may be a cause of the \r\n    person being put off and persisting in his sin, and not accepting the \r\n    truth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz said in his commentary on the hadeeth of Abu Dharr \r\n    mentioned above:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This shows that if a person says to another, &quot;You are a \r\n    faasiq (immoral person)&quot; or &quot;You are a kaafir&quot;, and that is not the case, \r\n    then he is the one who deserves to be described in that manner. If the \r\n    person is as described, it does not necessarily mean that the one who called \r\n    him that is free of sin. If the intention is to advise him or someone else \r\n    by referring to his situation, it is permissible, but if the intention is to \r\n    expose and shame him, and and to hurt him, then it is not permissible, \r\n    because we are commanded to conceal people's faults and teach then and \r\n    advise then in a manner that is better. As far as a person is able to \r\n    achieve that in a kind manner, it is not permissible for him to do it in a \r\n    harsh manner, because that may make him stubborn and cause him to persist in \r\n    that action, as is the nature of many people. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Going with a girl who is unveiled and wears makeup is not \r\n    kufr, rather it is a sin because it is one of the means that lead to immoral \r\n    actions. But he should advise this person who has gone with a girl who is \r\n    unveiled and wears makeup, so that Allaah may guide him thereby.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<br \/><br \/>Source: Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa'imah, 17\/66."},{"id":"9799","question_id":"9799","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is \r\n    obligatory upon you at all times, whether your father is there with you or \r\n    he is absent from the home.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, describing who is obliged \r\n    to forbid evil: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, enjoining what is \r\n    good and forbidding what is evil is a communal obligation; if some people do \r\n    it, the rest are absolved of blame, but if all of them fail to do it, then \r\n    each one who was able to do it but did not, with no excuse or fear, is \r\n    guilty of sin. And it may become an individual obligation, such as if a \r\n    person is in a place where no one knows of it but him, or if no one is able \r\n    to remove it but him, such as one who sees his wife, child or slave \r\n    committing an evil action or falling short in a good action. The scholars \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with them) said: Enjoining what is good and \r\n    forbidding what is evil is not waived in the case of one who is accountable \r\n    because he thinks that it will do no good; rather he must do it for the \r\n    reminder will benefit the believers. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So denouncing evil is not \r\n    limited to a certain number of times; rather the one who sees an evil action \r\n    and is able to denounce it must do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But the scholars differed \r\n    concerning the issue of denouncing evil in the case where one thinks that \r\n    denouncing it will not deter the person from doing it. Some of them were of \r\n    the view that denouncing him is obligatory so as to discharge his duty \r\n    towards Allaah and in the hope that the one who is addressed may benefit \r\n    from the exhortation. This is the apparent meaning of the words of al-Nawawi \r\n    quoted above. And some of them were of the view that it is not obligatory \r\n    but it is mustahabb (recommended) in that case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-&lsquo;Allaamah al-Safaareeni \r\n    al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>Ghidha&rsquo; al-Albaab fi \r\n    Sharh Manzoomat al-Adaab<\/i> (1\/215): al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab said in his \r\n    commentary on <i>al-Arba&rsquo;een al-Nawawiyyah<\/i>: al-Qaadi Abu Ya&rsquo;la narrated \r\n    two reports from Imam Ahmad concerning the issue of whether it is obligatory \r\n    to denounce an evil action when one knows that the person will not accept \r\n    that, and he regarded as correct the views that it is obligatory. This is \r\n    also the view of most scholars. One of the salaf was asked about this and he \r\n    said: This will be discharging his duty towards Allaah. End quote. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thus it is clear that if \r\n    you are able to forbid this evil action, without that leading to a greater \r\n    evil, such as if the one whom you denounce will become stubborn and will \r\n    clearly state that he regarded something haraam as being permissible, or he \r\n    will say bad things about sharee&rsquo;ah and its rulings, and other such evils \r\n    which may result from denouncing the evil action, especially if the person \r\n    who does it is harsh, or he embarrasses him in front of others &ndash; if you are \r\n    able to do it, then it is obligatory for you to denounce this evil action \r\n    even if you think that they will never stop it, but you should deal as \r\n    kindly as possible with the one whom you are rebuking, in the hope that this \r\n    may cause him to accept the advice.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As to whether you should \r\n    denounce this evil publicly or privately, the basic principle is that the \r\n    one who does the evil action openly should be denounced publicly, but if \r\n    someone does it secretly, it is not permissible to rebuke him publicly. \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i> (3\/434): If a man commits evil actions openly, he \r\n    must be rebuked openly, and speaking about him in his absence is no longer \r\n    haraam. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But in fact the issue of \r\n    whether it should be done publicly or privately depends on the interest \r\n    which one hopes to achieve thereby. If one thinks it most likely that the \r\n    person will benefit from being advised privately, and that he will become \r\n    stubborn if it is done publicly, then you must advise him privately and deal \r\n    with him gently. Each case must be dealt with on its own merits.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Finally, we would like to \r\n    remind you of the reward of Allaah for the one who takes on the mission of \r\n    calling people to goodness and reminds them of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah, His angels, and the \r\n    inhabitants of heaven and earth, even the ant in its hole and even the fish, \r\n    send blessings &ndash; i.e., pray for good &ndash; upon the one who teaches the people \r\n    good.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2609) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\r\n    <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i> hadeeth no 1839.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>May Allaah help us all to \r\n    do that which He loves and which pleases Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9802","question_id":"9802","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to increase your energy and guide your efforts, \r\n    and grant you the best of rewards for your interest in da&rsquo;wah and calling \r\n    people to the religion and way of Allaah.

Thus they have a shared purpose and aim and become one party \r\n    which follows the path of Ahl al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah, who are the party of \r\n    Allaah and the supporters and promoters of His religion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible to follow blindly any group or party in \r\n    matters in which it goes against sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i> \r\n    (7\/177, 178).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a Muslim is living in a secular, kaafir state, and there \r\n    is a party that is calling for Islam, or playing a role in establishing the \r\n    religion among the Muslims, and is striving to protect their identity and \r\n    beliefs, then it is not permissible for anyone to abandon it, rather it \r\n    should be supported and helped as much as possible. If a Muslim cannot \r\n    support it except by joining it, there is no reason why he should not do so, \r\n    but it is essential to pay attention to what we have said about not being \r\n    partisan or following blindly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Sa&rsquo;di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his \r\n    discussion of what we learn from the story of Shu&rsquo;ayb in Soorat Hood (peace \r\n    be upon them both):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; Allaah may defend the believers in many ways, some of which \r\n    they may know and some they may not know at all. He may defend them by means \r\n    of their tribe or their kaafir compatriots, as Allaah defended Shu&rsquo;ayb from \r\n    the stoning of his people by means of his clan. There is nothing wrong with \r\n    striving to maintain these connections by means of which Islam and the \r\n    Muslims may be defended, and in some cases that may be essential, because \r\n    da&rsquo;wah is required according to ability. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, if the Muslims help those who are under the \r\n    rule of the kuffaar, and strive to make the state a republic in which the \r\n    religious and worldly rights of individuals and peoples are protected, that \r\n    is better than their submitting to a state that denies their religious and \r\n    worldly rights, and is keen to destroy them and make them its servants. Yes, \r\n    if it is possible to make the state an Islamic one where the Muslims are the \r\n    rulers, that is what should be done, but when that is not possible then the \r\n    next priority is supporting a type of state where religious and worldly \r\n    interests are protected.

Similarly, the caliph &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) burned a village in which alcohol was sold, as was \r\n    narrated by Abu &lsquo;Ubaydah and others, because the place where it is sold is \r\n    like the vessels in which it is sold.

The remedy will be by \r\n    using means to warn and protect people, by blocking the evil sites in the \r\n    Muslim countries, and developing programs to block them, and spreading \r\n    awareness and warning people. These efforts can only be undertaken by \r\n    nations and institutions, not by individuals who could fall victim to their \r\n    emotions and desire for change, and inadvertently fall prey to these corrupt \r\n    sites.

No one should claim to be \r\n    infallible. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    told us that the shaytaan flows through the son of Adam like blood, and Imam \r\n    Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: How often has a glance brought \r\n    doom to a person.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one whom Allaah has put \r\n    into any position of authority in a Muslim country must be sincere towards \r\n    the Muslims and keep evil and its people away from them, and keep them away \r\n    from everything that may harm their religious and worldly interests. That \r\n    includes preventing these corrupt magazines from being published and \r\n    distributed, and keeping their evil away from them.

So he should understand \r\n    before he enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil; being gentle when \r\n    enjoining is most likely to achieve the desired outcomes; and forbearance \r\n    after enjoining will enable him to be patient in bearing the reaction of the \r\n    one whom he enjoins or forbids, because the reaction will often be offensive \r\n    and rude.

When a Muslims hears or sees an evil that he is \r\n    able to denounce, he should do so, but he does not have to do that with \r\n    regard to every evil he sees or hears. Undoubtedly evil things vary in their \r\n    severity. And some of them involve transgression against other people whilst \r\n    others affect only the person who does them. In cases where the evil is \r\n    particularly serious or offensive, denouncing them is a more urgent duty for \r\n    the Muslims than evils that are less serious.

It is not permissible \r\n    to denounce them or the one who follows them, but there is nothing wrong \r\n    with debating them and explaining the correct point of view, as each scholar \r\n    see it. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for slandering the person himself and warning others \r\n    against him, that varies according to the person and the extent of the error \r\n    into which he has fallen, and the extent to which the Muslims benefit from \r\n    his da&rsquo;wah. If the man is calling people to a way other than the way of Ahl \r\n    al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah and is fighting the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, and \r\n    praising other ways, or his way is based on innovated principles, even if he \r\n    does not clearly declare that, then if there is some goodness in his message \r\n    but the evil outweighs the goodness, he must be warned against lest the \r\n    people be deceived by his words and he cause them to go astray.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are some people &ndash; daa&rsquo;iyahs &ndash; who claim to belong to \r\n    Ahl al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah, and do not promote any other way, but they have \r\n    so many wrong and weird ideas that the bad effects of their call outweigh \r\n    the good, and they are wrong more than they are right. These too must be \r\n    warned against.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is a third category of people who belong to Ahl \r\n    al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah, and who make some mistakes &ndash; which no human being \r\n    can avoid &ndash; due to either misinterpretation or incorrect ijtihaad or weak \r\n    knowledge or on the basis of what he believes is in the public interest of \r\n    the Muslims and so on &ndash; but in general they adhere to the Sunnah, promote it \r\n    and defend it, and their good aspects outweigh the bad, and the benefit that \r\n    people get from their da&rsquo;wah is greater than the harm that befalls some from \r\n    following these mistakes. In this case we must point out the mistakes so as \r\n    to warn people and advise them, and denounce evil, but it is not permissible \r\n    to overstep the mark and slander the people themselves, or try to bring \r\n    about their downfall and warn people against listening to them or learning \r\n    from them, or accuse them of errors that they have not actually uttered. The \r\n    fair-minded person can overlook a small slip if a person is mostly correct; \r\n    what human being is ever right all the time and never makes a mistake? &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <b>We will focus here on some important principles which we \r\n    must observe when looking at and judging others.<\/b>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <b>1 &ndash; The first principle: the basis of his knowledge and \r\n    actions.<\/b> If a person is seeking to follow the \r\n    Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and venerate his \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah, inwardly and outwardly, then he may be forgiven, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said, discussing Abu Dharr al-Harawi, al-Baaqillaani, al-Baaji and other \r\n    Ash&rsquo;ari scholars:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover they all strove hard in the way of Islam and did \r\n    good deeds, and refuted many of the proponents of heresy and innovation, and \r\n    supported many of the Ahl al-Sunnah, as is obvious to anyone who knows \r\n    anything about them, and who speaks of them with knowledge, sincerity, \r\n    justice and fairness. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But because they were confused about this principle that was \r\n    originally taken from the Mu&rsquo;tazilah [i.e., denying that deeds are done by \r\n    choice], although they are good and wise, they needed to refute it, so (by \r\n    way of refuting it) they may have said statements that Muslims of knowledge \r\n    and religious commitment found unacceptable. Because of that, people took \r\n    two approaches: some began to venerate them for their good qualities and \r\n    virtues, and some criticized them because of the innovation and falsehood in \r\n    some what they said, but the best of ways is the middle way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This does not apply only to these people, rather similar \r\n    things happened to many people of knowledge and religious commitment.

These come under \r\n    the heading of <i>&lsquo;ilm al-kalaam<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Theology, which is discussion of the essence and \r\n    attributes of Allaah, which also comes under the heading of <i>&lsquo;ilm \r\n    al-kalaam<\/i>. The philosophers did not have any other kind of knowledge \r\n    that was unique to them, rather they had some views and ideas which were \r\n    unique to them, some of which constitute kufr and some bid&rsquo;ah (innovation).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Natural sciences, some of which go against sharee&rsquo;ah, \r\n    Islam and truth, so it is ignorance, not knowledge that may be mentioned \r\n    alongside the other branches of knowledge. Some of it involves the \r\n    discussion of the attributes of different elements and how one can be \r\n    changed to another. This is similar to the way in which doctors examine the \r\n    human body in particular, from the point of view of what makes it sick and \r\n    what makes it healthy. They look at all the elements to see how they change \r\n    and move. But medicine has an edge over the physical body in that it is \r\n    needed, but there is no need for the study of nature.

The word philosopher is derived from \r\n    philosophy and means the lover of wisdom. But the meaning changed and came \r\n    to mean wisdom.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then the philosopher came to be called a wise man (hakeem). \r\n    In the past the word philosophy referred to study of the basic principles, \r\n    viewing knowledge as something based on rationality, the goal of which was \r\n    the search for truth. For its supporters, philosophy is, as Dr. Tawfeeq \r\n    al-Taweel described it: Rational examination, free from any restrictions and \r\n    authority imposed on it from outside, and with the ability to go all the way \r\n    on the basis of logic, propagating his view regardless of the difference \r\n    between these (philosophical) views and what is customarily known, religious \r\n    beliefs and the dictates of tradition, without being confronted or resisted \r\n    or punished by any authority. In Aristotle&rsquo;s view, the philosopher is of a \r\n    higher status than a prophet, because the prophet understands things by \r\n    means of imagination whereas the philosopher understands things by means of \r\n    reason and contemplation. In their view, imagination is of a lower status \r\n    than contemplation. Al-Faraabi agreed with Aristotle in viewing the \r\n    philosopher as being of higher status than a prophet.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In this sense philosophy is opposed to wisdom, which in \r\n    Islamic terminology refers to the Sunnah as defined by the majority of \r\n    muhadditheen and fuqaha&rsquo;, and in the sense of judgement, knowledge and \r\n    proficiency, alongside moral guidelines which control the whims and desires \r\n    of the self and keep it from doing haraam things. The wise man is the one \r\n    who has these characteristics, hence philosophy, as defined by the \r\n    philosophers, is one of the most dangerous falsehoods and most vicious in \r\n    fighting faith and religion on the basis of logic, which it is very easy to \r\n    use to confuse people in the name of reason, interpretation and metaphor \r\n    that distort the religious texts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam al-Shaafa&rsquo;i said: The people did not become ignorant and \r\n    begin to differ until they abandoned Arabic terminology and adopted the \r\n    terminology of Aristotle. Even though philosophy existed in the ancient \r\n    civilizations of Egypt, India and Persia, it became most famous in Greece \r\n    and became synonymous with that land, the reason being that the Greek \r\n    philosophers were interested in transmitting it from the legacy of \r\n    idolatrous peoples and the remnants of the divinely-revealed religions, \r\n    benefiting from the scriptures of Ibraaheem and Moosa (peace be upon them) \r\n    after the Greek victory over the Hebrews after the captivity in Babylon, and \r\n    benefiting from the religion of Luqmaan the Wise. So there was a mixture of \r\n    views that confirmed the divinity and Lordship of the Creator that was \r\n    contaminated with idolatry. Therefore the Greek philosophy was in some ways \r\n    a revival more than an innovation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Abi&rsquo;l-&lsquo;Izz, the commentator on <i>al-Tahhaawiyyah<\/i>, \r\n    summed up the schools of philosophical thought about the five basic \r\n    principles of religion in their view, as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That God does exist but He has no reality or essence, and He \r\n    does not know the details of His creation, but He does know about its \r\n    general terms, thus they denied that He creates the deeds of His slaves. \r\n    They also did not believe in His Books, as in their view God does not speak \r\n    or talk, and the Qur&rsquo;aan is just something that shines from active reasons \r\n    into purified human hearts. Exalted be Allaah far above what they ascribe to \r\n    Him.&nbsp; There is no separate entity that ascends or descends, rather in their \r\n    view it is all ideas in the mind that do not exist in reality.&nbsp; The \r\n    philosophers are the one who most deny the Last Day and its events. In their \r\n    view Paradise and Hell are no more than parables for the masses to \r\n    understand, but they have no reality beyond people&rsquo;s minds. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Greek philosophers still have an impact on all western \r\n    philosophies and ideologies, ancient and modern. Indeed, most of the Islamic \r\n    kalaami groups were influenced by them. The terminology of Islamic \r\n    philosophy did not emerge as a branch of knowledge that is taught in the \r\n    curriculum of Islamic studies until it was introduced by Shaykh Mustafa &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-Razzaaq &ndash; the Shaykh of al-Azhar &ndash; as a reaction to western attacks on \r\n    Islam based on the idea that Islam has no philosophy. But the fact of the \r\n    matter is that philosophy is an alien entity in the body of Islam. There is \r\n    no philosophy in Islam and there are no philosophers among Muslims in this \r\n    deviant sense. Rather in Islam there is certain knowledge and prominent \r\n    scholars who examine matters. Among the most famous philosophers who were \r\n    nominally Muslims were al-Kindi, al-Faraabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn \r\n    Rushd (Averroes). End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The majority of fuqaha&rsquo; have stated that it is haraam to \r\n    study philosophy. Among their comments on that are the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Ibn Nujaym (Hanafi) said in <i>al-Ashbaah wa&rsquo;l-Nazaa&rsquo;im<\/i>: \r\n    Acquiring knowledge may be an individual obligation, which is as much as one \r\n    needs for religious commitment to be sound; or it may be a communal \r\n    obligation, which is in addition to the previous and is done for the benefit \r\n    of others; or it may be recommended, which is studying fiqh and &lsquo;ilm al-qalb \r\n    (purification of the heart) in depth; or it may be haraam, which is learning \r\n    philosophy, magic (sleight of hand), astrology, geomancy, natural science \r\n    and witchcraft. End quote from <i>al-Ashbaah wa&rsquo;l-Nazaa&rsquo;ir ma&rsquo;a Sharhiha: \r\n    Ghamaz &lsquo;Ayoon al-Basaa&rsquo;ir<\/i> by al-Hamawi (4\/125).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; al-Dardeer (Maaliki) said in <i>al-Sharh al-Kabeer<\/i>, \r\n    discussing the kind of knowledge which is a communal obligation: Such as \r\n    studying sharee&rsquo;ah, which is not an individual obligation, and which \r\n    includes fiqh, tafseer, hadeeth and &lsquo;aqeedah, and things that help with that \r\n    such as (Arabic) grammar and literature, tafseer, mathematics and usool \r\n    al-fiqh &ndash; not philosophy, astrology or &lsquo;ilm al-kalaam, according to the most \r\n    sound opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Dasooqi said in his <i>Haashiyah<\/i> (2\/174): His phrase \r\n    &ldquo;according to the most sound opinion&rdquo; means that it is forbidden to read the \r\n    books of al-Baaji, Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi and &lsquo;Iyaad, unlike the one who says that it \r\n    is essential to learn it in order to understand &lsquo;aqeedah and basic religious \r\n    issues. But al-Ghazaali said that the one who has knowledge of &lsquo;ilm \r\n    al-kalaam knows nothing of religious beliefs except the beliefs that the \r\n    common people share, but they are distinguished by their ability to argue \r\n    and debate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Zakariya al-Ansaari (Shaafa&rsquo;i) said in <i>Asna \r\n    al-Mataalib<\/i> (4\/182): As for learning philosophy, magic (sleight of \r\n    hand), astrology, geomancy, natural science and witchcraft, it is haraam. \r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; al-Bahooti (Hanbali) said in <i>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (3\/34): The opposite of shar&rsquo;i knowledge is knowledge that is haraam or \r\n    makrooh. Haraam knowledge is like &lsquo;ilm al-kalaam in which they argue on the \r\n    basis of pure reason or speak in a manner that contradicts sound, \r\n    unambiguous reports. If they speak on the basis of reports only or on the \r\n    basis of texts and rational thought that is in accordance with them, then \r\n    this is the basis of religion and the way of ahl al-sunnah. This is what is \r\n    meant by the words of Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen. In his commentary he explains \r\n    that even better. [Haraam knowledge also includes] philosophy, magic \r\n    (sleight of hand), astrology and geomancy, as well as alchemy and natural \r\n    sciences.

He should also have \r\n    knowledge of how to derive rulings, meaning that he should be qualified. \r\n    Such a person may engage in ijtihaad. This category includes people like the \r\n    four imams &ndash; Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad &ndash; as well as \r\n    Sufyaan al-Thawri and al-Awzaa&rsquo;i. To these people Allaah gave the ability to \r\n    engage in ijtihaad. <\/p>\r\n    <p>The second category is \r\n    those who cannot engage in ijtihaad in absolute terms, but they are able to \r\n    weigh up the opinions of scholars and determine which is more correct, \r\n    because of their knowledge of which opinions are based on evidence and which \r\n    are not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Such a person must follow \r\n    that for which there is evidence, and shun that which goes against the \r\n    evidence. This action is called tarjeeh (weighing up what is more correct) \r\n    and is also known as al-ijtihaad al-madhhabi (ijtihaad based on the study of \r\n    different views).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The third category is those \r\n    who cannot engage in tarjeeh. Such a person is regarded as one of the \r\n    muqallideen (those who follow other scholars), but if he knows that some \r\n    opinion has no supporting evidence then he does not follow it. But so long \r\n    as he does not know and it is not clear to him that it is contrary to the \r\n    evidence, there is nothing wrong with him imitating and following the \r\n    opinions of the trustworthy scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fourth category is the \r\n    one who is unable to do any of the above; neither ijtihaad in an absolute \r\n    sense nor weighing what is more correct nor following a specific madhhab, \r\n    such as the ordinary Muslim, for example.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Such a person has to ask \r\n    the people of knowledge, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>\r\n    &ldquo;So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not&rdquo; [al-Nahl 16:43]<\/i>. \r\n    So he should ask the one who be believes is most trustworthy and the scholar \r\n    in whom he has the greatest confidence, of those whose knowledge and actions \r\n    he trusts, and follow his fatwa.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>These are the categories of \r\n    people with regard to this issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What a person should do is \r\n    know what level he is at, and he should not put himself in a higher position \r\n    than he deserves. Indeed, the matter is more serious than that. He should \r\n    fear Allaah, because it is the matter of halaal and haraam, of Paradise and \r\n    Hell, so he should not indulge in matters that he does not have the \r\n    knowledge and skill to deal with.

He is one of the \r\n    imams of our era in this regard. His books, tapes and halaqahs bear witness \r\n    to that.

Rather he was an experienced faqeeh \r\n    who adhered to the rules and guidelines of knowledge. It is not known that \r\n    he had his own principles on which he based his understanding of Islam, \r\n    rather he followed the same path as the imams of knowledge among the \r\n    righteous salaf, and his knowledge of hadeeth qualified him to base his \r\n    determination of which view is more correct on the ahaadeeth which he \r\n    believed to be saheeh (sound).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars of the \r\n    Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said of Shaykh al-Albaani:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This man is well known to \r\n    us for his knowledge and virtue, his veneration of and service to the Sunnah \r\n    and his support of Ahl al-Sunnah wa&rsquo;l-Jamaa&rsquo;ah in warning against fanaticism \r\n    and blind following.

We may also add to that <i>Aadaab al-Zafaaf<\/i> (wedding \r\n    etiquette) and <i>Tamaam al-Minnah fi&rsquo;l-Ta&rsquo;leeq &lsquo;ala Kitaab Fiqh al-Sunnah<\/i> \r\n    (a commentary on Fiqh al-Sunnah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>His tapes which are widely \r\n    available worldwide, of which one thousand are in circulation; those which \r\n    have not yet been produced contain 5000 hours of audio material. All of \r\n    these tapes are recordings of just some of his halaqahs, so how about if all \r\n    of his halaqahs had been recorded!?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Finally we should point out \r\n    some important matters:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) was a human being, who got things right and made \r\n    mistakes. No one should believe that his words are infallible. We have not \r\n    found anyone who claims this explicitly, but we find many who believe it \r\n    implicitly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not permissible for \r\n    any follower of Shaykh al-Albaani to continue to follow the shaykh&rsquo;s view if \r\n    it becomes clear to him that the opinion of another scholar of virtue is \r\n    stronger; rather he must follow the truth wherever it is and whoever it is \r\n    with. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is your advice to a \r\n    beginner seeker of knowledge? Should he follow one of the imams of the \r\n    madhhabs, or should he not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:7]<\/i>. If this is a new student who does not know how to \r\n    weigh up the evidence, then he has no choice but to follow a scholar, \r\n    whether he follows a former imam who is now deceased or a contemporary imam \r\n    &ndash; one of the scholars who is still alive &ndash; and asks him, which is better. \r\n    But if it becomes clear to him that this opinion is contrary to a saheeh \r\n    hadeeth, he must follow the saheeh hadeeth. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Al-&lsquo;Ilm<\/i> \r\n    p. 115&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) did not introduce anything new into Islamic \r\n    rulings and he often stated that he did not say anything that had not been \r\n    said before. So the one who criticizes the Shaykh by saying that he came up \r\n    with odd views and fatwas should fear Allaah and those who are fanatically \r\n    devoted to the Shaykh should also fear Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is not in accordance \r\n    with the methodology of Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) &ndash; \r\n    or of any of the imams &ndash;to look at the verse and hadeeth and then derive \r\n    from it whatever rulings one wants! Rather the Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) often complained about those who did that. He said: We were \r\n    suffering from blind following (taqleed) and now we are suffering from a \r\n    free-for-all! And he stated that blind following of the earlier scholars is \r\n    far better than this free-for-all; rather for the ordinary Muslim, following \r\n    a scholar is obligatory and this free-for-all is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one who follows the \r\n    Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) has to realize that the Shaykh himself \r\n    criticized blind following and enjoined seeking knowledge; he called on \r\n    people to learn and said that the Muslim should follow the evidence from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. If the Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) told people \r\n    not to follow Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad blindly, he was \r\n    more emphatic in telling them not to follow him blindly. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>6.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The ordinary Muslim who \r\n    agrees to follow Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him), or any \r\n    other scholar of the past or present, should not issue fatwas or argue with \r\n    others. If the those who follow a Shaykh or scholar adhered to this, the \r\n    ummah would be spared many of the bad things that we hear of here and \r\n    there.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>7.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one in whom Allaah \r\n    instils love of knowledge and the ability to weigh up the evidence and to \r\n    know which is more likely to be correct is not permitted to be a blind \r\n    follower of Shaykh al-Albaani or anyone else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The one who has no \r\n    knowledge and no ability to engage in ijtihaad must ask the scholars, \r\n    because Allaah says: <i>&ldquo;So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not \r\n    know&rdquo; [al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:7]<\/i>.Allaah does not enjoin us to ask them except for \r\n    the purpose of following their opinions. This is taqleed (following). But \r\n    with regard to taqleed what is forbidden is adhering to a specific madhhab \r\n    by following it in all cases and believing that this is the way to Allaah, \r\n    so one follows it even if it goes against the evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But the one who has the \r\n    ability to work things out (ijtihaad), such as the seeker of knowledge who \r\n    has an abundant share of knowledge may engage in ijtihaad on the basis of \r\n    the evidence, and follow the one who he thinks is correct, or is most likely \r\n    to be correct.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for the ordinary Muslim \r\n    and the beginner seeker of knowledge, they should strive to follow the one \r\n    who they think is closer to the truth, because of his abundant knowledge, \r\n    strong religious commitment and piety.

Thus the intention will become \r\n    sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The one \r\n    who is seeking knowledge may not find it anywhere except in these colleges, \r\n    so he may enter them with the intention of seeking knowledge, and it does \r\n    not matter if he gets any certificates after that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; If a \r\n    person intends to attain two types of goodness at the same time &ndash; goodness \r\n    in this world and goodness in the Hereafter, there is nothing wrong with \r\n    that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And \r\n    whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him \r\n    to get out (from every difficulty).<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>3.&nbsp;And He \r\n    will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts \r\n    his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will \r\n    accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>\r\n    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is an \r\n    encouragement to fear Allaah with regard to worldly affairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If it is \r\n    said: If a person seeks some worldly goal in his work, how can it be said \r\n    that he is sincere?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The answer \r\n    is that if he is sincere in his worship and does not intend to show off or \r\n    seek people&rsquo;s praise for his worship, rather he is seeking some material \r\n    benefit from this worship, then he is not like one who shows off and tries \r\n    to draw closer to people by doing something that should be done only in \r\n    order to draw closer to Allaah, wanting them to praise him for it. However, \r\n    his seeking this material gain could detract from his sincerity and could \r\n    become a kind of shirk, and his status could become lower than that of one \r\n    who seeks the Hereafter only.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I would like \r\n    to take this opportunity to point out that when some people speak about the \r\n    benefits of acts of worship they speak only of worldly benefits. For \r\n    example, they say that prayer is a kind of exercise and calms the nerves, \r\n    and the fasting helps to remove toxins and organize one&rsquo;s eating. We should \r\n    not make worldly benefits the be-all and end-all, because that will lead to \r\n    a weakening of sincerity and failure to seek the Hereafter. Hence Allaah \r\n    stated the reason for fasting in His Book, namely that it beings about taqwa \r\n    (piety, fear of Allaah). The religious benefits are what really matter, and \r\n    the worldly benefits are secondary. When we speak to the common people we \r\n    should tell them about the religious aspects, and when we speak to those who \r\n    are not convinced by anything but material matters we should tell them about \r\n    both the religious and worldly aspects.

People vary in their level of understanding and \r\n    ability to derive rulings from the evidence. There are some for whom it is \r\n    permissible to follow (taqleed), and indeed it may be obligatory in their \r\n    case. There are others who can only follow the shar&rsquo;i evidence. In <i>\r\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> this question was answered in a detailed \r\n    manner, which is worth quoting here in full.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Question:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is the ruling on following one of the four madhhabs in \r\n    all cases and situations?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Committee replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Praise be to Allaah, and blessings and peace be upon His \r\n    Messenger and his family and companions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly: the four madhhabs are named after the four imams &ndash; \r\n    Imam Abu Haneefah, Imam Maalik, Imam al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Imam Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: These imams learned fiqh (jurisprudence) from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and they are mujtahideen in this regard. The mujtahid \r\n    either gets it right, in which case he will have two rewards, the reward for \r\n    his ijtihaad and the reward for getting it right, or he will get it wrong, \r\n    in which case he will be rewarded for his ijtihaad and will be forgiven for \r\n    his mistake.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: the one who is able to derive rulings from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah should take from them like those who came before him; it \r\n    is not right for him to follow blindly (taqleed) when he is believes that \r\n    the truth lies elsewhere. Rather he should follow that which he believes is \r\n    the truth. It is permissible for him to follow in matters in which he is \r\n    unable to come to a conclusion based on the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and he needs \r\n    guidelines concerning a particular issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp; Whoever does not have the ability to derive \r\n    rulings himself is permitted to follow one whom he feels comfortable \r\n    following. If he is not comfortable following him then he should ask until \r\n    he finds someone with whom he is comfortable. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fifthly:&nbsp; From the above \r\n    it is clear that we should not follow their opinions in all situations and \r\n    at all times, because they may make mistakes, but we may follow their views \r\n    that are sound and are based on the evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah<\/i>, 5\/28&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah<\/i>, no. 3323:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whoever is qualified to \r\n    derive rulings from the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and has strong knowledge in that \r\n    regard, even if that is with the help of the legacy of fiqh that we have \r\n    inherited from earlier scholars of Islam, has the right to do that, so he \r\n    can act upon it himself and explain it in disputes and issue fatwas to those \r\n    who consult him. Whoever is not qualified to do that has to ask trustworthy \r\n    people who so that he may learn the rulings from their books and act upon \r\n    that, without limiting his asking or his reading to one of the scholars of \r\n    the four madhhabs. Rather people refer to the four imams because they are so \r\n    well known and their books are well written and widely available.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whoever says that it is obligatory for the learned people to \r\n    follow the scholars blindly in all cases is making a mistake and being \r\n    inflexible, and is thinking that these learned people are inadequate, and he \r\n    is restricting something that is broad in scope.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whoever says that we \r\n    should limit following to the four madhhabs is also mistaken, because he is \r\n    restricting something that is broad in scope with no evidence for doing so. \r\n    With regard to the common (i.e., uneducated) man there is no difference \r\n    between the four imams and others such as al-Layth ibn Sa&rsquo;d, al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and \r\n    other fuqaha&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah<\/i>, 5\/41&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in Fatwa no. 1591:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    None of them called people to follow his madhhab, or was \r\n    partisan in following it, or obliged anyone else to act in accordance with \r\n    it or with a specific madhhab. Rather they used to call people to follow the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and they would comment on the texts of Islam, and \r\n    explain its basic principles and discuss minor issues according to general \r\n    guidelines, and issue fatwas concerning what people asked about, without \r\n    obliging any of their students or anyone else to follow their views. Rather \r\n    they criticized those who did that and said that their opinions should be \r\n    cast aside if they went against a saheeh hadeeth. One of them said: &ldquo;If the \r\n    hadeeth is saheeh then that is my madhhab.&rdquo; May Allaah have mercy on them \r\n    all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not obligatory for anyone to follow a particular \r\n    madhhab, rather we should strive to learn the truth if possible, or to seek \r\n    the help of Allaah in doing so, then to rely on the legacy that the earlier \r\n    Muslim scholars left behind for those who came after them, thus making it \r\n    easier for them to understand and apply the texts. Whoever cannot derive \r\n    rulings from the texts etc for some reason that prevents him from doing so \r\n    should ask trustworthy scholars for whatever rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah he needs, \r\n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So ask the people of the Reminder [Scriptures &mdash; the \r\n    Tawraat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel)] if you do not know&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:7]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So he has to strive to ask one whom he trusts among those who \r\n    are well known for their knowledge, virtue, piety and righteousness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, \r\n    5\/56&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The madhhab of Abu \r\n    Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) is the most widespread madhhab among \r\n    the Muslims, and perhaps one of the reasons for that is that the Ottoman \r\n    caliphs followed this madhhab and they ruled the Muslim lands for more than \r\n    six centuries. That does not mean that the madhhab of Abu Haneefah is the \r\n    most sound madhhab or that every ijtihaad in it is correct, rather like \r\n    other madhhabs it contains some things that are correct and some that are \r\n    incorrect.

The best way \r\n          that I have seen is that if a person memorizes something on one day, \r\n          he should read it again early the following morning. This is a great \r\n          help in remembering what he memorized on the previous day.

But if a person forgets it \r\n          because of some natural reason or because of duties which he got involved \r\n          in, which kept him away from revising what he mad memorized, in this \r\n          case he is not guilty of sin. <i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond \r\n          his scope&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:286 &ndash; interpretation of the meaning]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          It was reported that the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led his companions in prayer, \r\n          and he forgot an aayah.

This is according to the testimony of non-Muslim doctors, let \r\n    alone Muslim ones.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting plays an effective role in treating psychological \r\n    problems and strengthening the will-power of the fasting person, softening \r\n    his feelings, and making him love to do good and keep away from \r\n    argumentative and hostile tendencies; it also increases his spiritual \r\n    feelings. So it strengthens his personality and makes him more able to bear \r\n    problems and burdens. Undoubtedly this is reflected positively in a person&rsquo;s \r\n    health.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is one aspect. From another angle, fasting also plays a \r\n    role in treating many physical disorders, such as diseases of the digestive \r\n    system like gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, liver diseases and \r\n    indigestion, as well as treating obesity, hardening of the arteries, high \r\n    blood pressure, angina, asthma, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Swiss doctor Barcellus wrote:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The benefit of hunger as a remedy is many times better than \r\n    using medicines. Doctor Helb used to forbid his patients to eat for several \r\n    days, then he would offer them light meals. In general, fasting plays a role \r\n    in destroying the worn-out tissues at the time of hunger, then rebuilds them \r\n    when food is ingested. This is the reason why some scientists, including \r\n    Pashutin, regard fasting as a means of restoring youth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Tom Burns of the Columbia School of Journalism says: I regard \r\n    fasting as an experience which is deeply spiritual more than physical. \r\n    Despite the fact that I started to fast with the aim of losing excess \r\n    weight, I realized that fasting is very beneficial for the mind. It helps me \r\n    to see with greater clarity and to develop new thoughts and to focus my \r\n    feelings. Within only a few days of starting my fast in the spa I began to \r\n    feel that I was passing through a very spiritual experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Of course fasting may be harmful and extremely difficult for \r\n    some people in certain situations; Allaah has exempted them from fasting &ndash; \r\n    such as those who are sick and those who are traveling.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover the benefits of fasting come when one adheres to the \r\n    etiquette of fasting, such as delaying suhoor, hastening to break the fast, \r\n    not being extravagant in the manner or amount of food eaten, and avoiding \r\n    being extravagant in serving a large variety of foods.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Encyclopaedia Britannica says: Most religions enjoin \r\n    fasting and it it is something that people used to do even at times other \r\n    than religious occasions; some individuals fast in response to human nature. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the twentieth century a number of books appeared in \r\n    America and Europe which spoke of the medical benefits of fasting. There was\r\n    <i>Treating sickness by fasting<\/i> by Shelton; <i>Medical Fasting: The \r\n    Ideal Nutritional System<\/i> by Alan Coutt; <i>Fasting, the Elixir of Life<\/i> \r\n    by Enrique Tanner; <i>Return to a Healthy Life through Medical Fasting<\/i> \r\n    by Watzener.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting is of great benefit in treating some diseases of the \r\n    heart, because 10% of the blood that the heart pumps to the body goes to the \r\n    digestive system during the digestive process; this amount is reduced during \r\n    fasting, when the digestive process does not occur during the day. This \r\n    means that the heart works less and can rest more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting is also used to treat skin diseases, because if the \r\n    amount of water in the blood is reduced, the amount of water in the skin is \r\n    also reduced.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It increases the skin&rsquo;s impermeability and resistance to \r\n    bacterial disease.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It reduces the extent of skin diseases that can spread over a \r\n    large area of the body such as psoriasis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It reduces allergies and other skin problems. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting reduces toxic secretions in the intestines and \r\n    reduces the fermentation that can lead to ulcers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are some of the health benefits of fasting, from which \r\n    you may understand that what that communist atheist says has no sound \r\n    basis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover we fast in obedience to the command of Allaah Who \r\n    has enjoined us to fast, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;O you who believe!

After Fajr prayer, we were speaking \r\n          about the Tijaani sect and how it is a false sect that that apostatized \r\n          from Islam. I started to say what I knew about them, then a man came \r\n          and asked me for permission to interpret my words into Hausa.&nbsp; \r\n          I gave him permission, and he started to interpret. Then a man came \r\n          rushing in and said, &ldquo;This man who is interpreting for you is praising \r\n          the Tijaaniyyah.&rdquo; I was astonished and I said, &ldquo;<i>Inna Lillaahi wa \r\n          inna ilayhi raaji&rsquo;oon<\/i> (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to \r\n          Him we shall return).&rdquo; If I had known this language I would not have \r\n          needed these cheaters.

The end of history will never occur before the emergence of all \r\n    of the lesser and greater signs of the Hour. One of those signs is that \r\n    there will be conflict between the people of truth, who are the Muslims, and \r\n    the people of evil and falsehood, who are all of those who oppose the \r\n    religion of truth, Islam, and strive to extinguish its light. There are two \r\n    distinct features of this conflict which will occur before the end of life. \r\n    The first is a conflict between the Muslims and the people of the cross, as \r\n    is mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of the battles at the end \r\n    of time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second \r\n    is the battle between the Muslims at the time of the descent of &lsquo;Eesa (peace \r\n    be upon him) with the Dajjaal and his followers among the Jews. Then Ya&rsquo;jooj \r\n    and Ma&rsquo;jooj (Gog and Magog) will appear, and they will die as one.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Then the \r\n    Muslims will rule the earth, then everyone in whose heart is faith equal to \r\n    a grain of corn will die, when a cold wind blows that will take the souls of \r\n    the believers. Then the Hour will begin soon after that and it will come \r\n    upon the most evil of people who are scattered throughout the earth. The \r\n    universe will not be destroyed when there is still one believer on earth, \r\n    but when faith is gone it will be destroyed, because belief in Allaah is a \r\n    reason for life to continue.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The point is \r\n    that it is not permissible for a Muslim to believe that the end of the world \r\n    will occur in a manner different to that which is mentioned in the proven \r\n    texts of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; It is \r\n    not permissible for a Muslim to believe that heavenly bodies can bring \r\n    benefit or ward off harm, or that they can bring provision or bring joy or \r\n    sorrow, or that they have any control on the lives of men, and so on. This \r\n    is a polytheistic belief (shirk) which is held by people of Jaahiliyyah. It \r\n    is stated in the saheeh ahaadeeth that whoever believes in this is guilty of \r\n    kufr. Thus it is clear that all claims made by astrologers are lies, kufr \r\n    and shirk (the association of others with Allaah, may He be exalted).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The planets \r\n    are no more than bodies that are subject to the decree of Allaah and play \r\n    their role in the universe. This does not mean that they do not behave \r\n    according to the natural laws according to which Allaah has established the \r\n    universe or have an effect on one another, as a result of which calamities, \r\n    disasters and earthquakes occur. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah mentioned that \r\n    eclipses affect the earth. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;A sign by means of which Allaah instils fear in His \r\n    slaves&rdquo; i.e., it points to the approach of events that have been decreed by \r\n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, in order to instil fear and remind \r\n    people of Allaah, an eloquent reminder of His power, a reminder of the end \r\n    of the world, a reminder to him not to transgress and to remember always \r\n    that he is on the earth of Allaah which, if He willed, He could cause to \r\n    shake beneath his feet, and he would not be able to do anything.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Hence \r\n    earthquakes usually happen after eclipses, as do destructive storms. We seek \r\n    refuge with Allaah from His wrath. He mentioned that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sought refuge with Allaah from the \r\n    moon, because it has an effect, otherwise why would he seek refuge from it? \r\n    But its effect is physical in nature like other physical effects that Allaah \r\n    has created.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So long as \r\n    the Muslim believes that this all happens by the will and decree of Allaah, \r\n    and that they are signs by means of which Allaah instils fear in His slaves, \r\n    then it does not matter. But it is essential to understand the relationship \r\n    between the movement of the planets and the sun and the movements of the \r\n    earth, and the layers of the earth and the movement of the winds, on a \r\n    scientific basis, and the interaction of natural scientific laws.

The ruling in this case is not the same as the ruling on one who \r\n    learns witchcraft or teaches it to someone else, because witchcraft is \r\n    haraam in and of itself because of what it involves of shirk and worshipping \r\n    the jinn instead of Allah.

It was classed as da&rsquo;eef by al-Albaani in <i>Da&rsquo;eef al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following advice will answer your questions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best time to seek knowledge is when one is young, when \r\n    one is alert and has a lot of energy. It does not matter if a person misses \r\n    out on knowledge&nbsp; when he is young or in childhood, because when a student \r\n    is young he is able to make up for what he has missed, if he works hard.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in his <i>Musannaf<\/i> (5\/284) that \r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Learn before you \r\n    reach a position of prominence. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu &lsquo;Ubayd said in <i>Ghareeb al-Hadeeth<\/i> (3\/369):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He says: Acquire knowledge when you are still young, before \r\n    you become leaders. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When al-Bukhaari quoted these words in a mu&rsquo;allaq report in \r\n    his <i>Saheeh<\/i> (p. 39), he followed that by saying:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And after you reach a position of prominence; the companions \r\n    of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) acquired \r\n    knowledge when they were older. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) meant was \r\n    that being older and being in a prominent position does not prevent one from \r\n    learning. Many of the Sahaabah became Muslim when they were older, such as \r\n    Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him), then they became leaders of \r\n    knowledge, light and guidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I also give you the glad tidings that the twenties are the \r\n    best age to seek knowledge, because you are still young and strong. The \r\n    scholars chose this age for learning difficult matters, and what comes \r\n    before that is only memorizing Qur&rsquo;aan and some texts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Tadreeb al-Raawi<\/i> (1\/414):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars said: It is mustahabb to start listening \r\n    to (i.e., learning) hadeeth after the age of thirty. This was the view of \r\n    the people of Syria. And it was said after the age of twenty, which was the \r\n    view of the people of Kufah. Sufyaan al-Thawri said: If a man wanted to \r\n    learn hadeeth, he would worship for twenty years beforehand. Abu &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n    al-Zubayri, who was a Shaafa&rsquo;i scholar, said: It is mustahabb to learn \r\n    hadeeth in one&rsquo;s twenties, because it is when his mind reaches maturity. \r\n    Before that, I prefer a person to occupy himself in memorizing Qur&rsquo;aan and \r\n    studying fiqh. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now you are at the beginning of seeking knowledge, and you \r\n    have not missed anything, in sha Allaah. Try to make sure that your \r\n    beginning is sound and strong, and do not waste any of your time, for what \r\n    is missed can never be regained.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As seeking knowledge is prescribed throughout one's life, and \r\n    life ends only at death, it is essential for the seeker of knowledge to \r\n    combine meeting worldly needs with pursuit of knowledge. That includes \r\n    marriage, because marriage should never be a barrier to seeking knowledge. \r\n    If the seeker of knowledge regards the pursuit of knowledge as the greatest \r\n    act of worship in which he may spend the years of his life, then marriage, \r\n    work and taking care of worldly needs only serve that lifetime project, \r\n    which is worshipping Allaah by acquiring knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is how the Sahaabah, Taabi&rsquo;een and the early scholars \r\n    were. Some of them were merchants, some were governors, some were married to \r\n    one wife and some to four, and some had families, but that did not distract \r\n    them from acquiring knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Haamid al-Ghazaali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>Ihya&rsquo; &lsquo;Uloom al-Deen <\/i>(2\/44):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a man has the right quality and is free from problems, so \r\n    his wealth is all halaal and he is of good character and he is serious about \r\n    his religious commitment, then getting married will not distract him from \r\n    Allaah. Moreover, he is a young man who needs to calm his desires, and he is \r\n    alone and needs someone to help him in looking after his house and keep him \r\n    chaste. No doubt marriage is better for him. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked in <i>Liqa&rsquo; al-Baab il-Maftooh<\/i> (3\/56):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is a seeker of shar&rsquo;i knowledge who wants to get \r\n    married, but he is afraid that if he gets married, that will distract him \r\n    from seeking knowledge. What advice can you give him?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Marriage is not an obstacle to pursuing knowledge, rather it \r\n    may help in the pursuit of knowledge. A man may be blessed with a wife who \r\n    reads and writes and can help him. Even if she does not do that, at least \r\n    she can take away waswaas and thoughts of marriage, for marriage helps in \r\n    the pursuit of knowledge, because it provides a suitable atmosphere for \r\n    pursuing knowledge, a calm and peaceful atmosphere. The wife can free up \r\n    lots of time for her husband that he used to spend in meeting his needs in \r\n    the house. So my advice to this young man is to go ahead and get married, \r\n    for there is a lot of good in it, and it is obedience to the command of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and following his \r\n    Sunnah and the Sunnah of his fellow-Messengers. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said in <i>Fataawa &lsquo;Ulama&rsquo; al-Balad al-Haraam<\/i> (277):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My advice to all young men and women is to hasten to get \r\n    married if they are able to, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O young people, whoever among you can afford \r\n    to get married, let him do so, for it helps one to lower the gaze and \r\n    protect the private parts (i.e., remain chaste). Whoever cannot afford it, \r\n    let him fast, for it is a protection for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; That serves many interests \r\n    as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) pointed out, \r\n    such as lowering the gaze, guarding one's chastity, increasing the numbers \r\n    of the ummah and keeping one safe from any negative consequences. End \r\n    quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for speaking about the time required for seeking \r\n    knowledge, this is something in which people vary and no one has the right \r\n    to stipulate specific times. I will give you some examples here, then leave \r\n    it to you to work it out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-&lsquo;Attaar, the student of al-Nawawi, said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) told me that he \r\n    never spent any time, by night or by day, without being busy with knowledge, \r\n    and even on the road he would be reading. He continued like this for six \r\n    years, then he began to write books. He never ate during the day or the \r\n    night, except a meal after &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer, and he drank only once, just \r\n    before dawn. He said: I am afraid that my body may become hydrated and make \r\n    me want to sleep. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Aqeel al-Hanbali said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for me to waste an hour of my life even \r\n    when my tongue is not busy with memorizing or debating with others, or my \r\n    eyes are not busy in reading. I would think even when I am resting or \r\n    relaxing, so I would not get up without an idea to write down. I limit the \r\n    time I spend eating as much as I can, to such an extent that I choose a few \r\n    crumbs and follow it with water rather than bread, because bread takes more \r\n    time to chew, so as to save my time for reading or writing down some useful \r\n    ideas. The best thing for the wise man to save is time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote. See <i>Salaah al-Ummah<\/i> (4\/169-175).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The seeker of knowledge should not ignore current events and \r\n    the state of his society. These are essential to knowledge. The faqeeh is \r\n    the one who understands the texts properly and understands the reality to \r\n    which he applies them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>Liqa&rsquo; al-Baab il-Maftooh<\/i> (1\/330):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is well known that a person should have knowledge of real \r\n    life, so that he will know how people are living. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicated this in the words he said \r\n    when he sent Mu&rsquo;aadh ibn Jabal to Yemen: &ldquo;You are going to some people of \r\n    the Book,&rdquo; and he told them about their situation. But it is not permissible \r\n    under any circumstances to let that outweigh his study of religion. Neither \r\n    youth nor anyone else should focus only on what is happening here and there \r\n    and focus only on issues that he cannot do anything about. Moreover, if he \r\n    is keen to set the affairs of the ummah straight, proper understanding of \r\n    religion is the basic requirement. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When Allaah wills good for a person, \r\n    He grants him proper understanding of religion.&rdquo; Proper understanding \r\n    requires applying proper understanding of Islam to people&rsquo;s lives, but it is \r\n    not permissible under any circumstances to focus on studying life and \r\n    reality at the expense of studying religion to such an extent that a person \r\n    has no concern but reading newspapers and magazines, and so on, and neglects \r\n    to study the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But you know that much of what is shown on satellite channels \r\n    is things that it is not permissible for a Muslim to watch, because the \r\n    programs show women who are displaying their beauty, and are accompanied by \r\n    music. Allaah has caused us to have no need of that, praise be to Allaah, \r\n    because you can watch what you need on a channel that is free of things that \r\n    are haraam, or a trustworthy Islamic news website, especially since we agree \r\n    that what is required in your case is to familiarize yourself in general \r\n    with current affairs, then focusing on the issue which you care most about, \r\n    which is seeking knowledge and doing da&rsquo;wah, especially if it is an evil \r\n    that you can change, or something good that you can enjoin or take part in.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if your ambition is to reach the same level of knowledge \r\n    as the great imams, that is a blessing which Allaah bestows on whomsoever He \r\n    will, and that is not difficult for Allaah. But you must prove what you say, \r\n    and the way to prove it is by striving hard to acquire knowledge and \r\n    devoting yourself and your wealth to that, then seeking Allaah&rsquo;s help to \r\n    enable you to reach the status of an imam in knowledge and religious \r\n    commitment, for that is a quality that Allaah commends in His slaves. Allaah \r\n    says of the attributes of the slaves of the Most Merciful (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And those who say: Our Lord!

This makes us repeat this \r\n    advice in your case and the case of those who are like you.&nbsp; The principle \r\n    is that the permissibility of that is limited to situations in which the \r\n    interests served by doing it are greater than the negative results thereof, \r\n    or in situations where arguing is kept at a level of friendly debate rather \r\n    than fighting.&nbsp; <i>Fath al-Qadeer<\/i> by al-Shawkaani, 1\/527.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The purpose \r\n    which you seek to achieve by debating with the People of the Book or other \r\n    types of people who associate others with Allaah, or people who follow whims \r\n    and desires or innovations, can only be achieved if it is undertaken by \r\n    those who are qualified for it, who have sufficient knowledge of their own \r\n    religion and the other religion to debate it, and who also follow the shar&rsquo;i \r\n    etiquette that is prescribed for us in such matters.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Because the \r\n    followers of the Prophets are people of knowledge and justice, when the \r\n    followers of Islam and the Sunnah speak with the kuffaar and followers of \r\n    bid&rsquo;ah, they speak with knowledge and justice, not with speculation and \r\n    whims. Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Judges are of three types, two of whom will be in the Fire and one in \r\n    Paradise.

And \r\n    seeking knowledge may be an individual obligation. The guideline is if it is \r\n    needed for an act of worship that he wants to do or a transaction or \r\n    interaction he wants to engage in; in that case he must learn how to worship \r\n    Allaah by doing this act of worship, and how to undertake that transaction \r\n    etc. Apart from that, seeking knowledge is a communal obligation and the \r\n    seeker of knowledge should feel that he is undertaking a communal obligation \r\n    so that he will attain the reward for undertaking an obligation as well as \r\n    gaining knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From <i>Kitaab al-&lsquo;Ilm<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You have done well by \r\n    bringing the CDs of the lessons, because that is a means of seeking \r\n    knowledge, although it does not mean that you do not need to sit with the \r\n    scholars and learn from them, and ask them about anything you do not \r\n    understand.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It seems that in your situation, where you are trying to \r\n    decide whether it is better to give the adhaan and take care of the mosque, \r\n    or to seek knowledge that is not an individual obligation, that you should \r\n    try to combine the best of both, by regularly attending some classes, and \r\n    continuing to look after the mosque, and make up for the classes you miss by \r\n    using the CDs, as well as asking the scholars about anything you do not \r\n    understand. If the administration of the mosque do not agree with you being \r\n    absent sometimes, then give precedence to seeking knowledge, for it is a \r\n    source of honour and status in this world and in the Hereafter, especially \r\n    since there will never be a shortage of people to give the adhaan and take \r\n    care of the mosque, but those who are serious in the pursuit of knowledge \r\n    are few and far between.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, explaining \r\n    the virtue of knowledge:&nbsp; (108): Many of the imams clearly stated that the \r\n    best of deeds after the obligatory duties is seeking knowledge. Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i \r\n    said: There is nothing after the obligatory duties that is better than \r\n    seeking knowledge. This is what his companions narrated was his opinion. \r\n    This was also stated by Sufyaan al-Thawri, and the Hanafis narrated this \r\n    from Abu Haneefah. Three opinions were narrated from Imam Ahmed:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The first was that the best of deeds after the obligatory \r\n    duties is seeking knowledge, because it was said to him: &ldquo;What thing is \r\n    dearest to you, for me to sit at night copying (texts) or to offer voluntary \r\n    prayers? He said: Your copying (texts) and learning about your religion from \r\n    it, that is dearer to me. Al-Khallaal quoted many texts from him in <i>\r\n    Kitaab al-&lsquo;Ilm<\/i> about the virtue of knowledge, for example, he said: \r\n    People&rsquo;s need for knowledge is greater than their need for food and drink.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second is that the best of deeds after the obligatory \r\n    duties is voluntary prayer, and he quoted as evidence for this the words \r\n    &ldquo;Know that the best of your deeds is prayer&rdquo; and the hadeeth of Abu Dharr, \r\n    when he asked him (the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him)) about prayer and he said &ldquo;(It) is the best that has been prescribed.&rdquo; \r\n    And he quoted the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) advised the one who asked to be close to him in Paradise to do \r\n    a lot of prostration, i.e., prayer, and the fact that in another hadeeth he \r\n    said: &ldquo;You should prostrate, for you do not do one prostration for Allaah, \r\n    but Allaah will raise you one degree (in status) thereby and will remove one \r\n    sin from you thereby.&rdquo; And there are many other ahaadeeth which speak of the \r\n    virtue of prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The third opinion is that jihad is the best of deeds, and he \r\n    (Imam Ahmad) said: I cannot think of anything that matches jihad. And there \r\n    is no doubt that most of the ahaadeeth speak of prayer and jihad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to Maalik, Ibn al-Qaasim said: I heard Maalik \r\n    say: Some people pursued worship and ignored knowledge, then they engaged in \r\n    an armed rebellion against the ummah of Muhammad. If they had sought \r\n    knowledge, it would have prevented them from doing that. Maalik said: Abu \r\n    Moosa al-Ash&rsquo;ari wrote to &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (saying) that there are \r\n    people with us who read the Qur&rsquo;aan, such and such a number of them. &lsquo;Umar \r\n    wrote back to him, telling him to allocate them a stipend from the bayt \r\n    al-Maal (treasury of the Islamic state). The following year, he wrote to him \r\n    saying that many people, more than before, were reading the Qur&rsquo;aan. &lsquo;Umar \r\n    wrote back to him telling him to erase their names from the record saying, \r\n    &ldquo;I am afraid that people will be hasty in reading the Qur&rsquo;aan and will not \r\n    understand the religion properly, then they will distort its meanings.&rdquo; Ibn \r\n    Wahb said: Maalik ibn Anas was in front of me and I put my tablets down and \r\n    got up to pray, and he said: &ldquo;What you have got up for is better than that \r\n    which you have left.&rdquo; From <i>Miftaah Daar al-Sa&rsquo;aadah<\/i>, 1\/119.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows \r\n    best<\/span>.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9872","question_id":"9872","answers":"Praise   be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>Seeking knowledge, if this knowledge is something obligatory, is not dependent on having \r\n    parents&rsquo; permission, but if it is supererogatory knowledge then it is essential to have their permission.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Muslim (2549) narrated that &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Amr ibn al-&lsquo;Aas said: A man came to the Prophet of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &ldquo;I give you my oath of \r\n    allegiance, promising to migrate and fight in jihad, seeking the reward of Allaah.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Are either of your parents alive?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, \r\n    both of them.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;And do you want to seek the reward of Allaah?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Then go back to your parents, and keep good \r\n    company with them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Seeking knowledge is one of the kinds of \r\n    jihad.

And you should not seek to show off to people with your knowledge or to argue with the foolish.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You should memorize some of the Qur&rsquo;aan. This \r\n    can only be achieved by following and sticking to a daily program of memorizing a certain amount. It may be a good idea to commit to learning a \r\n    small amount, and do not increase it even if you find that you have more time and energy on some occasions, for a small deed that is done \r\n    regularly is better than a large deed done intermittently.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You should read summaries of all branches of \r\n    knowledge, and leave the detailed works until later. In almost every branch of knowledge there are books which give a gradual approach, starting \r\n    with brief discussions and ending with lengthy and detailed analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You should strive to memorize these texts if \r\n    you can, because memorizing evidence, whether from the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah, and memorizing the texts of knowledge will help you to follow the \r\n    correct path to knowledge. The scholars said, &ldquo;Whoever memorizes the texts has excelled.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>You should strive to study the commentaries \r\n    on these books. The best is to listen to recordings. We recommend the sister, and every Muslim, to listen to the lessons of Shaykh Muhammad ibn \r\n    Saalih ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, because there is no branch of knowledge that he did not discuss on tapes that are easy to get hold of and they are now \r\n    available on the internet.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She should look for sisters who can help her \r\n    to seek knowledge, with whom she can read and study.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Just as she allocates time for reading \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan, she should also allocate time for all other branches of knowledge. She should read a little about Tawheed and about hadeeth and fiqh and \r\n    all other branches of knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>She should seek the help of Allaah in her \r\n    pursuit of knowledge and da&rsquo;wah.

This way is quicker and more reliable for knowledge, because in the first method a \r\n    seeker of knowledge may go astray without realizing, either because he misunderstands or because of a lack of knowledge, or for some other reason. \r\n    But if a seeker of knowledge combines both methods, that is better and more complete. The student should get his priorities straight, and brief \r\n    books on various subjects before studying books that deal with them in detail, so that he will move from one level to another, and he will not \r\n    move on to the next level until he has mastered the one that comes before it, so that his progress will be sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Kitaab al-&lsquo;Ilm<\/i>, \r\n    p. 64, 65&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to acting upon what Allaah has \r\n    revealed, that cannot be done before knowing what Allaah has revealed, So the Muslim must seek knowledge, then when he knows, he must act upon \r\n    what he has learned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Abu &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami said: Those who \r\n    used to teach us the Qur&rsquo;aan, &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn &lsquo;Uthmaan and &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood and others, told us that when they learned ten verses from the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), they would not move on from that until they learned what was in them of knowledge and \r\n    put it into practice.

This \r\n          is the view of all of us, beyond a doubt. After that comes that which \r\n          has been narrated from the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs, the Sahaabah and \r\n          the imams of Islam among the earlier generations (the salaf).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          With regard to what the later and contemporary scholars \r\n          speak about, it deals with things that have happened more recently, \r\n          which they know better about. If a person takes from their books that \r\n          which will benefit him in that respect, then he will have gained a great \r\n          deal.

If you cannot combine them, then you should start \r\n          with (seeking) knowledge, because that is the basis on which da&rsquo;wah \r\n          rests. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, \r\n          in the tenth chapter of <i>Kitaab al-&lsquo;Ilm<\/i> (the Book of Knowledge), \r\n          <i>Baab al-&lsquo;Ilm qabla al-Qawl wa&rsquo;l<\/i>-&lsquo;Aml (Chapter on (acquiring) \r\n          knowledge before speaking or acting).

With regard to the superficial knowledge \r\n          by which a person knows just a little about the issues that he comes \r\n          across, as the common people know, without any knowledge of its principles \r\n          or what it is based upon, this is very limited knowledge which does \r\n          not enable a person to defend the truth at a time of necessity in the \r\n          face of the arguments posed by those who propagate falsehood.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          What I advise the Muslim youth to do is to concentrate \r\n          their efforts on seeking knowledge whilst also calling people to Allaah \r\n          as much as they can and in a manner that will not prevent them from \r\n          seeking knowledge, because seeking knowledge is jihad for the sake of \r\n          Allaah. Hence the scholars said that if a person who is able to earn \r\n          a living is kept from doing so by his pursuit of knowledge, he should \r\n          be given zakaah, because that is a kind of jihad for the sake of Allaah, \r\n          unlike one who does not work in order to concentrate on worship, who \r\n          should not be given zakaah because he is able to work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-&lsquo;Ilm, p. 168-170"},{"id":"9880","question_id":"9880","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise be to \r\n          Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah \r\n          have mercy on him) was asked this question, and he replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          It is good if a person focuses on one shaykh and makes \r\n          him his main source, especially if he is a young beginner, for if the \r\n          young beginner seeks knowledge from a number of people he will be confused. \r\n          For people are not all of one opinion, especially nowadays.

But now, everyone who \r\n          has memorized a hadeeth or two says, &ldquo;I am the imaam to be followed. \r\n          Imaam Ahmad was a man and we are men.&rdquo; So now there is chaos. Everyone \r\n          is issuing fatwaas and sometimes you hear fatwaas from these people \r\n          which may you weep and laugh at the same time.

Hence our shaykhs forbade us to read <i>al-Mughni<\/i> and \r\n          <i>Sharh al-Muhadhdhab<\/i> and other books which contain numerous opinions \r\n          when we were starting out. One of our shaykhs told us that Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah \r\n          ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan Baabiteen (may Allaah have mercy on him), who was \r\n          one of the great shaykhs of Najd, only read al-Rawd al-Murabba&rsquo; and \r\n          never read anything else.

If he develops this intention, then his intention \r\n          is sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Secondly, anyone who wants to gain knowledge can only \r\n          find it in these colleges, so he should enter with the intention of \r\n          seeking knowledge and not let himself be affected by whatever certificates \r\n          he may gain after that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Thirdly, if a person wants to earn the good things of \r\n          both this world and the Hereafter by means of his work, there is nothing \r\n          wrong with that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>&ldquo;And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to \r\n          Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <h2>And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \r\n          imagine&rdquo;<\/h2>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <i>[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]<\/i><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;This is encouragement to fear Allaah with regard \r\n          to a worldly matter.<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;If it is asked, with regard to a person who does \r\n          what he does for worldly purposes, how can we say that he is sincere? \r\n          <\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;Our answer is:<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;If he is being sincere in his worship, and he does \r\n          not pay attention to people at all, and he is not doing it to show off \r\n          to people and earn their praise for his worship, rather his aim to earn \r\n          some materialistic gains as one of the results of his worship &ndash; then \r\n          this is not the same as showing off and trying to draw closer to people \r\n          by doing things which are only for drawing closer to Allaah, hoping \r\n          that people will praise him for that. But by hoping for material gain \r\n          from this action, his intention is undermined and it becomes a kind \r\n          of shirk, and his status is lower than that of someone whose intention \r\n          is focused solely on the Hereafter.<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          &nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to point \r\n          out when some people speak of worldly gains, such as saying that prayer \r\n          involves physical exercise and calms the nerves, and that fasting cleanses \r\n          the body and disciplines eating habits, we should not make worldly gains \r\n          the main aim of worship, because that will lead to a weakening of sincerity \r\n          and negligence in seeking the Hereafter. Hence Allaah has explained \r\n          to us in His Book that the wisdom behind fasting, for example, is to \r\n          promote taqwa (piety). The religious benefits are the primary aim, and \r\n          worldly benefits are secondary. When we speak to the common people we \r\n          should tell them of the spiritual aspects, and when we speak to those \r\n          who cannot be convinced by anything other than materialistic considerations, \r\n          then we can tell them of both the spiritual and worldly benefits; it \r\n          is a matter of addressing each in the manner he understands best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen , Kitaab al-&lsquo;Ilm, p. 100"},{"id":"9883","question_id":"9883","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise be to \r\n          Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>There are two ways of acquiring knowledge:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>1 &ndash; Acquiring it from trustworthy books, \r\n          which have been written by scholars who are known for their knowledge \r\n          and trustworthiness and whose &lsquo;aqeedah (belief) is known to be free \r\n          of innovations (bid&rsquo;ah) and myths.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Taking knowledge from books can help \r\n          a person to reach a certain level, but there are two obstacles:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>The first obstacle is that this takes \r\n          a long time, because one needs a lot of time and a lot of painstaking \r\n          effort until he gets the knowledge he wants. Many people may not be \r\n          able to overcome this obstacle, especially when they see that those \r\n          around them have wasted their time without gaining anything, so they \r\n          get bored and tired, then they do not get what they want.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>The second obstacle is that the knowledge \r\n          of the person who acquires knowledge from books is usually weak, because \r\n          it is not built on a solid foundation. Hence we find many mistakes made \r\n          by those who take their knowledge from books, because they have no guidelines \r\n          or principles with which to deal with minor issues referred to in the \r\n          Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah. We find some people come across a hadeeth which \r\n          is not mentioned in the reliable books of Saheeh and Musnad, and this \r\n          method goes against the principles followed by the scholars and indeed \r\n          by the ummah, then they take this hadeeth and build their belief on \r\n          it. Undoubtedly this is wrong, because the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah have principles \r\n          around which the minor issues revolve, and if there is something that \r\n          contradicts these principles and cannot be reconciled with them, then \r\n          that should be abandoned.  <\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2 &ndash; One of the ways of gaining knowledge is to learn \r\n          from a scholar who is trustworthy with regard to his knowledge and his \r\n          religious commitment. This way is quicker and is more reliable, because \r\n          in the first method the seeker of knowledge may go astray without realizing \r\n          it, either because of misunderstanding or because he is lacking in knowledge, \r\n          or for some other reason. But in the second method he can discuss, give \r\n          and take with his teacher, which will open to the student many doors \r\n          to understanding and examining, how to defend the correct views and \r\n          refute weak views.&nbsp; The student should prioritize and read book \r\n          which summarize knowledge before studying it in depth. In this manner \r\n          he will progress gradually.

Because \r\n          knowing the terminology means that you will save a lot of time. This \r\n          is what the scholars do in the introduction to their books, for example \r\n          we know that when the author of <i>Buloogh al Maraam<\/i> says &ldquo;agreed \r\n          upon&rdquo;, he means that the hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, \r\n          whereas the author of <i>al-Muntaqaa<\/i> uses this phrase in a different \r\n          manner &ndash; when he says &ldquo;agreed upon&rdquo;, he means that the hadeeth was narrated \r\n          by Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari and Muslim.

This does \r\n          not involve the same level of thinking as the first method. The best \r\n          way to read books is to ponder the meanings and seek help from scholars \r\n          who have understanding. It comes as no surprise that the book which \r\n          is most deserving of such a reading is the Book of Allaah.

They may \r\n          quote things verbatim, or they may distort them to make them longer, \r\n          but it is all waffle. So you have to read the most important reference \r\n          works written by the salaf, because they are better and more blessed \r\n          than many of the books of the later generation. Most of the books of \r\n          the later writers are short on meanings but long-winded. You may read \r\n          a whole page which could have been summarized in one or two lines. But \r\n          you will find the books of the salaf to be easy, straightforward and \r\n          well written, with not even one word that has no meaning.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><b> \r\n          <span>Among the best books that the seeker \r\n          of knowledge must be keen to read are<\/span><\/b><span> \r\n          the books of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim \r\n          (may Allaah have mercy on them both). It is known that the books of \r\n          Ibn al-Qayyim are easier, because the style of Ibn Taymiyah is strongly-worded \r\n          because of his abundant knowledge and alert mind, and Ibn al-Qayyim \r\n          saw the knowledge of Ibn Taymiyah as a well-built house, and his own \r\n          role as that of organizing and adorning. But Ibn al-Qayyim was free \r\n          minded; if he thought that his shaykh&rsquo;s view differed from what he thought \r\n          was correct, he would speak up. When he thought that the pilgrim should \r\n          go out of ihraam for Hajj then re-enter ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah, because Ibn \r\n          &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) thought that if the person \r\n          who has not brought an animal for sacrifice enters ihraam for Hajj or \r\n          Qiraan, he must go out of ihraam for Hajj then enter ihraam for &lsquo;Umrah, \r\n          whereas Ibn Taymiyah thought that this applied only to the Sahaabah, \r\n          he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said, &ldquo;I am more inclined towards the opinion of \r\n          Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas than to the opinion of my shaykh.&rdquo; He clearly stated that \r\n          he was of a different view, so he was independent in his thinking. But \r\n          it comes as no surprise that he followed his shaykh (may Allaah have \r\n          mercy on him) in matters which he thought were true and correct. Undoubtedly \r\n          if you think about most of the opinions of Ibn Taymiyah you will find \r\n          that they are correct. This is something which anyone who ponders his \r\n          books will know.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><b> \r\n          <span>5 &ndash; Evaluating books<\/span><\/b><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Books may be divided into three types:<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>&nbsp;1 &ndash; Good books<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>2 &ndash; Bad books<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>3 &ndash; Books which are neither good nor \r\n          bad.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>&nbsp;Try to make sure that your bookshelf \r\n          is free of books which have bad content.

If you often review the names of hadeeth \r\n          narrators, then whenever you come across the name of one of the narrators \r\n          of al-Bukhaari in any isnaad, you will know that this is one of the \r\n          narrators of al-Bukhaari, so you will benefit from this knowledge of \r\n          hadeeth.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          3 &ndash; Books of fiqh:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span><i>Aadaab al-mashiy ila&rsquo;l-Salaah<\/i><\/span> \r\n          by Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy \r\n          on him)<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span><i>Zaad al-Mustaqni&rsquo; fi \r\n          Ikhtisaar al-Muqni&rsquo;<\/i><\/span> by al-Hajjaawi. \r\n          This is one of the best texts of fiqh.

So they have \r\n          to be regarded as <i>shaadhdh<\/i> and not saheeh, following this shar&rsquo;i \r\n          principle which is accepted by the scholars. What our brother &lsquo;Allaamah \r\n          Shaykh Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani has mentioned in his book \r\n          <i>Adaab al-Zafaaf<\/i>, reconciling these reports with the ahaadeeth \r\n          which permit (gold to women) by interpreting the prohibition as applying \r\n          to gold formed into circles and the permission as applying to other \r\n          kinds of jewellery, is not correct and is not in accordance with the \r\n          ahaadeeth which indicate that gold is permitted, because the ahaadeeth \r\n          permit rings, which are in the form of a circle, and they permit bangles, \r\n          which are in the form of a circle. So what we have mentioned becomes \r\n          clear. Moreover the ahaadeeth which indicate that gold is permitted \r\n          are general and are not restricted in meaning. So we must follow them \r\n          because they are general in meaning and because their isnaads are saheeh. \r\n          This is supported by the reports narrated by a group of the scholars \r\n          that there was consensus that the ahaadeeth which indicate that gold \r\n          is forbidden were abrogated, as we have quoted from them above. This \r\n          is the truth beyond a doubt. Hence confusion may be dispelled and the \r\n          ruling of sharee&rsquo;ah becomes clear: there is no doubt that gold is permitted \r\n          to the females of this ummah and is forbidden to the males. And Allaah \r\n          is the Source of strength. Praise be to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds, \r\n          and may Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and \r\n          his family and companions. <\/big>\r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source:"},{"id":"9899","question_id":"9899","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is obvious that your dreams illustrate a strong\r\n    desire to acquire the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah.

Some of those who hold official religious positions have lost respect \r\n    in people&rsquo;s eyes, and their views are no longer valued.

Al-Faatihah has to be learned by every accountable person, i.e., \r\n    he has to learn how to recite it properly. If he learns it by heart that is \r\n    good; if he does not learn it by heart then he must read it from the Mus-haf \r\n    or a piece of paper and the like.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said in <i>\r\n    al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (3\/335): Our companions said: If a person is not able to \r\n    recite al-Faatihah then he should acquire the ability to do so by learning \r\n    it, or acquire a Mus-haf from which he can read it, by buying it or renting \r\n    it or borrowing it. If he is praying at night or in the dark, then he must \r\n    acquire a lamp if he can. If he refuses to do that when he is able to do it, \r\n    then he is sinning and must repeat every prayer that he offered before he \r\n    learned al-Faatihah.

You should also \r\n    avoid time wasters such as means of entertainment like TV shows, soap \r\n    operas, newspapers, magazines, games, sports matches and competitions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The seeker of \r\n    knowledge must make the most of his time and avoid wasting time.

This \r\n    undoubtedly stems from a weakness of commitment to Islam, because the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Part of a person&rsquo;s \r\n    being a good Muslim is leaving alone that which does not concern him.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 2318; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.<\/span><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Focusing on \r\n    who said what and asking a lot of questions is a waste of time. In fact it \r\n    is a kind of sickness which if it affects a person &ndash; we ask Allah to keep us \r\n    safe and sound &ndash; will become his main focus and concern and he may end up \r\n    showing a hostile attitude towards one who does not deserve enmity, or he \r\n    may be friendly towards one who does not deserve friendship, because of his \r\n    interest in these matters that are distracting him from seeking knowledge, \r\n    on the grounds that this is part of supporting the truth. But that is not \r\n    the case; rather this comes under the heading of being distracted by that \r\n    which does not concern one. But if news comes to you without you seeking it \r\n    or looking for it, everyone receives news but you should not be preoccupied \r\n    with it or focus on it, because this causes distraction for the seeker of \r\n    knowledge and may confuse him, and it opens the door to partisanship and \r\n    division amongst the ummah.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Kitaab \r\n    al-&lsquo;Ilm<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    p. 143-144&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>(c)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Another matter \r\n    that is detrimental to the issue of organising one&rsquo;s time and making the \r\n    most of it is procrastination.

Our early generations (may Allah \r\n    have mercy on them) set an amazing example of making the most of their time. \r\n    All seekers of Qur&rsquo;anic knowledge were keen to study under Abu Na&lsquo;eem \r\n    al-Asfahaani (d. 430) and every day one of them would have his turn and he \r\n    would study whatever he wanted with the Shaykh until just before Zuhr. Then \r\n    when he got up to go home, another student might recite a juz&rsquo; to him on the \r\n    way (for him to listen and correct), and he never showed any impatience.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Saleem \r\n    ar-Raazi was a Shaafa&lsquo;i. One day he went home and came back, and he said: I \r\n    recited a juz&rsquo; on my way. Al-Haafiz adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on \r\n    him) said in his biography of al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi: The khateeb used to \r\n    walk with a juz&rsquo; in his hand, which he would study.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>For forty \r\n    years, Ibn &lsquo;Asaakir (may Allah have mercy on him) &ndash; as his son said &ndash; did \r\n    not focus on anything except matters of knowledge, even during his free time \r\n    or when he was alone. He always had with him books of knowledge and the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;an, which he would read and memorise. They were always keen to make the \r\n    most of their time by doing more than one thing at the same time. If the pen \r\n    became blunt and he needed to sharpen it, one of them would move his lips \r\n    with remembrance of Allah whilst fixing his pen, or he would review things \r\n    that he had memorised lest any time pass without him doing something \r\n    useful.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Abu&rsquo;l-Wafa&rsquo; \r\n    &lsquo;Ali ibn &lsquo;Aqeel (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not allow myself to \r\n    waste even one hour of my life; even when I am not reading anything or \r\n    reciting anything, I would think whilst I am resting of some issues of \r\n    knowledge and I will not get up until I have come up with something I can \r\n    write down.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ibn al-Qayyim \r\n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I know someone who fell sick with a \r\n    headache and fever, and his book was beside his head.

The best time for memorising &ndash; especially memorising \r\n    Qur&rsquo;an &ndash; is the time just before dawn and after Fajr prayer, when the mind \r\n    is clear and it is easier to memorise. So the seeker of knowledge prays in \r\n    the mosque and remains there until sunrise or afterwards, memorising and \r\n    reviewing what he has memorised. When he has finished that, he begins to \r\n    memorise texts of knowledge &ndash; the texts of hadeeth, fiqh, usool and Arabic \r\n    language.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>2.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If he has a \r\n    job or is in school, he goes to it. Otherwise he spends the rest of the \r\n    morning memorising and revising until Zuhr, then he takes a siesta and rests \r\n    a little.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>3.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>As for the \r\n    afternoon, it is for studying and reading, or studying with others, or \r\n    discussion and reviewing issues of knowledge with others.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>4.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>After Maghrib, \r\n    he attends study circles and after &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; he reviews what he has learnt or \r\n    he may read a new book.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It should be \r\n    noted that what we have mentioned here comes under the heading of organising \r\n    time in general terms. Each student should organise his time according to \r\n    his circumstances, whether he is working or not, whether he is married or \r\n    single, whether he devotes all his time to Islamic knowledge or he has some \r\n    other preoccupations, and so on. What matters with regard to organising time \r\n    is that there should be some hours of the day and night in which he makes \r\n    himself memorise and read. People tend to want to rest and like to be \r\n    somewhat lazy, so he should train himself to work hard and be active, and he \r\n    should make himself get used to being organised and adhere to doing acts of \r\n    worship and obedience. Otherwise he will have wasted his day and then he \r\n    will have wasted his life.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>For \r\n    information on how to seek knowledge, see the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]20191[\\fatin]<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>For \r\n    information on the etiquette of seeking knowledge, see the answer to \r\n    question no.

It is \r\n    extraordinary in its style and eloquence, and in what it foretold of future \r\n    events of the unseen, so that no era passed except something appeared that \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;an said would come to pass, which proves the truthfulness of its \r\n    claim. This is the strongest of the interpretations of the hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was also said that what is meant is that the miracles of \r\n    the past were visible and could be seen with the eyes, such as the she-camel \r\n    of Saalih and the staff of Moosa, whereas the miracle of the Qur&rsquo;an may be \r\n    comprehended with the intellect, so the number of those who followed the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of it \r\n    were more numerous, since that which can be seen with the eyes comes to an \r\n    end when the looking ends, whereas that which may be comprehended with the \r\n    intellect will continue to be understood by those who come after the first \r\n    generations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 9\/70&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer to the question, How can the Qur&rsquo;an be a miracle \r\n    for the unlettered non-Arabs who formed the majority of inhabitants of the \r\n    world at that time? is as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) was sent among the Arabs, who were distinguished by their great \r\n    eloquence and beautiful style in speech, so Allah, may He be exalted, made \r\n    the miracle or sign of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) of the same nature of that by which his people were distinguished, so \r\n    that the miracle and challenge would be more effective, just as the sign of \r\n    Moosa (peace be upon him) was his staff or stick, with which he overcame the \r\n    deceit of the sorcerers, and the sign of &lsquo;Eesa (peace be upon him) was the \r\n    healing of those who had been born blind and of the lepers, because \r\n    knowledge of medicine was widespread at his time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the non-Arabs, in the past and at present, and \r\n    how the Qur&rsquo;an may be a miracle for them, and whether they were included in \r\n    its challenge, this may be explained from several angles:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Not all Arabs have great knowledge of the Arabic language and \r\n    its style and eloquence, just as not all non-Arabs are ignorant of the \r\n    Arabic language. Hence it is known that the miracle and the challenge is \r\n    addressed to all those who know Arabic, whether they learned it from birth, \r\n    like the Arabs, or they learned it later on, like the non-Arabs. Thus it is \r\n    clear that the case of the non-Arabs is like that of Arabs who have no \r\n    knowledge of their language.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu &lsquo;Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is said: &ldquo;With regard to reviving the dead, turning the \r\n    staff into a snake and other, similar miracles, they are very clear and no \r\n    one who observes that will have any doubt about it. It will be clear to all \r\n    rational people and no doubt will remain; rather they will all reach a \r\n    definitive conclusion after seeing that. But this is not the case with \r\n    regard to your Prophet&rsquo;s claim of the miraculous nature of the Qur&rsquo;an, \r\n    because not everyone will be able to understand its miraculous nature; \r\n    rather it is only you (Arabs) who can see that, and this applies only to \r\n    those Arabs who have a good command of the language, as you claim. As for \r\n    those who do not have a good command of the language, or non-Arabs who do \r\n    not understand Arabic, they will not understand its miraculous nature. If a \r\n    non-Arab is asked to speak a word of Arabic, he will not be able to do so, \r\n    so the fact that he is not able to do that, does not prove that what you are \r\n    challenging him with is true. Similarly, if an Arab who does not have a good \r\n    command of Arabic is asked to speak proper Arabic, he will not be able to do \r\n    so; therefore for him the Qur&rsquo;an is not miraculous.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer to that is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We will explain, insha Allah, some aspects of its miraculous \r\n    nature, of which there are many, some of which can be understood by ordinary \r\n    people, town dwellers and desert dwellers alike, and these aspects are as \r\n    clear as turning the staff into a snake and raising the dead. If we assume, \r\n    for the sake of argument, that it is only miraculous with regard to its \r\n    eloquence and style, which is different to the style of the speech of \r\n    ordinary people, then we say that the miraculous nature of the Qur&rsquo;an, \r\n    raising the dead and turning the staff into a snake are not going to be \r\n    understood equally or at the same time by rational people. Rather the one \r\n    who appreciates the miraculous nature of any miracle is the one who knows \r\n    how and why that thing is a miracle, as he knows that it is something that \r\n    cannot be achieved by human tricks and cannot be reached by discovering some \r\n    material with special characteristics.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may not be far-fetched to say that a specious argument may \r\n    be developed in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine or magic, which \r\n    prevents him from seeing the miracle; therefore he may say: Perhaps Moosa \r\n    had some extra knowledge of magic that the sorcerers did not know and had \r\n    never learned, and by the same token, perhaps &lsquo;Eesa had found some stones \r\n    with special qualities or some other material with special qualities by \r\n    means of which he was able to achieve what he achieved. Such a specious \r\n    argument can only develop in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine and \r\n    magic. As for the one who has any knowledge of medicine or magic, no such \r\n    confusion will arise in his mind, because he realises, on the basis of his \r\n    knowledge and experience, that the miracle performed by a prophet is \r\n    something that cannot be achieved by means of professional tricks or finding \r\n    some materials with special characteristics; rather it is a miracle that \r\n    happens by the will of the Creator of the universe, by means of which He \r\n    intended to give proof of the authenticity of the one who called people to \r\n    Him. Thus we conclude that understanding of the miraculous nature of raising \r\n    the dead and turning the staff into a snake was first reached by the \r\n    sorcerers and magicians, and it may not have been understood by many of the \r\n    fools who were ignorant of medicine and magic. The same may be said of the \r\n    miraculous nature of the Qur&rsquo;an, without any differences: understanding of \r\n    it came to those who had knowledge of the Arabic language and would see, \r\n    based on their knowledge of Arabic, the difference between the Qur&rsquo;an and \r\n    regular Arabic speech. Thus they would conclude that it was not within the \r\n    ability of the Arabs to say things in the same style. If the eloquent Arabs \r\n    and those who were well versed in Arabic were unable to match it, then \r\n    others are more unlikely to be able to do so. As we say, if the doctors are \r\n    unable to raise the dead and heal those who were born blind and lepers, \r\n    people other than doctors are more unlikely to be able to do so; and if the \r\n    sorcerers were unable to turn a stick into a snake, then people other than \r\n    sorcerers are more unlikely to be able to do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The statement that matching the Qur&rsquo;an is something that the \r\n    Arabs are not able to do, and non-Arabs are not involved in this challenge, \r\n    is similar to saying that only doctors are unable to raise the dead, and \r\n    people other than doctors are not involved in this challenge, or saying that \r\n    only sorcerers are unable to turn a stick into a snake, and people other \r\n    than sorcerers are not involved in this challenge. As the challenge in the \r\n    other two cases (raising the dead and turning the stick into a snake) is \r\n    expected to be undertaken by those who have the relevant skills, the same \r\n    applies in the case of the Qur&rsquo;an. Rather, in the case of the Qur&rsquo;anic \r\n    miracle, it has aspects that we will discuss which everyone can understand, \r\n    whether he is a non-Arab or an Arab, a Magian or a Jew or Christian. We will \r\n    discuss it below, in sha Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So we may conclude from what we have said that Muhammad \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought the Qur&rsquo;an, challenged \r\n    people with it and it is a miracle, and anyone who brings a miracle and \r\n    challenges others with it is truthful. Therefore the certain conclusion is \r\n    that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is true.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-I&lsquo;laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam<\/i>, p. 326&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars said that the miracle in the Book of \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, is not only in the wording, but also the meanings, \r\n    the sequence of meanings and the way in which ideas are presented. So the \r\n    miracle and challenge for the Arabs has to do with the style, and for others \r\n    it has to do with the fact that no one among the speakers of any other \r\n    language is able to come up with something similar to the Qur&rsquo;an in any \r\n    other language.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Jassaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words of Allah, may He be exalted, (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): &ldquo;<i><span>Say: &lsquo;If mankind and \r\n    the jinns were together to produce the like of this Qur&rsquo;an, they could not \r\n    produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another&rsquo;<\/span>&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Isra&rsquo; 17:88]<\/i> prove the miraculous nature of \r\n    the Qur&rsquo;an. Some people say that its miracle is in the wording and style on \r\n    the one hand, and in the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \r\n    presented, on the other hand. They quote as evidence for that the fact that \r\n    in this verse the Qur&rsquo;an challenges both the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the \r\n    jinn and humans. It is well-known that the non-Arabs could not be challenged \r\n    on the aspect of the wording and style, therefore the challenge for them \r\n    should have to do with the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \r\n    presented.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars insist that its miraculous nature is \r\n    limited to its style and eloquence of expression. They say: The miraculous \r\n    nature of the Qur&rsquo;an has many aspects: its beautiful style, its eloquent and \r\n    concise wording, the way in which it combines many meanings in few words, in \r\n    addition to the fact that it is completely free of any words that sound \r\n    ineloquent or any ideas or meanings that are out of place, as well as being \r\n    free of any contradictions. All of it, from beginning to end, is consistent, \r\n    as described above. The words of people, on the other hand, especially if \r\n    they speak at length, cannot be free of cheap words, corrupt meanings and \r\n    contradictions. What we have mentioned of the flaws in people&rsquo;s speech are \r\n    present in the speech of people of all languages; it does not apply only to \r\n    those who speak Arabic. Thus it is possible that the challenge of the Qur&rsquo;an \r\n    may be applicable to the non-Arabs in that way: challenging them to bring \r\n    something that is free of the faults and flaws referred to above, because \r\n    saying things in an eloquent manner is not something that is limited only to \r\n    Arabic, to the exclusion of other languages, even though the Arabic language \r\n    is the most eloquent. We know that the Qur&rsquo;an is the pinnacle of eloquence, \r\n    so it is possible that the challenge to the non-Arabs is by way of \r\n    challenging them to produce words at the highest level of eloquence in their \r\n    own languages.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Ahkaam al-Qur&rsquo;an<\/i>, 5\/34, 35&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are many aspects to the miraculous nature of the Book \r\n    of Allah; it is not limited to style and eloquence only. Hence some of the \r\n    scholars said that the miraculous nature of the Book of Allah which all \r\n    people, not only the Arabs, may understand, and that Allah&rsquo;s challenge to \r\n    produce something like it, is only applicable to these aspects. Hence Allah \r\n    issued this challenge to the jinn as well as to mankind, to produce \r\n    something like this Qur&rsquo;an. One of these aspects is that it foretold events \r\n    that would happen and foretold the time at which they would happen, for \r\n    example.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu &lsquo;Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; The third aspect of the miraculous nature of the Qur&rsquo;an is \r\n    what it includes of news of the future before any human even knew anything \r\n    about it, and foretelling events before they happened. This is something \r\n    that cannot be known except via the truthful ones who are conveying from \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted. We will refer to some events just to prove this \r\n    point in brief, with no need for a lengthy discussion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example, Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation \r\n    of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>Certainly, you \r\n    shall enter Al-Masjid al-Haram; if Allah wills, secure, (some) having your \r\n    heads shaved, and (some) having your hair cut short, having no fear<\/span>&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Muhammad 47:27]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This verse is one of the clearest miracles of the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, \r\n    promised him that He would cause him to enter al-Masjid al-Haraam, him and \r\n    his people, in safety, and that He would grant them the conquest of Makkah \r\n    in the best state. They kept waiting for that until its time came and Allah \r\n    fulfilled His promise. Then they entered it as He had promised, and \r\n    conquered it as they had been foretold.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-I&lsquo;laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam<\/i>, p. 337&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are other opinions too, but what we have quoted above \r\n    is sufficient, and it is the strongest view concerning this matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) was an Arab and the Qur&rsquo;an is Arabic. He was sent to eloquent, \r\n    well-spoken Arabs, hence his greatest miracle was the Book of Allah, may He \r\n    be exalted. They were unable to match its wording, phrases, style and \r\n    eloquence. Thus the rational people among the eloquent and well-spoken \r\n    realised that this was not the words of a human being, hence they believed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for those Arabs who were not eloquent or well spoken, and \r\n    the non-Arabs, what is to be mentioned to them is the meanings and rulings \r\n    of the Qur&rsquo;an, and those aspects of its miraculous nature that they are able \r\n    to understand. Thus they may develop conviction based on the knowledge and \r\n    understanding that this is not the words of a human being. Hence many of the \r\n    non-Arabs became Muslim because of coming across the meaning of a verse. In \r\n    such cases, this non-Arab could not understand its eloquence and style, but \r\n    its meaning is the reason why he became Muslim. Many such stories have been \r\n    passed down by numerous narrators, and in our own time there are many more. \r\n    Those people only became Muslim after they learned what there is in these \r\n    verses that no human being could have produced, and that at the time of the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was no technology \r\n    and no scientific discoveries that could enable him to tell people about \r\n    these matters. Thus they accepted that this was revelation from heaven, so \r\n    they became Muslim. Hence we can see the extent to which the hadeeth the \r\n    questioner referred to is applicable to real facts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"9919","question_id":"9919","answers":"Praise be to Allah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Allah, may He be \r\n    exalted, has given authority in the matter of marriage to the man, so it is \r\n    not permissible for a woman to arrange a marriage for herself or for anyone \r\n    else; rather her marriage must be arranged by a wali or guardian.

In \r\n    fact it is an interest-based loan, and the scholars are unanimously agreed \r\n    that every loan that brings a benefit is riba (usury). The lender here is \r\n    the customer, and the borrower is the institution that provides these \r\n    accounts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Every loan \r\n    in which it is stipulated that more should be paid back is haraam, with no \r\n    difference of scholarly opinion. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They are unanimously \r\n    agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay back more or \r\n    give a gift, and he gives the loan on that basis, then this extra payment is \r\n    riba. It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood \r\n    forbade loans that bring benefits. (6\/436).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; The Post office puts the money received into riba-based \r\n    banks, and takes a set percentage for it, part of which it distributes as a \r\n    reward to the depositors. This is another riba-based transaction that is \r\n    done by the post office.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The post office borrows money with riba in the first case, \r\n    and it lends money with riba in the second case. Hence the one who examines \r\n    these transactions will have no doubt that they are haraam, and it is haraam \r\n    to work in them whether as a scribe or witness or helping with it in any \r\n    way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In <i>Mawsoo&rsquo;at Fataawa al-Azhar<\/i>, there is a question \r\n    addressed to the former Shaykh of al-Azhar, Jaad al-Haqq &lsquo;Ali Jaad al-Haqq \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him)&nbsp; about the interest that is paid by banks or \r\n    companies on the money that is deposited or invested with them &ndash; is this \r\n    interest regarded as riba (usury) or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After mentioning the texts which forbid riba, he said: Based \r\n    on these texts and others in the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, all types and forms of \r\n    riba are forbidden, whether it is additional to the amount that was \r\n    originally lent, or an additional amount charged when payment is delayed, or \r\n    this additional amount is stipulated in the contract along with a guarantee \r\n    that the capital will remain intact. As that is the case, then the interest \r\n    asked about, which is mentioned in the contract when depositing money in the \r\n    bank, and in savings funds at the post office and banks, and in investment \r\n    certificates which stipulate a specific return on the capital &ndash;&nbsp; the deposit \r\n    in such cases is a loan with interest, and comes under the heading of riba \r\n    al-fadl or riba al-ziyaadah, as the fuqaha&rsquo; call it. It is haraam in Islam, \r\n    based on the general meaning of the verses in the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan and the texts \r\n    of the Sunnah, and the consensus of the Muslims. It is not permissible&nbsp; for \r\n    a Muslim to deal in it or lend such loans, because he is responsible before \r\n    Allaah for his wealth, from where he acquires it and on what he spends it, \r\n    as it says in the hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi: &ldquo;A \r\n    person&rsquo;s feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection until he is asked \r\n    about his life and how he spent it, about his actions and what he did, and \r\n    about his wealth, from where he acquired it and on what he spent it, and \r\n    about his body, how he used it.&rdquo; And Allaah, may He be glorified and \r\n    exalted, knows best.

If it is the former, then the money that is coming \r\n    to you is halaal and there is no doubt that it is permissible. But if it is \r\n    the latter, then it is not permissible for you to take it, whether it is for \r\n    yourself or your husband, rather you must return it to the place that \r\n    transferred it to you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It should be understood \r\n    that between you and the state that appointed you to this job there is a \r\n    work contract, and this is what you must adhere to so long as it does not \r\n    involve going against the laws of Allaah, may He be exalted. One of the \r\n    implications of such contracts is that the worker takes a salary in return \r\n    for his work. If he refuses to work then his salary ceases, unless the \r\n    reason is an action on the part of the department, ministry or boss. It may \r\n    be that the clauses of the contract state that the salary will continue to \r\n    be deposited in the employee&rsquo;s account until matters are sorted out.

It is not permissible for a person to come to work late, or to leave \r\n    early. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The questioner said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But some of them say that \r\n    they don&rsquo;t have any work at all because there is not much work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Shaykh said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What matters is the time, \r\n    not the work, i.e. you are told that this salary is in return for being \r\n    present from this time until this time, whether there is any work or not.

When I asked one of them he said to me: Your \r\n    turn has not come yet. Then when that period ended, my colleagues and I were \r\n    paid for that work. I am confused &ndash; is this money halaal or haraam? Please \r\n    note that my boss and the head of the department were pleased with my work \r\n    and they regard me as a good employee, and this money may be a reward for my \r\n    keenness and good work, because my salary is low.

I ask you now: is this true or false? i.e., if a person got paid for \r\n    a certain task, did he do the job or not? If he did not do the job, then he \r\n    has taken this money unlawfully, and taking money unlawfully comes under the \r\n    heading of consuming wealth unlawfully, as well as being a betrayal of the \r\n    trust, and if the boss agreed to this action then he is also betraying the \r\n    trust. The money is not his, even if he disposes of it as he wishes; the \r\n    money belongs to the state and I think that the one who is asking this \r\n    question has repented from what he has done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i> \r\n    (114\/ question no. 15).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Shaykh (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was also asked: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I was working in the \r\n    administration of a town that is 75 km from my home via a desert road. When \r\n    I commuted this distance I found it hard, so I said to the boss: Let me come \r\n    two days a week.

If you did the work in full then you are entitled to \r\n    payment in full, but if you fell short then you are not entitled to full \r\n    payment. If you have taken the salary in full without any deduction, then \r\n    you must return it to the one from whom you took it, if you can. If you are \r\n    afraid of being asked questions, then give it in charity in order to get rid \r\n    of it, or give it to the mosque, or to repair roads, so that you will be \r\n    free of sin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The questioner said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I asked for permission from \r\n    the same official.

Allaah said to His Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;so be \r\n    not a pleader for the treacherous&rdquo; [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:105]<\/i>. We all know that if \r\n    the case is a just one and he does not use any kind of lying or perjury, \r\n    then there is nothing wrong with that, especially if the person is weak and \r\n    cannot defend himself or establish his claim to what is his right. \r\n    Appointing someone who is stronger than him to represent him is permitted in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;But if the \r\n    debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable to dictate for \r\n    himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:282]<\/i>. \r\n    Acting on behalf of a weak person in order to ensure that he gets what is \r\n    rightfully his or to ward off wrongdoing from him is a good thing. But if it \r\n    is other than that, i.e., helping a person who is in the wrong or defending \r\n    wrongdoing or using false evidence, and the deputy or representative knows \r\n    that the case is basically wrong, such as representing a person with regard \r\n    to something haraam such as riba, then it is not permissible. It is not \r\n    permissible for a Muslim to act as a deputy or representative with regard to \r\n    falsehood or to act as a lawyer in transactions that involve riba, because \r\n    then he is helping in the consumption of riba and so the curse applies to \r\n    him.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Fawzaan<\/i> \r\n    (3\/288, 289).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that you live in a country that is not ruled in \r\n    accordance with that which Allaah has revealed and is rather ruled by \r\n    man-made laws, does not mean that it is haraam to work as a lawyer if the \r\n    intention is to attain rights and ward off wrongs. The person who has been \r\n    wronged is compelled by necessity to refer to these laws in order to attain \r\n    his rights, otherwise people would wrong one another with impunity and chaos \r\n    would overtake the society. But if the law gives him more than he is \r\n    entitled to, then it is haraam for him to take it. He should only take what \r\n    he is entitled to. If he refers for judgement to these laws in order to \r\n    attain his rights and ward off wrongdoing, there is no sin on the one who \r\n    has been wronged or on the lawyer who represents him in a dispute by \r\n    referring to these laws for judgement. Rather the sin falls on the one who \r\n    replaced the laws of Allaah with these laws and forced the people to refer \r\n    to them for judgement.

Carrying suitcases is basically permissible work, but the fact \r\n    that you know there is alcohol in them makes carrying them haraam, and in \r\n    fact it is a major sin. Abu Dawood (3674) narrated that the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Allaah cursed \r\n    alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, \r\n    the one who buys it, the one who squeezes it (the grapes etc), the one for \r\n    whom it is squeezed, <b><u>the one who carries it<\/u><\/b> and the one to \r\n    whom it is carried.&rdquo; Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>al-Irwa&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n    (2385).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to baksheesh, one of the following three \r\n    scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; either there is an agreement between you and your boss \r\n    that the baksheesh belongs to you, in which case there is nothing wrong with \r\n    you taking it;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; or it is customary among people in such jobs that the \r\n    baksheesh belongs to you and the boss knows that and approves of it, so \r\n    there is nothing wrong with you taking it;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; or there is no agreement between you concerning baksheesh \r\n    and the giving baksheesh is not customary in a job such as yours, and you do \r\n    not know how the boss would react if he knew that you are keeping the \r\n    baksheesh for yourself, or you know that his reaction would not be in your \r\n    favour and he would not approve of that. In this case the baksheesh is what \r\n    is known as the &ldquo;agents&rsquo; gift&rdquo; and it is haraam and it is not permissible \r\n    for you to take it, because of the hadeeth of Abu Humayd al-Saa&rsquo;idi, which \r\n    says that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    employed a man called Ibn al-Latbiyyah to collect the zakaah. He came and \r\n    said: This is for you, and this was given to me. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up on the minbar and praised and \r\n    glorified Allaah, and said: &ldquo;What is the matter with an agent whom I send, \r\n    and he comes and says, &lsquo;This is for you and this was given to me&rsquo;? Why \r\n    doesn&rsquo;t he sit in the house of his mother and father, and see if he is given \r\n    anything or not? No one of you brings any such thing but he will bring it on \r\n    the Day of Resurrection, whether it is a camel or a cow or a sheep.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2457) and Muslim (1832).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the job itself &ndash; should you carry on with it \r\n    or leave it? Working in a hotel to which foreign tourists come is not haraam \r\n    in and of itself, but if it involves some haraam actions then it becomes \r\n    haraam. Such hotels are not free of alcohol, haraam mixing, music and \r\n    swimming pools, etc. This is what you refer to in your question by the &ldquo;free \r\n    atmosphere&rdquo; which exists in the hotel. This is what makes working in this \r\n    hotel and others like it haraam. You also say that you carry suitcases for \r\n    customers in which there may be alcohol, which also supports the view that \r\n    your working in this hotel is not permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, you should hasten to leave this job and find a \r\n    job in which your mind will be at ease about the salary that you earn.

In this game &lsquo;awrahs are \r\n    uncovered, prayers are missed, fitnah and desires are provoked, and there is \r\n    the possibility of harm and injury, as well as the negligence of acts of \r\n    worship that is involved.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Playing \r\n    football nowadays is accompanied by reprehensible things which mean that \r\n    playing it should be disallowed. These things may be summed up as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; It is \r\n    proven to us that play continues during the times of prayer, which results \r\n    in the players and spectators missing prayers or prayers in congregation, or \r\n    they delay performing prayers until the time for them is over. Undoubtedly \r\n    any action that interferes with performance of prayers on time or leads to \r\n    missing prayers in congregation with no valid shar&rsquo;i excuse is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The \r\n    nature of this game leads to factionalism, stirring up fitnah and hatred. \r\n    These results are the opposite of what Islam promotes of tolerance, \r\n    friendship and brotherhood, and cleaning hearts and souls of hatred, \r\n    resentment and grudges.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; The game \r\n    involves physical danger for the players as a result of collisions and \r\n    injuries. Usually the players do not end the game without some of them \r\n    falling on the pitch unconscious or with broken arms or legs. Nothing is \r\n    more indicative of that than the fact that there must always be an ambulance \r\n    present throughout the game.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The \r\n    purpose behind allowing sports is to make people become physically active \r\n    and to train them for fighting and to ward off chronic disease. But playing \r\n    football nowadays has no such aim. As well as the things mentioned above, it \r\n    is now also taking people&rsquo;s money for false purposes, let alone the danger \r\n    of physical injury and the generation of hatred in the hearts of players and \r\n    spectators, and the stirring up of fitnah. It has even gone so far that some \r\n    spectators attack some players, which could go as far as murder, as happened \r\n    in a match a few months ago. This alone is sufficient reason to disallow it. \r\n    And Allaah is the source of strength.

In all cases it is \r\n    essential that there be no harm caused to bodies or minds, and that it does \r\n    not lead to the grudges and hatred that usually occur between players, and \r\n    that it does not distract them from things that are more important, and that \r\n    it does not prevent them from remembrance of Allaah (dhikr) or prayer.

If he cannot do that except by \r\n    committing a haraam action, it is permissible for him to do it in that \r\n    case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on the above, you should strive to do the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Look for a gas mask that can be worn with a beard. Some \r\n    companies have made gas masks for religiously-committed Jews with beards who \r\n    work for airline companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Look for another job which does not require you to commit \r\n    any haraam actions, even if that job is in another country.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; Try to create your own work by doing business and the \r\n    like.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you cannot do any of these things, then there is no sin on \r\n    you, in sha Allaah, if you shave your beard, so long as you shorten it only \r\n    as much as is necessary; if you can manage to simply shorten it, then it not \r\n    permissible for you to shave it off, and so on. Undoubtedly if a person \r\n    fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him as much as he can, Allaah will \r\n    suffice him and grant him a way out, as Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He \r\n    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>3.&nbsp;And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \r\n    imagine&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid."},{"id":"9963","question_id":"9963","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to reward you with good for your desire to \r\n    treat your wife&rsquo;s mother kindly and to bring your wife close to her family, \r\n    and for the travelling, moving and giving up work that you are putting up \r\n    with for this purpose.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What you have done &ndash; signing for the days when you are absent \r\n    from work &ndash; is undoubtedly a haraam action, because it involves lying and \r\n    consuming people&rsquo;s wealth unlawfully.

Remember that that \r\n    which is with Allaah can only be attained by obeying Him, and that haraam \r\n    wealth erases blessings and will bring evil consqeuences in this world and \r\n    in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This advice was offered by Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) to the one who was careless about his attendance at work, and \r\n    was not honest in recording the times when he was present. He (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;It is a duty for every Muslim to fulfil his trusts \r\n    and to beware of cheating at work with regard to attendance and absence and \r\n    in all matters.

But \r\n    if it is a government company then that is not permitted, even if your boss \r\n    at work gives permission, because he does not own those things himself, so \r\n    how can he give them to someone else?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to using the computer to listen to lectures \r\n    and Qur&rsquo;aan, especially if that involves using the internet etc, which \r\n    incurs costs for the company.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even if it does not incur costs for the company, it is still \r\n    a dubious area, because it still involves wear and tear on the computer for \r\n    purposes other than work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point is that it is not permissible to do such things, \r\n    and you have to repent to Allaah and pay back whatever you have used up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you used papers for photocopying, then you have to give \r\n    back similar papers.

He \r\n    replied: Using government cars and other equipment that belongs to the \r\n    state, such as photocopiers, printers, etc for personal purposes is not \r\n    permissible, because these things are for the public interest and if a \r\n    person uses them for his own personal needs, this is a kind of aggression \r\n    against all the people. If something belongs to the Muslims as a whole, it \r\n    is not permissible for one person to use it for himself. The evidence for \r\n    that is the fact that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) forbade ghulool, i.e., a person taking something from the \r\n    war-booty for himself, because this (the war-booty) is public property. If a \r\n    person sees someone using government equipment or cars for his own purposes \r\n    he should advise him and explain to him that this is haraam. If Allaah \r\n    guides him, then this is the desired outcome; if not, then he should report \r\n    him, because that is a kind of cooperating in piety and righteousness. And \r\n    it was proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Support your brother whether he is a oppressor or oppressed.&rdquo; \r\n    They said: O Messenger of Allaah, (we know how to help) if he is oppressed, \r\n    but how (can we help him) if he is an oppressor?

Hence the one \r\n    who did it and the one who approved of it were both punished for sin, so \r\n    they are all doomed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The similarity between the two does not apply in all aspects, \r\n    but they may appear to be partners in the sin, because a person is \r\n    influenced by his companion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover there is the fear that if a person works in such \r\n    places his faith will become weak and he will lose any sense of gheerah \r\n    (protective jealousy, pride).

Some may be haraam because of things in the work-place that are \r\n    contrary to sharee&rsquo;ah, such as mixing between men and women, or because it \r\n    is stipulated that one should wear haraam clothing or do other things that \r\n    are contrary to sharee&rsquo;ah, such as shaving the beard. It is not permissible \r\n    for the Muslim to do either type of job.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Jobs of the second type \r\n    vary in the degree to which they are haraam. The one which incurs the \r\n    greatest burden of sin is that which involves writing down or recording riba \r\n    (usury), then that which involves selling or manufacturing haraam things, \r\n    then that in which the workplace environment is haraam. The last category \r\n    should not be taken lightly, because it has an impact on the religious \r\n    commitment and conduct of the worker, especially the fitnah of women which \r\n    was the first fitnah of the Children of Israel and is the most harmful \r\n    fitnah for the Muslim man, as our Prophet Muhammad <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) told us.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If mixing between men and \r\n    women is something that happens in your country and you can hardly find any \r\n    job that is free of that, and you think that your being in that job will be \r\n    beneficial and that you will be able to put a stop to some of that evil and \r\n    reduce some of it, and you will be able to advise the employees who are \r\n    under your authority, enjoining them to do what is good and forbidding them \r\n    to do what is evil as much as you can, and you can take precautions and \r\n    measure which will help you avoid the fitnah of women &ndash; such as hastening to \r\n    get married if you are not married, not looking at them or being alone with \r\n    them &ndash; and if the work requires you to sit with some of the female employees \r\n    you can leave the door of the office open and not sit close to them and so \r\n    on &hellip; <\/p>\r\n    <p>&hellip; then we think that your \r\n    being present in the workplace and achieving some of the interests of \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah and reducing some evils, is better than keeping the workplace \r\n    devoid of the righteous and leaving it to those who do not pay any attention \r\n    to religion or to the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah, so that these evils become more \r\n    widespread and it becomes more difficult to fight them. How many teachers \r\n    and university professors have taught in mixed institutions and Allaah has \r\n    benefited many through them, and warded off a great deal of evil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We hope by Allaah&rsquo;s grace \r\n    that you will be one of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>However, if you think, \r\n    after taking the job, that you cannot adhere to your religious commitment \r\n    and that you are being pulled into haraam gradually, then you have no choice \r\n    but to leave that job immediately. If a person gives up something for the \r\n    sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it, as \r\n    the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the ways in \r\n    which the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) earned their living, \r\n    there were many ways, including: <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Trade, as in the case of Abu \r\n    Bakr al-Siddeeq, &lsquo;Uthmaan ibn &lsquo;Affaan and &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him)<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Agriculture, whether they owned \r\n    farmland or worked on the land; many of the Muhaajireen and Ansaar were \r\n    involved in this<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Skilled crafts, such as \r\n    smithery, carpentry and so on<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Jobs that were connected to the \r\n    state, such as teaching, collecting zakaah, judging and so on<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Earnings acquired through \r\n    jihad, such as war booty<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But there is a great \r\n    difference between the nature of life, professions and handicrafts at that \r\n    time, and these things as they are nowadays. But every era is different, as \r\n    they say.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) preferring trade to \r\n    handicrafts, there is no proof for that, as far as we know. There is a \r\n    difference of opinion among the scholars concerning this issue. Some of them \r\n    are of the view that business is preferable, and others say that agriculture \r\n    is preferable, whilst a third group prefers working with one's hands to earn \r\n    a living, such as handicrafts and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There is a hadeeth \r\n    concerning the virtue of working in trade, but it is not proven. It is the \r\n    report which says that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;Nine-tenths of provision is in trade.&rdquo; See <i>al-Silsilah \r\n    al-Da&rsquo;eefah<\/i> (3402).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the report \r\n    which speaks of the virtue of manufacturing or handicrafts and trade, it was \r\n    narrated that Raafi&rsquo; ibn Khadeej (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: It \r\n    was said: O Messenger of Allaah, what kind of earning is best? He said: &ldquo;For \r\n    a man to work with his hands and every honest transaction.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    Ahmad (17265); classed as hasan by the commentators on <i>al-Musnad<\/i>; \r\n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb<\/i> (1691).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated from \r\n    al-Miqdaam (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No one ever eats \r\n    anything better than that which he earned with his own hands. The Prophet of \r\n    Allaah Dawood (peace be upon him) used to eat that which he earned with his \r\n    own hands.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1966).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The scholars differed as to \r\n    the best type of work. Al-Mawardi said: The basic types of earning a living \r\n    are: agriculture, trade and manufacturing. The most likely view of \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i is that the best of them is trade. He said: The most correct in \r\n    my view is that the best of them is agriculture, because it is the closest \r\n    to tawakkul (putting one&rsquo;s trust in Allaah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi followed it with \r\n    the hadeeth of al-Miqdaam (quoted above) and said that the correct view is \r\n    that the best way of earning a living is by working with one&rsquo;s hands. If it \r\n    is also in agriculture, then that is the best way of earning a living, \r\n    because it involves both working with one&rsquo;s hands and putting one&rsquo;s trust in \r\n    Allaah, and it benefits both humans and animals, and because usually some of \r\n    it is given for free. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I say: Superior to that in \r\n    things that are done using one's hands is what one acquires of the wealth of \r\n    the kuffaar through jihad. This is how the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) and the companions earned wealth and it is the \r\n    noblest way of acquiring wealth, because it is making the word of Allaah \r\n    supreme, suppressing the word of His enemies, and brings benefit in the \r\n    Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He said: If a person does \r\n    not work with his hands, then agriculture is best for him, for the reasons \r\n    we mentioned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>I say: This is based on the \r\n    fact that the benefit of agriculture is not limited to the one who practices \r\n    it. However, that does not apply only to agriculture, rather anything that \r\n    one does with one&rsquo;s hands is going to benefit others, because this involves \r\n    producing things that people need. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In fact that varies \r\n    according to circumstances and according to individual cases. And Allaah \r\n    knows best. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Fath al-Baari<\/i> \r\n    (4\/304).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on this, agriculture \r\n    may be better for one who is more skilled in it than other fields, and \r\n    manufacturing may be better for one person than for others, and a third \r\n    person may be better at trading so that is better for him than for others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So each person should see \r\n    what kind of work is suitable for him and what he is best at, and strive to \r\n    benefit himself and the Muslims through this work.
