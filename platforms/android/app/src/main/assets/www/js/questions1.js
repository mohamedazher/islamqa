But I have some misunderstandings about these two verses. \"So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)\"! (Sura Maryam 33). The day that I die; what does this mean? And also this verse: And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them;- (An-Nisa 159). Before his death; what does this mean? But this verse: \"That they said (in boast), \"We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah\";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- (An-Nisa 157) \" Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise;- (An-Nisa 158).

Hence I have no choice but to buy hijab through the Internet, and I need to use their credit cards in order to make the purchase. I am also studying in a Christian school and I need their help to change schools, as I cannot do that myself. They do not let me leave the house on my own, hence I need them to take me to the mosque&hellip; and so on. Because they do not agree, this means that I am not able to follow the deen completely.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey also force me to do things that are contrary to Islam, such as going to the church, dancing, and wearing clothes that leave my arms, legs and head partially or completely naked.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI am worried about this situation, because the Qur'aan enjoins us to obey and to respect our parents and treat them kindly, but it does not show any compromise when it has to do with those who hate Islam. I do not know what to do. If I obey my parents, I will be doing a lot of things that are contrary to Islam. If I respect them, I will be respecting people who do not respect me as a Muslim, and I will be leaving them to say those terrible things about Islam. But if I do not obey them and respect them, then I will be doing something terrible from an Islamic point of view. I believe that both actions are wrong. What should I do?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMay Allah bless you.","question_url":"\/en\/136360","question_no":"136360","status":"done"},{"id":"801","category_id":"234","question":"Ruling on a Muslim bequeathing money for building a church.","question_full":"I heard a fatwa from one of the shaykhs saying that it is permissible for a Muslim to leave instructions in his will that a church be built with his money after he dies and that this is not a sin.

I have read in an antiislamic website run by a christian theologist from England that the scholar \"Al-Sagistany\" wrote in his book called \"Almasahif\" that the Muslim leader \"Al-Hajjajj \" changed letters in the Quran in about at least ten words .  He claims that \"Alsagistany\" reported this and that he wrote it under the title:  \"Ma Ghayarraho Alhajjajj Fe Moshaf Othman\". this christian also narrates in Arabic what he claims to be a copy of this page with the ten words which he claims had letters changed in them.  \r\n\r\nI have tried to find a copy of that book to search the matter but I failed.  Please try your best efforts to make this matter clear . Also  it is unimaginable to me that the whole Muslim scholars and memorizers of Quran could have just accepted someone to change in the Quran without stopping this or not knowing about it. Even if  Alsagistany really reported this, it still really doesnot make sense at all; first of all because we are not like christians and jews who dont memorize their books totally and it is mainly left to religious scholars. Instead  very large numbers of muslims  memorize the Quran and almost all read it . So changes could not have just passed unnoticed except by Alsagistany especially that at this era there were already several total copies of the Quran in all muslim countries.  Secondly, if it is very difficult to believe that these changes were not noticed by scholars or people at the time, then it is far more difficult to imagine that any muslim scholar or even lay man would know of the changes to the  book of Allah and keep quiet and  not fight this thing and just accept it.  Sir, it just could not happen.\r\n\r\nSo please try to find this book and clarify the matter for me in great detail with definite evidence and proofs as much as Allah will help you. I appreciate your cooperation and again forgive me for my long letter but I cannot tell you how important this matter is to me.

In its end a situation was mentioned: Al-laalkaa&rsquo;e narrated that when a man mentioned A&rsquo;yesha, may Allah be pleased with her, in a bad manner in Al-hasan ben zaid&rsquo;s presence, he ordered to kill this man by sword. The Alwiyyoun said: he is one of our group. So Al-hasan said: &ldquo;we seek refuge with Allah from this, this man slandered the prophet, peace be upon him. Allah Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women) such are innocent of that which people say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSo if A&rsquo;yesha may Allah be pleased with her is a bad woman then the prophet, peace be upon him is also bad. Thus, this man is infidel; kill him by sword, so they killed him. &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat is the explanation of this verse &ldquo;Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women) such are innocent of that which people say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI had a personal experiment myself; I married a girl who I though is religious, my aim was to establish a righteous Muslim home in which I try my best to follow the approach of our honourable prophet, peace be upon him, and his companions. In brief, I did not ask about her very well before marriage, I found her to be very vile. May Allah forgive her and me. Most of her talk was lies and tricks. I did not feel she has any passion for Islam or for righteousness. I divorced her after I knew she is not going to change herself, we have one child. \r\n\r\nI love Islam too much and I love anyone I feel he is religious, and I have strong hatred to those who are immoral especially if they insist on sinning or announce their sins. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nMy marriage and divorce experiment was the bitterest I had in my life. I now fear I repeat the bitter experience again. I wish to find who will help me be more religious. How can I be assured while people are content to show opposite of who they really are? Especially when it comes to such matters as marriage. \r\n&nbsp;\r\nBefore I married that woman I prayed istikhara many times and consulted Allah, I was sometimes crying and asking Allah to guide me, especially when I see bad signs from her side or from her family that indicates they are not religious people.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI am not trying to say it is not my fault, or to show myself as the better one in this relationship. By I love Islam, by Allah, and am very jealous for Islam, and I hate lying strongly. Briefly, I do not think it is in my hands to get the right one even if I ask very well and collect information about the girl or try to test her personality before marriage. Unless if Allah has mercy on me and blesses me with giving me a righteous wife. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nMarriage nowadays became very difficult. I, by Allah, think it is of the most difficult matters, and the most difficult part of it is finding a moral and religious wife. I think it is impossible unless Allah permits.  When I read or hear the mentioned verse, I feel very sad; does it mean that I chose my previous wife because I deserve this? I know it is a test from Allah, but I want to have a clear explanation of the verse and, if possible, the rest of my queries.","question_url":"\/en\/103845","question_no":"103845","status":"done"},{"id":"1193","category_id":"242","question":"What is al-lawh al-mahfooz?.","question_full":"Could you explain in detail including\r\n      tafseer of the great scholars of Islam (Ibn Katheer ,At-Tabari etc.)the notion\r\n      &quot;allauh al mahfuz&quot; mentioned in the Holy Qur'aan (85:22)?

He often used to sit with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who sent him on an errand one day to the markets of Madinah. He passed by one of the houses of the Ansaar, and looked at the door of the house, which was open. There was a curtain to the hamaam (bathroom) that was closed, but the wind came and lifted the curtain, behind which there was a woman who was doing ghusl. He glanced at her once or twice, then he realised what was happening and took the matter very seriously. He was afraid that verses would be revealed concerning him and that he would be described as one of the hypocrites because of this sin. He was afraid to go back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he went out into the desert, and no one knew where he had gone. When three days had gone by, (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) instructed some of the Sahaabah to go and look for him in Madinah, but they found no trace of him. He waited until forty days had passed, then he instructed them to look for him in the wilderness areas, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was worried about him. They went and looked for him, and they came to a group of Bedouin and described him to them. The Bedouin said: Perhaps you are looking for the weeping boy? They said: Where is he? They said: On the slopes of this mountain; he will come down at the end of the day. So they lay in wait for him then they caught him and carried him to his house, because he was exhausted from weeping so much. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went to him, and Tha&lsquo;labah asked him whether any verses had been revealed concerning him. He said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Tha&lsquo;labah became very sick, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sat beside him until he died (may Allah be pleased with him). Then they offered the funeral prayer for him and when they carried the bier to bury him, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was walking on tiptoe. &lsquo;Umar asked him about that and he said: &ldquo;Woe to you, O &lsquo;Umar.

About two years ago, I decided that it was time that I should fulfill the other half of my religion and get married, as living as single man in a western country sets you up for all kinds of temptations. Anyway, I went to my home country, where I felt the chances of meeting someone that suited me was greater, and was introduced to several different girls, until finally I came across a girl who I felt I would like to know better. Being overseas, I had little time to really spend too much time with her, so I did the following things before I made a decision: my mother sat with her and told me she was a wonderful girl and she would be good for me. I asked several people about her and not one person had a bad thing to say. I met with her also and found her to be extremely well mannered, have strong knowledge in religion and someone that would make a good wife. And obviously, in the end, I relied on Allah. Both my mother and I prayed that I was doing the right thing, and I also prayed Istikhara to help with my decision. Well, we got married without a problem, and she got a visa extremely easily to come to where I live. I though everything was going well. Now please let me make one thing clear, she is an absolute dream to live with. I have absolutely no problem with her and she is loved by my whole family. My problem is this: I cannot for the life of me find any interest in her sexually.

But I want a person who understands my enthusiasm for Islam and will be better than me in knowledge so that I can learn from him. But my parents are telling me that I could teach him.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy father also used to abuse me sexually from the time I was eleven years old, and I was terrified and very young, so I kept quiet. When I got older, I told my mother, but she is weak and is afraid that my father will leave her, so she believed him and not me.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow my parents do not like me and they call me a &ldquo;Wahhabi&rdquo; because I am not a Shaafa&lsquo;i like them. They insult me all the time in front of other family members. Now, praise be to Allah, my younger brother and my sisters are religiously committed, but my parents are telling me to stop contaminating the minds of their children. It is difficult for me to obey them because they are asking too much of me and they are persisting in mistreating me and calling me names. I no longer have any relationship with my father who refuses to speak to me about anything apart from exchanging greetings, because he says that I have accused him of serious things and because I only asked him not to touch me in that way. He believes that he is in the right and he does not believe that he has ever done anything wrong, because he did that to all of my sisters, but they did not say anything although one of them ran away from home.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow there is a brother who my brother thinks is suitable for me; he is religiously committed and has knowledge, but he is not from my country and my parents rejected him because they want me to marry my paternal cousin. I do not care about their rejection of this brother, but they are refusing to meet him and they say that the Prophet said that we should marry someone who is compatible to us, i.e., one of our family. I have tried to speak to them but they always insult me, and my mother cries and says that no one wants to listen to her and obey her.

Is my father right when he says that he has the right to do whatever he wants with us, because he is our father and it is even permissible for him to have intercourse with us. He said that it is haraam for us to say no to our parents because Prophet Ibraaheem never said no to his parents. I want to obey my parents but they are making it extremely difficult.

My marriage to her was done as follows: I informed her of my wish to marry her, and she agreed to be my wife. But she did not have any guardian, because her father is Christian and would never accept her marrying a Muslim, and he does not care about her anyway. So she gave herself to me in marriage without a wali (guardian), and I followed the view that it is permissible for a previously married woman to give herself in marriage. Because we met in a foreign country, where I do not know anyone who could witness the marriage, I followed the view that the testimony of two witnesses to the marriage can be replaced by an announcement, because the purpose served is the same. So I contacted two sincere friends by phone and informed them of this marriage, so that announcement of the marriage could be done, and I informed others after that. I also gave her a mahr (dowry) and informed her that this mahr is her right as a wife. The mahr was in the form of a gold ring. I told her that this marriage was witnessed by Allah and that she was like a wife to me, and she had to be sincere to me as a wife and not commit any sin. She agreed to marriage on the basis of these conditions, and we got married and lived as husband and wife. Nevertheless I fear Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and I am afraid that everything I have done may be invalid and subject to the ruling on zina (adultery or fornication). Recently I have been faced with some problems in my work and with my first wife, and I am afraid that Allah is punishing me. Yet I do not think there is anything wrong with my second marriage; she is Christian and has sacrificed a great deal.

I told him I don&rsquo;t know how an Islamic divorce actually works, so I will handle the legal documents from the state, and he can handle the Islamic part, but I don&rsquo;t think he even knows how to go about that. I should probably state that we have only been married for four months. I married him two weeks after he was released from prison, because he said that he could not live with me if we were not married. We had a previous relationship with several children involved before he went to prison and became a &ldquo;practicing Muslim&rdquo; I agreed to a lot of things in regards to Islam in our household, letting him teach the children about Islam, giving up a male friend that I had for numerous years before I knew him, no pork, no music, no alcohol, dressing conservatively, etc. I even agreed that once we could afford to, I would get my tubal ligation reversed, because he says it is against Islam for my tubes to be tied, (even though the surgery and a future pregnancy has the potential to cause me great harm). I never said that I would stop celebrating some holidays and he agreed. I never promised that I would convert either, but now this is a problem. He feels as though he cannot deal with me because I haven&rsquo;t converted yet. I told him that I used to have a genuine interest in Islam, until he continuously &ldquo;harassed me about it&rdquo; I try to hold conversations with him, and he says unless it is about Islam, there is nothing to talk about. We are both not happy, but I don&rsquo;t think that divorce is a good idea either. One major issue is that he feels as though I hate Islam, which I don&rsquo;t, but I have said some not so nice things to him about Islam, because he constantly belittles me and is very condescending about my religion. Are we allowed to agree to disagree about our religious views? I also am very concerned that he is talking to women on Facebook, one who he has had a prior sexual relationship with, but he states that it is all innocent, he is only talking with them about Islam, but I was able to see messages where he asked several women if they were married or not, which I don&rsquo;t feel is appropriate. He also made conversation with a woman from another country about flying her here to the US. How can he do this? He is not even taking care of me and our family. He has no money, or work, and I take care of us all, all 13 of us. A lot of things that he does and says seem to push me further away from Islam, because he seems so selfish and I feel like he uses Islam to excuse behaviors that I feel are inappropriate. We were once having relations in the bedroom, and we had not had intercourse yet, but he had already climaxed, so when we tried to have intercourse, because I hadn&rsquo;t yet climaxed of course, he withdrew in the midst of it, got up, and said we&rsquo;ll try later it&rsquo;s time for prayer. I felt very hurt and ashamed, but he said he doesn&rsquo;t have to justify anything to me. I thought Muslims were to treat their wives with kindness. He says that he can&rsquo;t love me because I am not Muslim. Is this true? He also says that I am not allowed to talk to anyone about our marital problems, but what am I to do if I can&rsquo;t even get him to talk to me about our problems? When I bring to his attention about facts in Islam, that he is not adhering to, he states that I am not a believer, and can&rsquo;t tell him anything about Islam. I even told him some information that I learned from this website, that he also frequents, but he still says I have no right to question him, and that I am just fuel for the Hell-fire because obviously Allah has placed a veil over my heart.

But before they got married they were in a haraam relationship and they committed immoral actions several times. Now it seems to them, after reading a fatwa, that their marriage is invalid and that it must be annulled as they did not repent before marriage. In fact they only repented after marriage.\r\n\r\nWhat should they do now? Do they have to annul their marriage now and then repeat it without any need for &lsquo;iddah? Does this mean that their children are the result of haraam and immoral actions (are they illegitimate)? Do they come under the ruling on zaanis (fornicators) for the duration of their marriage? Is annulment a straightforward procedure, or is it a lengthy process like talaaq (divorce)? Can they be excused because of their ignorance? All they want to do is live a clean married life that is pleasing to Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. Please note that the girl got her period once before they got married and the young man did not have intercourse with her after that until after they got married; that is, he wanted to make sure that she was not pregnant before marriage. Allah knows that they did not know that repentance is stipulated as a condition of marriage being valid, otherwise they would not have hesitated to repent straightaway at that time. What about the children, do they not deserve some consideration in this situation? Can they stay together for the sake of the children only, without any sexual intimacy?

He is religiously-committed and of good character, and he comes from a rsespectable family, as her own family have attested, because they know him from before. My friend was astonished when her father and mother refused this man, even though they praised his religious-commitment and good character. The reason they gave for their refusal was that he is not from their tribe, and it is a shame for them to let their daughter marry someone who is not from their tribe. My friend tried every way to convince them, but without success. She asked some people to speak to her father and two of her male cousins went and asked about the man and found out that he is good, and they went to her father (to convince him to let her marry him), but without success. She tried to remind her father that she is getting too old and has few chances of marriage, and she told him that Allaah would punish him, but without success, because he is under the thumb of the mother who does not want her to get married, not because of tradition or custom, but because she wants her to find a job as a teacher so she can take her salary. This is the problem. My question is, should this girl go to the court so that the qaadi will marry her to this young man? Will that take a long time before the marriage is done, i.e., will the qaadi summon her father and will there be lengthy procedures? This makes her afraid because if she goes to the court the first time and the judge makes an appointment for the hearing on another day, her family may prevent her from attending and the matter may be decided without her being present.

The man and woman tried to convince the family to agree, and the man strove hard to improve his level of education. For four years the man and the woman tried hard to in approval because of the love between them and because they had promised before Allah that they will never part. Praise be to Allah, the family finally agreed and the marriage contract was done in the presence of the father and mother and his family and witnesses, with the blessings of all concerned. But during the previous four years there were haraam meetings between the couple. Allah is witness that they do not want to remember it, and praise be to Allah that after marriage they lived a decent life and had children, and now they have a lovely family and the couple have kept away from everything that angers Allah. Allah enabled them to go for Hajj and perform &lsquo;umrah a number of times. They were deeply in love, by Allah's grace, until one day, after ten years, they heard one of the shaykhs on the radio saying that whoever has a haraam relationship has to announce his repentance before getting married, otherwise the marriage is invalid. From that point doubts set in: does this apply to them? In other words, should the contract be annulled or not? After all this time, from the time of the marriage contract, they did not commit any sin against Allah and they have tried to make their life good. There was no one else for either of them. Because it has been such a long time they are confused about their situation. Was there any intimacy which deserved to be punished, either by a disciplinary punishment (ta&rsquo;zeer) or a hadd punishment? But what is certain is that the full consummation came after marriage, i.e., they are not certain that any immoral action took place because there is no evidence to indicate that. Are they regarded as having committed zina and does what is mentioned in Soorat al-Noor apply to them? Because from various tafseers they understood the meaning of this verse as applying to people who behave in such a manner all the time.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is the problem in brief. Should this marriage contract be annulled or not? If that was done before marriage because of lack of knowledge, are they to be blamed for not their lack of knowledge? What the woman remembers is that she menstruated after marriage and also before the marriage contract was done, but she is not certain of the timing, i.e., was it shortly beforehand or a long time before. One thing remains to be asked: if one of the two parties did any of these abhorrent things when he was 16 years old with someone who was younger for a while at the time of adolescence and then stopped doing that for several years, and does not think that he did it until he met the person he married, does that affect the current problem, or should he conceal it and not mention it?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope that you can advise us of the solution that will protect us from meeting Allah with our faces darkened by sin before Him, and so that we may rather meet Allah with hearts that know what Allah has forbidden and have found the right way to the Hereafter. We only want to know whether their lives now are halaal or haraam, because since they found out about this matter their lives have been affected by waswaas after they were happy.","question_url":"\/en\/106288","question_no":"106288","status":"done"},{"id":"1748","category_id":"345","question":"Her brother is in jail and her paternal uncles are in another country.

I have always considered myself a religious man who follows the 5 pillars of Islam and does a lot of dawah. Previously I went to work and offered my assistance at a Masjid and Madrassa in another country for approximately 2 years. After the first year I was interested in getting married to a 22 year old new Muslimah convert from the country I was working in who also used to volunteer sometimes in the same madrassa I was working in. Because she was a new convert and her family was not Muslim, she did not have a Wali. She told her parents that she wanted to get married to me and they agreed at first but they wanted to talk to the Imam of the Masjid I was working in since he was the only Islamic authoritative figure in that country. They wanted to hear from the Imam if Islam permits their daughter to get married to me so soon. So the parents and her went to the Masjid together to meet with the Imam and the Imam told them that she should not get married to me and that she should delay her marriage until he finds someone from the same nation and just to be my friend but not more. The parents took the Imam&rsquo;s advice because they already thought she shouldn&rsquo;t get married since it was strange to get married so soon in their culture. The Imam just supported them by telling them what they wanted to hear (that she shouldn&rsquo;t get married). I and other brothers were very disappointed at this because the Imam was preventing us to get married and we thought this was not fair or right. I have read some articles from your website saying a new Muslim convert does not have to inform her non- Muslim parents if she is getting married to a Muslim and an Imam can act as her Wali. So I thought it would be okay to not tell her parents and get married to her by having my local Imam in my country act as her Wali since the imam in her country told her and her parents not to marry me. We took the liberty of flying to my home country and marrying there through my local imam in front of 3 Muslim witnesses. However, I&rsquo;m not sure if what I did was permissible or not and if my marriage is valid because she traveled with me to my home country without a Mahram. Her parents found out later that we got married and they have no problem with us being married now and we have been living together now for almost 3 years.

But the problem is that my parents lived in a village and I lived in another city for seek of my job and study. Some of the relatives of my spouse also live in the same village (also her relatives are not happy about this engagement. The only reason is cast difference). My mother in law is insisting that she would not be going to marry her daughter me until I buy a house at city where I am living for my job\/study (I visit my parent twice a month) and also marriage ceremony will not take place at my village. They conveyed these two statements to me. I clearly told them before the engagement that I have not enough resources to buy a house in city but I will take one on rent and so far as marriage is concerned it will take place at village. But right know they are insisting to do at city and also buy house first otherwise they will break this engagement. Both of these are not possible for me and I know it in advance that my parents will also not agree to have marriage ceremony at some other place. My parents are of the view that after marriage, they will help us to shift to city. I liked the girl very much and in fact I prayed for her for many times. I fear that if I say that both of your conditions are not possible for me they will negate the engagement. I do not want to lose the girl.

Now I am working in a village that is about 150 km from my town, i.e., it takes an hour and a half to get there and an hour and a half to get back. My life revolves around my family, study and work. I have no friends and I only visit my relatives and acquaintances rarely. I hardly ever go out of the house except for necessities, or to take a trip with my family, or to go to work or to attend some courses. Sometimes I go to a health club with my mother (for health reasons and to keep fit). I grew up in a family that is decent and fairly religiously committed; we pray regularly and do what Allaah has enjoined upon us. Because of my work, and being away from my family, and my position among my siblings (I am the eldest), I got used to being independent and self-reliant, and to having others respect my opinion. My parents are the closest friends I have, and I do not hide any of my secrets from them. I got to know the internet in 1422 AH, and I looked at many websites, with the aim of improving my English and developing a way of teaching it. I looked for different sites that had to do with women, the family and married life. Six months ago whilst I was on a website for practising English, I got a private message from someone who want to talk to me about some issues that had to do with teaching English and the difficulties faced with female students, especially since he was a graduate from the English language college. He was looking for work and he is two years younger than me. After two or three exchanges on this website and via brief e-mails, he asked me some personal questions such as how old I am, where I live and the customs of my family. Finally he told me that he wanted to propose marriage to me, so I gave him my father&rsquo;s phone number, simply to find out if he was being honest. In fact he called my father and about two weeks later he and his family visited us. At first our families were hesitant, especially since they were concerned about the way we had got to know each other, and because of our customs and traditions and the differences in customs and traditions (as I am from an ordinary family and he is from high-status family). After a few visits from his family and discussions with my family, he and I were able to make them accept this matter. Praise be to Allaah, my fianc&eacute; has been appointed in a village that is close to his city, and soon he will get approval from the bank for a muraabahah loan so that he can complete the plans for our wedding. After we had been engaged for a while, we began to speak on the phone (I know that we did wrong on this point, especially since the marriage contract had not yet been done) and through these conversations we got to know one another better, and I noticed a few things about him: some positive things (he prays regularly) which encouraged me to go ahead and marry him, especially since I had refused some people before him for one reason, which was that they did not pray or were careless about it; he is religiously committed and does not listen to music; he does not smoke cigarettes or the narghile, which also encouraged me because I had refused people before him for one reason, which was that they smoked; he is good natured and uncomplicated; we have a great deal in common and hold similar views on various issues; we are both teachers; we both work; we have similar hopes for the future with regard to the family, children and continuing to study.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, I feel that his religious commitment does not stem so much from conviction but from his upbringing and his family&rsquo;s traditions. He wants to impose some things on me, not because they are part of Islam so much as for social appearances, so that he will appear to be a religious person who is strict; the way he and his family look at me and my family &ndash; they think that we are not religiously committed and are not modest enough, and that our womenfolk are dominant and controlling and direct the men according to their whims, although I think that most men in the world do what their wives want even if they show the opposite. They regard us as being of an inferior lineage to them, and one of the hardest things in a marriage is if one party looks down on the other or does not think that the other is able to fulfil the duties of married life. He wants me to devote myself and my life fully to him and his children, and to stop working and forget myself completely and give up all my dreams of completing my studies, improving my work performance or doing any other activities, or even going to the health club. If I exercise that will be a favour from him because the time that I spend on these things belongs rightfully to him and his children!&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI am not against marriage or taking care of the children or serving the husband, but I believe that it is the wife&rsquo;s right to have her own interests and privacy.  &nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe thinks that housework is one of my duties, and if I employ a servant it must be at my own expense, because she will be doing my job. He objected strongly to my father&rsquo;s condition of providing a servant in the marriage contract, and he thinks that this will make him look bad in front of his family, and that my conditions are impossible to fulfil. Don&rsquo;t the daughters of the tribes and high-status families have difficult conditions or demands too? Please note that my family only stipulated that because they feared I might face problems that happen to working wives with their husbands because of having servants, and because the men in our society forget that housework is the husband&rsquo;s responsibility according to Islam, and he is free either to do it himself or bring servants; if his wife does it, it is a favour on her part. Please note that I do not like to have a servant in the house, and with a little cooperation between the spouses and children, and using machines, and using external sources of help such as sending the clothes to the laundry and putting the children in daycare when one is at work, one can do away with the need for a servant and avoid the evils and problems that servants may bring. Men nowadays are no better than the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who served his family and did housework.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe wants me to stop listening to music and not watch movies and soap operas, and not to wear pants, and to wear the abayah that comes down from the head, even though I have told him about my opinion on these matters. As for music, I am not bothered about it and I will give it up at the first opportunity. As for watching films and soap operas, I do not think it is haraam, and with regard to studying English it is a means of practising listening to the English language.  As for soap operas, I only watch those that serve a purpose and are useful. With regard to wearing pants, I told him that I am a smart person and I know how to dress according to the time and occasion and the people I am going to meet. When I am at school and there are official visits, or I visit people I do not know, I do not wear pants, but I like to wear them on days off or trips out, because they are more covering for me as I move a lot. With regard to the abayah that comes from the head, I do not wear it because there is basically no specific way for Muslim women to wear hijab, and based on my experience I have found that it does not suit me. The abayah that comes from the shoulders and is closed in front, with a lose headscarf and a cover for the face is better for me and more covering, especially if I am carrying things or carrying children, or I am walking a long way. He thinks that all the places I go on trips to with my family (markets, trips to the seaside, leisure centres, even the corniche) are places of mixing and he cannot take me there. I have tried to understand his protective jealousy, but to be honest I am afraid that he is going to keep me locked up in the house, and I will only go out to visit family and relatives which I do not like very much, especially because of the gossip, destructive envy and grudges that happen among women. He says that I do not know how to communicate with him, and my approach is dry and I often offend him. I hope that you can teach me, because I have doubts about my abilities and I feel deep regret when I see that he is hurt by me.","question_url":"\/en\/88125","question_no":"88125","status":"done"},{"id":"1862","category_id":"348","question":"Should she agree to marry a man who lives in a kaafir country?.","question_full":"I am a 23 year old woman.

Secondly he has been practising for less time than me and therefore I feel he has less knowledge than me, which I find an of put as I feel he should be my guide not vice versa.  However he does have a thirst for knowledge and does study the deen and also wishes to take out a year or so to go abroad and study the deen (which is what I also want to do).  Apart from these two issues I feel we are compatible in many other ways.  We have the same vision in life.  Whilst paying Salat-ul-Istikhara I am getting no clear sign, except at times I get a tight feeling in my heart at times, which puts me off, but then I also think I should go for this as he has many good qualities.  Im not sure as to what to do and am really confused, I dont know what this feeling in my heart means.  I have met him once and there will be another meeting this Friday, but I dont want to lag it on any longer than necessary as it is playing with peoples emotions.  Please get back to me with a reply soon as I really need some advice, especially regarding my Istikhaara as it is confusing me.","question_url":"\/en\/22453","question_no":"22453","status":"done"},{"id":"1903","category_id":"348","question":"He is attracted to a woman who is engaged to someone else.","question_full":"A friend of mine proposed marriage to a woman and they have seen one another within the limits prescribed in Islam, but they have not yet gotten married.

Since her divorce she has been very attached to me. So much so that she came from her city to marry me here and visit me and stay with me for a few days (my family are in another city). She calls me every day and gets in touch via e-mail. We agreed several times to get married, but I changed my mind every time out of fear for my children and the breakup of my family. But at the same time I feel very sorry for her, because she sacrificed her life and her daughters for the sake of our happiness together (even though I did not ask her to get divorced). I want to marry this woman, but at the same time I cannot forget that she was the wife of another man before me and she had sex with him.

At that time I had not taken her back (formally, as a wife). After a short while I sought a fatwa and was told that it was permissible for me to take her back but I did not ask whether the second talaaq had taken place or not. Two years later there were major problems in which her family played a major role, and I divorced her, but during the &lsquo;iddah I met her and there happened between us that which happens between husband and wife. I asked one of the scholars working in the court in my city and he gave me a fatwa in writing stating that the divorce that I did not ask about did not count as such, because a divorce issued to an already-divorced woman does not count, and my taking her back by means of intercourse was valid, and I also asked two friends to testify that I had taken her back and told my wife about that, but I did not tell her family because of the severity of the discord in the family. My family got angry with me when they found out that I had taken her back. But I asked her to bear that with patience and to let the taking back continue in secret until I was able to become independent of my family. After one year, during which I used to meet with her in secret and we would sometimes do what husbands and wives do, Allaah blessed me with the opportunity to travel abroad to complete my studies.

I asked her to wait for one or two months, and I would tell her how Allaah had granted me a way out, then I left and did not tell her. One week after I left, my family suddenly told me that my ex-wife (or so they thought) had got married! I became very distressed and I did not know what to do, as I was abroad and I did not believe it. I tried to contact my wife and she told me that she thought that I was deceiving her all that time and that I had betrayed her, because she knew that the period of travel would not be less than five years, and she claimed that she had consulted a scholar on the radio as to whether intercourse with the wife without the intention of taking her back was regarded as taking her back or not, and he told her that the intention was essential.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI asked for advice and was told that I had the right to refer the matter to court to seek a separation, or to divorce her, so long as I told her so that she could observe the iddah following divorce.

I was divorced about one week ago, after I left my husband&rsquo;s home a year before; I took my son who is two years old and stayed with my family. In the beginning of our love marriage I lived with him in his mother&rsquo;s home. His mother started to interfere in everything in our life. He asked me to work and support him to pay off the loan he borrowed for our marriage. I found a job and helped him; my only condition was to live in an independent place alone far from his mother&rsquo;s continuous interference. He promised me to do this. His mother was in control of everything at home; my husband was unable to object to anything otherwise she would ask him to leave. She works as well.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI lived with my husband and tried him for two years I found him to be another person different from who I loved; he was just masked before marriage. He started taking all my salary and gives me just daily expenses. Whenever he was in need he used to ask me to sell my gold for him, which I have done, so has he. He used to ask me to borrow from my family, which I did, in return he never gave me anything. I was deprived of everything. He used to say one sentence a lot to me: &ldquo;you know our circumstances so be tolerant&rdquo;. He used to hide his wallet in the car and say that I do not have the right to what he has or what he does not have. Problems started to get bigger and bigger, and I kept asking him to find a separate place for us to live.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe has a divorced sister, she works and sleeps in her work place which is a hotel located outside the city, when she used to come to visit us she used to stay up at night outside the home and returns every night after midnight. I did not like the whole situation and I had to tell my respectful husband: &ldquo;what will the neighbors say about this home we live in, this is shameful&rdquo; his answer was usually: &ldquo;I will speak to them&rdquo; I do not like this, after all he said to me: &ldquo;these are our traditions, and I cannot leave my mother and sister and live far from them alone&rdquo; as they are not Arabs. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI was hesitant to tell my family about my situation because they all objected to this marriage and refused it but I insisted on marrying him because I thought he is moral and kind. How blind was I! I told my family that I heard him speaking to his mother complaining about me and she told him to beat me and to take my son from me. Then I left him and went to my family. Two weeks later he came to my family&rsquo;s home to ask why I left home. I did not tell him that I heard anything. And just asked him to buy us a separate place to live alone. He agreed. We went to see the home we were going to buy, then he changed his mind, this situation remained for two years during which he accused me of having a relationship with someone else, and that this other person is spoiling my mind, this happened because my husband saw me with a man who is a friend of my father taking me from my work place. I found him there by chance and my husband was standing in the street at my work area, I asked this man to take me home because I feared my husband might hurt me. After this he started to defame me and give me two options, whether to stay with him in his mother&rsquo;s home or to sacrifice all my rights then he divorces me. I of course refused and insisted on divorce, I did not want a separate home anymore. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy husband brought two &lsquo;disobedience cases&rsquo; against me, and then I asked for divorce through the court. The last five months I, by chance, spoke with the same man who took me by car from work, he is 14 years older than me. I told him about my story and what happened with me, he stood for me and taught me about life and people, and that there are matters one should not stand silent for them. He told me that accepting to marry my husband was a mistake from the beginning and that I was mistaken when I refused to listen to my family&rsquo;s advice. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI became attracted to him, although I know that it is wrong. I feel guilty because I love him and he loves me, this was not planned. We met many times, sat and talked a lot and he asked me to marry him before I got divorced. I wish I can accept but I am afraid of the consequences. I fear Allah, I fear I made a mistake when I loved another man while I am still married, although I left my husband 15 months ago, I got divorced about two weeks ago.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease guide me.

She swore by Allah to me while we are in the sacred mosque that it was just talking and that she did not commit adultery with him. She also said that she wanted to leave him but he threatened her.

Please note that my wife&rsquo;s mother is mentally unstable. Her ex-husband told me about that, as did my wife. Between the marriage contract and the wedding party, my wife&rsquo;s mother put pressure on my wife and insulted her, so we decided to bring the wedding forward. I asked her wali for permission to bring it forward and he gave me permission and set a date for the wedding. But the wedding happened to be on a day when the girl&rsquo;s mother was travelling, and we knew that she would be travelling. We asked her several times to tell us the date when she would be travelling, but she did not tell us anything, even though she knew the date when she would be travelling and when she would be coming back.

My mother is very demanding and fights with me all the time about my husband who has been very good to me and my children and her. She wants him to take her traveling and other things that involve spending a lot of time with her and he does not wish to do due to his demanding job as a doctor and because he feels that they will not get along. She visits our home at least 4-5 months every year and makes me take her out on a daily basis not even worrying that it makes me neglect my home and children. She is also very busy trying to make her own businesses so she fought with me about taking my brother or sister to live with me (they are 16 and 18) and tells me it is my right and I don&rsquo;t need to even have my husband&rsquo;s permission on the matter. She also refuses to pay a loan that her and my father (who passed away 2 years ago) made me take when I was in college attending a university I didn&rsquo;t even want to attend when I was 16 years old, this loan has destroyed my name making it impossible for me to buy anything with my name. She has done this to many people she owes money. On top of this, before my father passed away, he had written all properties and money in her name to make it easier to disperse to each of us (we are four girls and one boy) rather than involving an outside party; after he died, she said it is all in her name, and that she paid for a lot of his businesses before they succeded so she will keep all the money as her own until she dies. I even gave her about $100,000 (all the money I have ever saved and worked for) because she pretended that she was going to use it to pay off my dad&rsquo;s debts and she used it for a summer house instead and denies I ever gave her a penny since I never told anyone else because I wanted it between me, my mom and Allah swt even though I know she has a lot of money of her own. My husband was tired of this (and many more bad situations) and so he confronted her about the least of these problems &ndash; the old school loan, that was taken over 6 years before we were even married and keeps on multiplying in debt and on my name. He then continued to confront her about the many wrong things that have happened and involved his family too. She got very angry and didn&rsquo;t want to speak to either of us. Naturally, I wanted to fulfill my obligations to my mother so I managed to get on good speaking terms with her so I do not defy silaat al rahim. We speak fine most of the time but after a couple weeks of that she will go back to insulting my husband, telling me to defy him and disobey him in order for him to apologize to her, and insulting me and my husband with very hurtful and shameful words. This relationship is badly affecting my marriage and my time at home and with my children. I cannot think about anything else and my husband doesn&rsquo;t want to apologize because he is right and feels my mom has not changed her bad ways and will not even pay off the old loan. And at the same time it is extremely difficult to communicate with her on a healthy level. We live in two different countries (me in America and her in Egypt) and she says if I love her and don&rsquo;t want to upset Allah swt that I will bring my three kids and visit her, my husband does not want me to leave him and she knows this and insists that I am being a bad muslim and that Allah swt will punish me for disobeying my mother. I have tried to advise her to fear Allah swt and she gets mad and says I should obey her and be against my husband. My husband tells me to try to keep good ties with her as much as I can, and is a very good husband and father otherwise, Alhamdolilah we have a very happy marriage and three healthy children. And so my questions are: 1. What are my obligations to my mother in such an ugly situation, keeping in mind that she continues to insult my husband in our phone calls (we live in two different countries) and asks me to disobey and defy him and cause problems in order for him to apologize to her. This communication has left me emotionally drained, it is what I think about most of my days and it wastes so much of time that I can use with studying or caring for my home. What is the minimum in regards to visiting and speaking to her so that Allah swt will not be angry with me and at the same time I will fulfill my obligation to her and not have to worry about her saying that Allah swt is upset. 2. Who is responsible for this loan. Keeping in mind that I was forced to attend this university, told to take a loan by mother and father, was only 16-18 years old and my husband was not told about this loan before marriage. Also, my mother has more than enough money to pay it off. Your help is deeply appreciated and greatly needed as soon as possible.","question_url":"\/en\/110845","question_no":"110845","status":"done"},{"id":"2272","category_id":"356","question":"A wife should not let anyone enter her husband\u2019s home except with his permission.","question_full":"When should a husband or wife allow or not allow others &lsquo;mahrams or non-mahrams&rsquo; to enter the couple&rsquo;s home?.","question_url":"\/en\/112048","question_no":"112048","status":"done"},{"id":"2273","category_id":"356","question":"He wants to stay up and he disturbs his wife, and she is complaining about his actions.

My parents did not want me to see my fiance anymore and felt that he was not a healthy match for me. I agree that he was disrespectful and immature sometimes, but I also loved him and made excuses for his behavior. He lived in another town so we basically had a long distance relationship, and misunderstandings began to pile up. He started to demand that I move in with him immediately or he would divorce me. I told him that we agreed to have a wedding first, and he said we could do that later, but for the time being I was his wife and I had to live with him. It was so hard for me to have to choose between my parents and my fiance. I didn't see him as a \"husband\" yet and it was very confusing and frustrating and I told him I could not choose over my parents. So my fiance ended the relationship and sent a letter to our imam saying that he divorced me.

I have three children (19yr Son, 17yr Daughter, 16yr Son), Alhumdulillah. Presently the Father is the primary parent with the custody of the children. Two of my children, the 19 yr old son (cerebral palsy-wheelchair bound) and the 17 yr old daughter(mentally retarded) are children with special needs (handicapped). They are totally dependent for their everyday needs (wearing diapers and have to be fed). Their physical, emotional and cognitive age at present has been diagnosed, for the 19 yr old son to be somewhere around 5 yrs and for my 17 yr old daughter to be under 3 yrs old, according to the psychiatrist. Both of these handicapped children have their own estate money (a mistake from the doctors which they compensated in the form of money\/settlement of a law suit). This money is controlled by the 'Trust'\/Bank-along with a judge through the American law. Each month they are assigned an ($6000.00 approx) amount from this 'Estate money' for their everyday needs. They also have their own home(wheelchair accessible) which the 'Trust' provided and also a Van(wheelchair accessible) for their everyday needs. The 'Trust' also pays the taxes for their house along with the 'fuel' for the van. These two children are totally independent financially. The Father lives with the children in their home and uses their money for every day needs. I have been with my children for all their life as a caretaker and they are very close to me than anyone else. I have not 'worked' for the same purpose. I still go to my children's house every day from morning till evening to take care of them as their father has to go to work. At least ten days out of a month, they come to stay at my house (a one bedroom apartment). The Father compensates me for my work with a $1000.00 every month. The question I have is since the kids are diagnosed under the age of 7 yrs, can I have the primary custody? And also what is the ruling if I want to get married? I know that when the mother marries, the custody goes to the other party, but here since the kids are handicapped and I am the only one to take care of them during the day, and since they are already coming to stay with me for approx ten days out of a month, can I still have the primary custody? If not (If I have to forfeit the primary custody), can I at least take them to my house for 10\/15 days, since I am still the caretaker for their everyday needs during the day for the whole month.

The reason why I asked for the khula was because he refused to financially support me or our daughter and was very negligent towards us. My daughter was less than one years old at the time. For one year, the Imams tried to negotiate a contract with him, but because he is argumentative and very unreasonable, the Imams encouraged me to go to American court so that I could get some financial support for our daughter. I despised going to the American court, but I really felt that I had no other options. I only take what is Islamically reasonable in terms of money for my daughter from my ex-husband.

Couple of days back I came across some fatwas \/ figh explanation from an Islamic forum regarding divorce which made me anxious with regard to my current married life. As a consequence of this, I decided to write to you and seek the correct position InshaAllah.\r\n\r\nI have been married for over 15 years now. Except the past 7 months, I was always living and working alone in different cities \/ countries while my wife used to live with my parents at my home back in my home country. I used to periodically visit my parents once or twice a year for about 2-3 weeks. About 11 years back, I had issued a single divorce (1 time) to my wife in writing who was staying in my house with my parents while I was working in a different city. The family elders thought it wise to send her back to her fathers home while they were trying to resolve the issue and they sent her to her parents. Within couple of months my father passed away and I came home to visit my mother. At that time, I was told that my wife had returned to my house to support my mother. My reply to that was a single word \"Okay\". I do not know for sure if she returned during her iddat or after completion of her iddat period. Anyway, I was upset that she was returned without me revoking the talaaq. I never spoke to her, looked at her or touched her for over 1 year. 6-7 months fter this or so I decided to have sex with her as a result of emotional pressures. Though I was anxious at that time that this may be haram, I thought since I had not said talaaq 3 times this may be Okay. Since then, we continued to live like husband and wife whenever I visited home\r\n\r\nDuring my research in the past few days, I now understand that since I had not revoked the talaaq before she completed her iddat, the talaaq had automatically converted into talaq-e-bain and our subsequent relationship has been illegal.\r\n\r\nCould you please answer the following for me.\r\n\r\nIf my saying &ldquo;okay&rdquo; to being informed that she returned, happened before her iddah expired, can this be considered as having taken her back (though I had not considered it as revoking the divorce and did not have that intention at all)?\r\n\r\nIs our current status a haram one? Is it like we have committed adultery?

I was certain I could never go back to my husband, but I was in love with him, and missed him a lot. I decided to try to make things work for everyone. I started to talk again to my husband, and told him I wanted to return. He agreed. Problem after problem kept coming up though, and my return was always delayed for reasons beyond my control.

He stopped supporting me also after some time, and wouldnt allow me to find work in my country, so I was left at the mercy of whatever I could get from others to live on.

Parents are afraid that if they enforce the law of Allah in their homes, that their children will leave. What is Islam&rsquo;s position on this sort of compromise? Some parents also say that they only have the duty to tell their children something is haram, and then their children have to choose for themselves because they are already young adults (i.e. 13 -18 yrs old and unmarried, living at home). Don&rsquo;t the parents have to forbid haram by all means, or do they just say that is haram and then leave them be? To what extent do parents have to go to forbid their children from haram? Parents also believe that once their children reach the age of puberty they are no longer responsible for their sins or actions, and so say they will have no sin if they advise their children something is haram and then leave them.

All praise be to Allah Who honoured me with an &lsquo;Umrah this year, and I was happy for this, but I feel I am being hard-hearted and that there is no difference between me and the disbelievers because I do not offer prayers. I have tried so many times to keep on praying but I do not know why this keeps happening with me, knowing that I have not been praying for a very long time and I feel ignorant of so many Islamic issues. I feel that Allah will not accept any of my deeds, prayers, Zakat, &lsquo;Umrah, or any other Islamic duty, I feel that my destiny is surely in hell. I need someone who takes my hand and advises me and helps me leave this loss, I hate being in this case!! \r\n\r\nMoreover, there is another problem; I feel that I missed fasting some days of Ramadaan with no excuse to fast not!! \r\n\r\nFrankly I am not sure if those days were of Ramadaan or Shawwal, as it is a habit in our home to fast the six of Shawwal every year so I am confused. This problem has happened to me when I was far from the path of Allah, I know that whoever breaks his fast without an excuse one day of Ramadaan, Allah does not accept his fasting ever, and he has to offer penance, so what shall I do now? \r\n\r\nPlease help me and enlighten me, please, I am very desperate, may Allah add this to your good deeds and reward you.","question_url":"\/en\/83997","question_no":"83997","status":"done"},{"id":"2764","category_id":"424","question":"Sarah\u2019s Jealousy Towards Hajar.","question_full":"When Hajar gave birth to Ismaeel (upon him be peace) was Sarah jealous of her?

I am an ordinary Muslim; I do not have great faith or weak faith. I do the obligatory duties with some shortcomings &ndash; and I hope that Allaah will forgive me &ndash; and I do some of the Sunnahs. I believe in the divine will and decree, both good and bad. About seven years ago I suffered great distress because of a calamity &ndash; which I will not trouble you with &ndash; but I will tell you honestly that initially I panicked, and I was filled with despair, but after approximately one year Allaah guided me, and good people taught me that there was something good in it, by Allaah&rsquo;s leave. They told me that the calamity was either because of a sin that I had committed or it was a test from Allaah, and they advised me to call upon Allaah (du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;) and ask for forgiveness, and to ask of Allaah from his bounty, and to seek to draw closer to Him by means of His beautiful names and sublime attributes, and to do a lot of good deeds, and that by Allaah&rsquo;s leave my request would never be rejected, and that Allaah would answer my prayers. I did all of that, although I do not say that I did it perfectly, but I did the best I could. I said a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; and did a lot of good deeds, and I repented to Allaah sincerely from all my sins, and I asked Allaah to relieve my distress and take away my worry. I prayed to Allaah for guidance (istikhaarah) before doing some things in my life so that my affairs would be set straight, but after doing all these things, my worry and distress only increased, and the calamities and grief grew worse. All the things about which I prayed istikhaarah failed, and brought me trouble. All doors were closed in my face. Allaah forbid that I should complain about Allaah to you, rather I complain about my sorrow and grief to Allaah. But I want to know why Allaah did not answer me? And why did I not succeed in any of my worldly affairs, even though I took the necessary means and put my trust in Allaah, and I did not do anything without praying istikhaarah beforehand, and Allaah helps the kaafir in his worldly affairs if he takes the necessary means. I do not eat haraam things and I do not intend to do bad things to anyone and I pray for everyone to be guided. I heard one of the Shaykhs telling the story of Pharaoh and he said that Allaah said to Moosa: &ldquo;By My Might and Majesty, if he had asked Me to save him I would have saved him.&rdquo; Some questions began to form in my mind: Am I more insignificant before Allaah that Pharaoh, even though I have not committed the sins that he did? If that is not the case, then why is Allaah testing me with these trials even though I do not have a lot of faith? If the reason is my sins, then I have repented from all sins, and I have said a lot of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. If Allaah wants to raise me in status in Paradise thereby, how can that be when Allaah knows that I am not able to bear this trial?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany questions are going around in my mind, they are haunting me and I cannot find any answer. In fact my resolve has started to fail and my faith is beginning to weaken, and I feel very distressed about everything in this world. I can no longer bear this burden. It has gone on too long and I am filled with deep despair and doubt is entering my heart. Were it not that Allaah has forbidden suicide, I would have done it and given myself a break.

I had always been curious about Islam because of my exposure to Malcolm X. I used to always see Muslim women and I absolutely adored them because I thought they were so dignified and beautiful from the way they dressed. However, after leaving home at the age of seventeen. I moved to a city where there were alot of Muslims. I was again exposed to Islam and was given a Quran as a gift. I was so happy and always felt in my heart that there was something so special about this way, though I was ignorant about the teachings. Anyway, it came at a very tender time in my life when I needed direction and help. I had no one, family, or anything but all the negativity surrounding me, from prostitution, drugs, gambling, murderers,robbing,and every thing under. Even all of my aunts and uncles were drug abusers, and there children soon became the same. Thank Allah I never allowed myself to get consumed with all the bad things that were happening around me. My sister and I Started to read the Quran at night and right away it touched my heart in a way that nothing else before had done. We would start to cry when we would read passages about the Hell Fire, because we always believed in HELL and did not want to go there. We knew without a doubt that this book was the truth. I felt that it was just to similar to the bible in many ways but was the next step. Two weeks later we went to the Masjid and took our shahadda. This Quran. Anyway, years passsed and the different stages I had gone through were unbelievable. I have now been married three times by brothers who basically treated me very bad and abandoned me. One of which asked for a divorce when I was pregnant. And when he told me that he did'nt love me I began bleeding profusely until I lost the baby. And the other 2 husbands had metal illnesses that I was unaware of before I married them. Now, that all of this has passed, it has broken me down completely. I used to be so strong and resiliant and now i feel like I am floating in a cloud and lost. How did I lose My Lord when he is so near? How do you get it back? Why did i leave Allah when I know that he says he will test the ones he loves the most? I feel so weak and broken, I feel that I have no value or beauty and now after all this time I have self destructed and doing some of the things that i said I would never do. I get drunk every day at home all by myself and I smoke cigartetts. I really dont want to live nor do I want to die because i know that I am not right.

I am a young woman, twenty years of age, religiously-committed and educated, from a religiously-committed and very conservative family. I live with my mother and sister, as my father died four years ago, and my only brother died three years before that. I fell victim to a friend who betrayed me and managed to take a picture of me without my knowledge, then she took me by surprise when she tinkered with my picture by using a computer programme and put my head on the body of a woman who was in a very immoral situation, and she demanded that I give her 5000 or she would send the picture to my mother. That evil woman knew that my mother suffers from spasms in her chest because of grief, and she said to me literally: &ldquo;If you do not give me the money, I will send the picture to your mother and she will have a heart attack and die like your father and brother.&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI admit that I was na&iuml;ve and I did not handle it well because I was so afraid for my mother and her feelings. She threatened me on the day when we were going to visit my maternal aunt, and I went into my female cousin&rsquo;s room to pray, and I saw her bracelets, necklaces and jewellery, and I thought of stealing as something that came under the heading of necessity that makes forbidden things permissible. I said to myself: I will only take the chain because its value is sufficient for me, even though the jewels were in front of me, and I thought that if I took something from my own house and stole, my mother would find out, so I resorted to stealing from my aunt&rsquo;s house. We have a very good relationship with this aunt and she is the dearest and closest of people to us. The only reason why I stole from my aunt&rsquo;s house was that I could return what I had stolen to my aunt in the form of a gift in the future or some other way. I gave the money to that evil woman and I felt very bad after I had done this, because I had never stretched my hand towards any haraam things before. I am very religiously committed and I am memorizing the Qur&rsquo;aan. After some time, this evil woman asked me for some more money. In the midst of my pain and suffering, my theft from my aunt&rsquo;s house was discovered and my mother was shocked. As soon as she asked me I burst into tears and told her about the whole problem. Praise be to Allaah, my mother is a wise woman and trusts me completely, and she understood the situation, and she regards what happened to me and to her as a test from Allaah, but she criticized me sharply for not turning to her and for committing the sin of stealing. She asked me to pray to Allaah for forgiveness and I calmed down, and she thought that this was the end of the matter.  My mother explained to my aunt what had happened, and returned to her what I had taken from her, but unfortunately my aunt did not believe it. Now the matter has had other consequences that affect my honour and reputation, and when I am with my family and relatives I am one person and when I am away from them I am someone else. When I swore on the Holy Qur&rsquo;aan in my aunt&rsquo;s presence that I was innocent, chaste and righteous, my aunt insisted that what had happened to me was no justification for stealing from her house and that she has lost trust in all young women after what I had done. What made matters worse is that I have a cousin (daughter of my maternal aunt) who always used to say to me: &ldquo;Have you ever loved someone?&rdquo; or whatever, and I would respond by saying that I would never go against sharee&rsquo;ah or religion. When my cousin saw my situation she started to incite her mother against me even more, and there was an argument between my mother who was defending my honour, and my aunt who was accusing me of taking drugs, or that the picture was genuine and was not a fake, and love and affection turned to hatred and resentment.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOur shaykh: I am turning to you to judge between us, for I am a victim who has been accused falsely. I admit that I made a mistake because I committed a sin to get out of this crisis. I admit that I made a mistake because I was not frank with my mother from the beginning, because I was so afraid for her and I thought that I could finish with this matter without her knowing.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope that you can judge between us and my aunt so that the love between us may be restored, if only partially, and the relationship may be restored between my mother and my aunt, whom our relatives thought would only ever be parted by death, especially since I am going to give my aunt your answer to read.","question_url":"\/en\/91868","question_no":"91868","status":"done"},{"id":"2819","category_id":"426","question":"His father wants him to marry his cousin who is close in age to him.","question_full":"Alhamdo Lillah I am a practicing muslim and I am also involved in the work of Tabligh and Dawah.

Yes, I would love to get married. I do not know why I run away from marriage, is it because I fear failing a lot or because I am not confident? I am a hesitant person as for the matters of buying and selling. I grew up in a conservative family; I rarely hear any talk about sex or even references to it. Although I hear a lot how our relatives talk to their sons about sex and make jokes, and the sons feel free to express themselves about sex and marriage. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI fear a lot I fail sexually in my marital life; I even went to have a fertility test, blood tests and other similar things. I do not know if it is my fear of marriage or my desire to stay away from it. Some of the investigations made me doubt myself even more, yet, I still feel it is not the investigations that make me hesitant to marry, it is my fear of it more than anything else. Every time I intend to talk to my family about my marriage I feel terrified.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince my childhood, to be honest, I have convinced myself that it is impossible for me to marry, and that I will stay lonely until I die. If anyone asks me about when I intend to marry, I immediately answer saying: &ldquo;in paradise&rdquo;. I feel that this has been imprinted onto my subconscious. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI want to marry, by Allah I want to marry. My fear of women and failing stays as a barrier between me and marriage.

But when the time to meet her came, I felt big fear from the whole matter, and then said to my family that I do not want to marry this girl. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nI am over thirty years old now.

Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The talaaq of a person who is suffering from waswaas does not count even if he utters the words, if that was not done deliberately, because this utterance happened because of waswaas, not because of his will or intention.

Anyways, my father committed zina (adultery) and my mother caught him with this sin which he committed on his return home; she did not divorce him due to my young age and my younger brother and sister who were at that time 9 years old and 5 years old.We needed a father so she did this for her children, but she refused to sleep with him for a full year due to the pain she was suffering. \r\n\r\nPlease note that neither my father nor mother pray, but my mother is on her way to perform salah inshAllah due to the Muslim friends she has. As for my father, when he drinks alcohol, he used to speak badly about Allah and Muhammed s.a.w. in the most horrific of terms which I refuse to write here. The issue is sheikh, now that I am 20 years of age, my father again committed zina in 2008; I was 19 then and did not make salah. After that calamity, I came to Islam alhamdulillah and sought His help and aid. My mother kicked him out this time but now, a year later he is back in our home. My mother uses an excuse like me now being engaged and soon getting married to bring him back, because she can&rsquo;t spend her life alone without a husband, because eventually my sister and brother will also get married, and she refuses to marry any other good man out there, so she chooses this garbage which I call him. \r\n\r\nMe, now being Muslim and knowing the punishment for this sin when one is married has motivated me in doing some actions. I have spat in the face of the woman my father had sex with; she is Russian. I called her by the worst of names in front of all the people, I have almost engaged in a physical fight with my father due to his action, I have threatened him and his lover, and as for my mother, I have raised my voice sometimes when I speak to her on this subject due to her strange choice of bringing this man back to her life after he has done this act once in 2001, and she forgave him, and now again in 2008.

Of course I completely disagree with this. How is one supposed to uphold family ties when it is always in a mixed environment? We can invite them to our house, where there would be no mixing, but they still want us to go to their house.

I will tell you: we have tried in various ways to talk to her in a calm and friendly manner, but every time, she turned it into a huge argument that ended in conflict; she described herself as the one who is being wronged and as being tested with children who do not respect their mother even though we, as everyone will testify, are good children who try hard to please their widowed mother.  \r\n\r\nThe greatest sacrifice I have made for my mother is that I have always refused to get married, because I know in advance that he will refuse to let me help my mother financially. This is something that I cannot accept. No matter how hard I try to explain to you, you could never imagine my suffering, because all you think is that the only solution is patience. But my problem is that I am no longer able to be patient. My patience has made me sick with high blood pressure and nerves. My only solution is to move away; that does not mean that I will cut off ties with my mother, but I need a place where I can find the peace that I have been deprived of.

My problem is that I hate my father vehemently and I cannot even listen to any news of him. My father transgressed against my rights and the rights of my mother and siblings. He left me when I was small, eight years old, and travelled to another city where he married another woman and forgot that he had two small daughters, me and my sister. We needed him to be with us but he did not care about that. All he cared about was himself. He left me and my mother and my sister with my married brothers, and their wives were mean to us. They created trouble and my brothers believed them. The matter went so far that my mother, my sister and I were kicked out and went to live for a while in my married sister&rsquo;s house, and we went through a lot of problems. I blame my father because he did not think of us and he did not provide us with a peaceful life, and he left us to our fate, to suffer harshness and injustice. After that, we moved with my mother to the same city where my father lives. He has had children from his other wife and he did not treat us fairly. We lived in difficult circumstances and he did not spend on us; my poor mother used to sell our used clothes in order to provide food for us. We have grown up and I still do not see any care from my father. I hate him very much and he does not even deserve to be called a father. He has not provided a decent life for me and my sister, and he does not care about our future with regard to us getting married and settling down. I have become hardhearted because of the difficult circumstances I have gone through. Now he has sold a house of his and given all the money to his other wife and her children, and he did not remember us at all. I hate him very much; am I to be blamed for hating him?

I am afraid he may pass away much earlier than me. Besides the fact that it would be a tragedy by itself, as I understand it would mean for me being on the street with hardly any money. We don&rsquo;t have any children yet. Is that true that if he dies, then the house that we live in has to be sold and divided between his numerous relatives (siblings, nephews, etc)? The house is very small and would fit only 3-4 people at most. Is the accommodation that a husband has to provide to his wife only available for her while he is alive? Were the wives of The Prophet Muhammad forced out of their houses after his death? I cannot live with or inherit from my family, because they are not Muslim. \r\n\r\nMy bridal money won't las me long - a year at most if I would have to rent a place. One eighth of my husband's property won't be enough to buy a place to live. \r\n\r\nAnd you in one of your answers discourage men from marrying a widow. I am starting to think that I should quit the idea of having children, whom I want very much, and go to work. \r\n\r\nThat would mean I would spend the next 10-15 years of my life trying to earn for my own place to live, and then me and my husband will be beyond the age that allows us to have children.

The people who make statistics do not make a difference between a Shiite, bahaa&rsquo;i, Habashi and a Sunni! These Muslims are assimilated in a Christian country of around five million citizens. Even the flag of the country presents the symbol of Christianity, which is the cross. During these last months one group of recently converted Muslims (Sunnis) formed a political party and as their goals they have e.g. trying to stop selling alcohol in the shops, and they went even further to claim that they want to establish sharee&rsquo;ah in this Christian country! It has to be taken in consideration that the Muslims do not have even their complete usual rights like own graveyard, right to do ritual sacrificing of animals and so on! Before we had a graveyard but it became full and because some errors had been committed in its handling additionally there is also some differing between the parties who will take charge of it, the authorities profited from all of that and made it difficult for us to have a new graveyard! So now if some one dies, he is buried in the same graveyard with the Christians and atheists!!! These recently converted Muslims try to be united between each other and to be far from the qabaliyyah and hizbiyyah of the Somalis, and far from the &ldquo;talks of the Arabs and their assimilation&rdquo;. Now the media is focusing on Islam and Muslims here in a negative way by bringing up subjects as: - Divorce is in the hand of the man and the women can not get her complete rights and be free in Islam if she does not want to stay married to her husband&hellip; - Corporal punishment of children in homes (because it is a crime in this country if you slap your children) - Muslim families try to isolate their children from the society and not let them to participate in swimming hours (boys and girls together) and attending the music hours&hellip; - And whether Muslims would like to follow Islamic law or the law of the country. The goal of the media is to distort the image of Islam and to grow hatred in the chests of the common people for they will hate Islam and Muslims: common people usually complain that we are taking their money and enjoying their services and now they will add to that the claim that we would like to apply here Sharee&rsquo;ah which we do not even apply in our home countries! And among the Muslims those who practise their religion are a minority while the majority has become assimilated!!! The media and the researchers base their research results on the opinions of every Tom, Dick and Harry i.e. every common ignorant person is qualified to answer. Especially when the most of people nowadays are just running after fame and worldly gains and are enough fed up with their origin and their home countries which neglect their rights and do not appreciate them as citizens. So the appreciation of non-Muslims can make them to take whatever steps &hellip; even we heard some who gave up Islam for Christianity! When the head of this group that formed the political party was advised concerning the steps that he is taking, he merely answered that he is trying to get publicity to Islam&hellip; (this person was active in politics already in his youth). Now we ask from you to give a general advice to the Muslims in this country and especially to these recently converted Muslims, and to remind us all of our duty in a non-Muslim society and towards its citizens and authorities and to draw for us our limits for we will not be as a hammer that will be used to destroy our own homes or at least not to be a cause to stop even these few rights we enjoy because not everyone has got the possibility to emigrate to an Islamic country. Please if you need more details about the subject you can contact us and we will be pleased to give you more detailed information.
