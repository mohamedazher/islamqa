Give up the internet altogether, for time is the most precious thing \r\n    that a man possesses, and the means that lead to haraam must be given up. \r\n    Keep yourself busy with reading Qur&rsquo;aan, attending lessons and keeping \r\n    company with righteous people, and you will find that which will bring you \r\n    happiness, joy, pleasure and peace of mind.

It is not by doing such actions that the Muslim \r\n    expresses gratitude to his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is \r\n    not in this manner that the Muslim will preserve the great blessings that \r\n    Allaah has bestowed upon him. He should give up these perverse actions which \r\n    go against the sound nature that Allaah has instilled in man, and go against \r\n    all revealed laws, and for which everyone of sound mind will hate him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted that such perverse actions are a sign of \r\n    an idle mind, and he has to give up the things that led him to behave in the \r\n    manner of perverts. Perhaps among these reasons &ndash; and the greatest of them &ndash; \r\n    is having a heart that is devoid of faith, and a soul that is devoid of \r\n    shyness before Allaah and His angels, as well as watching haraam TV series, \r\n    movies and perverse actions, and having a life that is devoid of useful \r\n    work, not wanting to get married and liking to stay alone, and many other \r\n    such reasons which may cause a man to fall into bad ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should hasten to give up this perverse action and repent \r\n    to his Lord.

He must be keen to hasten to protect himself by means of \r\n    marriage to a righteous woman who will help him to remain chaste and obey \r\n    his Lord, and he must stop watching haraam things or staying alone which \r\n    makes it easy for him to fall into immoral ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should also note that he is causing physical and \r\n    psychological harm to himself. He will see the negative consequences of what \r\n    he is doing on his body after a while, and he will see how much \r\n    psychological pain he will suffer, which will deprive him of sleep and \r\n    prevent him from enjoying his food and drink. He will see how much he will \r\n    suffer of physical pain which will prevent him from relieving himself with \r\n    ease, and how much he will suffer of infections and ulcers if he persists in \r\n    this perverse action of his.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sixthly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;He needs someone to explain to him that what he is doing is \r\n    haraam, and to remind him and exhort him (to follow the right path).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who is afflicted with any of these haraam actions has \r\n    to remember two things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>To feel shy before Allaah and \r\n    his angels and before himself too.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>To fear death and to fear lest \r\n    Allaah causes him to die when he is doing that to himself.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to shyness:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We know that he believes that Allaah can see him in all \r\n    situations, but perhaps he forgets about that at the time when he is \r\n    committing this sin.

If the \r\n    son of Adam would be offended by one who commits immoral actions and sins in \r\n    front of him, even if he might also do something similar, then how do you \r\n    think the honourable recording angels will be offended?<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi<\/i>, p. 75&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the salaf said: With you are those who never leave \r\n    you, so feel shy of them and respect them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He would feel shy of doing that in front of people, so how \r\n    can he not feel shy before Allaah and His angels?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to death:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should remember that he does not know when the Angel of \r\n    Death will come to him to take his soul, and he does not know the situation \r\n    that he will be in at that time. Would he like his death to come now, before \r\n    he repents? Would he like his soul to be taken when he is doing this \r\n    perverse action?

What will he say to his \r\n    Lord when he stands before Him?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the salaf said: There are two things that put an end \r\n    of enjoyment of this world for me: remembering death, and remembering the \r\n    standing before Allaah, may He be exalted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez (may Allaah have mercy on him) used \r\n    to gather the scholars and they would talk about death, the Resurrection and \r\n    the Hereafter, and they would weep so much that it was as if there was a \r\n    funeral taking place before them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the salaf said: The one who remembers death is \r\n    honoured with three things: hastening to repent, contentment of heart and \r\n    energy for worship. Whoever forgets death is punished with three things: \r\n    delaying repentance, not being content with enough, and laziness in worship. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It should be noted that a good end is only granted to the one \r\n    who was righteous both inwardly and outwardly, and a bad end is given to one \r\n    who was inwardly corrupt, or who persisted in major sins. It should be noted \r\n    that a man will die as he lived, and his life will end in the manner that he \r\n    persisted in and did not give up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was said to a man who was in the throes of death: &ldquo;Say <i>\r\n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i>.&rdquo; And he started singing, because he used to be \r\n    infatuated by singing. It was said to a drinker when he was dying: &ldquo;Say <i>\r\n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah<\/i>,&rdquo; and he started saying: &ldquo;Drink and pour me \r\n    some.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perhaps what we have mentioned is sufficient to make him give \r\n    up his evil deeds and come back to his Lord, and to ask Him to help him and \r\n    guide him.

These studies also show that \r\n    what the criminals watch on the media and the semi-naked styles of dress in \r\n    which women go out, also lead to the commission of this reprehensible \r\n    crime.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The laws of Islam came to protect women's honour and modesty. \r\n    Islam forbids women to wear clothes that are not modest and to travel \r\n    without a mahram; it forbids a woman to shake hands with a non-mahram man. \r\n    Islam encourages young men and women to marry early, and many other rulings \r\n    which close the door to rape. Hence it comes as no surprise when we hear or \r\n    read that most of these crimes occur in permissive societies which are \r\n    looked up to by some Muslims as examples of civilization and refinement! In \r\n    America &ndash; for example &ndash; International Amnesty stated in a 2004 report \r\n    entitled &ldquo;Stop Violence Against Women&rdquo; that every 90 seconds a woman was \r\n    raped during that year. What kind of life are these people living? What \r\n    refinement and civilization do they want the Muslim women to take part in?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The punishment for rape in Islam is same as the punishment \r\n    for zina, which is stoning if the perpetrator is married, and one hundred \r\n    lashes and banishment for one year if he is not married.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some scholars also say that he is required to pay a mahr to \r\n    the woman.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In our view the man who rapes a woman, whether she is a \r\n    virgin or not, if she is a free woman he must pay a &ldquo;dowry&rdquo; like that of her \r\n    peers, and if she is a slave he must pay whatever has been detracted from \r\n    her value. The punishment is to be carried out on the rapist and there is no \r\n    punishment for the woman who has been raped, whatever the case.

This is the view \r\n    of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, and it is the view of al-Layth, and it was also narrated \r\n    from &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu Haneefah and al-Thawri said: the hadd punishment is to be \r\n    carried out on him but he is not obliged to pay the &ldquo;dowry&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The evidence for what we \r\n    say is that the hadd punishment and the &ldquo;dowry&rdquo; are two rights, one of which \r\n    is the right of Allaah and the other is the right of the other person.

After studying the matter, the \r\n    Committee thinks that these shows should be banned and it is haraam to watch \r\n    them, finance them, take part in them, call them to vote or to express \r\n    admiration of them, because of what these shows include of allowing \r\n    forbidden things concerning which there is consensus that they are \r\n    forbidden, and doing so brazenly. According to the hadeeth, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There will be among my \r\n    ummah people who will regard as permissible zina (adultery), silk, alcohol \r\n    and musical instruments.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of Abu \r\n    Maalik al-Ash&rsquo;ari (may Allaah be pleased with him).

If the husband did not divorce her until after the mahr \r\n      was returned to him, this is khula&rsquo;, which is permissible in return for \r\n      the mahr, or more or less than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, your relative does not have to return the ten \r\n    thousand to her ex-husband, so long as they agreed that she can keep it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: If the woman attributed words or deeds to her \r\n    husband of which he was innocent, then this is a serious lie and is haraam. \r\n    What she has to do is to repent to Allaah and pray for her husband and for \r\n    forgiveness for him. She does not have to tell him about that or ask for his \r\n    forgiveness. The same applies to anyone who backbites or tells lies about \r\n    another person; it is not a condition of repentance that he should tell him \r\n    about that, because of the enmity and hatred that that may lead to.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>\r\n    al-Waabil al-Sayyib<\/i>, p. 219:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Chapter 56: What a \r\n    person who has gossiped about his Muslim brother should say:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) that the expiation for backbiting is to pray for \r\n    forgiveness for the one concerning whom you gossiped. You should say: O \r\n    Allaah, forgive us and him. This was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in <i>al-Da&rsquo;waat \r\n    al-Kabeer<\/i>, but he said there is some weakness in its isnaad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>There are two scholarly \r\n    opinions concerning this issue, both of which were narrated from Imam Ahmad. \r\n    The issue is: in repenting from backbiting is it sufficient to pray for \r\n    forgiveness for the one about whom you gossiped, or must you also tell him \r\n    and ask for his forgiveness?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that there is no need to tell him, rather \r\n    it is sufficient to pray for forgiveness and to speak of his good points in \r\n    the places where you gossiped about him. This is the view favoured by Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and others. Those who say that it is essential to tell \r\n    him regarded backbiting as being like financial rights, but the difference \r\n    between them is obvious. In the case of financial rights, the person who is \r\n    wronged benefits from the restoration of his rights; if he wishes he may \r\n    keep it and if he wishes he may give it in charity. But in the case of \r\n    backbiting, that is not possible and the only thing that results from \r\n    telling him is the opposite of what the Lawgiver seeks, for it will upset \r\n    him and hurt his feelings if he hears what was said about him, and it may \r\n    stir up enmity that can never be assuaged, and there is no point in that. So \r\n    the wise Lawgiver would never permit or allow it, let alone enjoin it or \r\n    command it. The aim of sharee&rsquo;ah is to reduce and eliminate evil, not stir \r\n    it up and make it worse. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Safaareeni said in <i>Sharh Manzoomah al-Adaab<\/i>, \r\n    2\/577.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abd al-Barr says in his book <i>Bahjat al-Majaalis<\/i>: \r\n    Hudhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The expiation of one who \r\n    has gossiped is to pray for forgiveness (for that person). &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    al-Mubaarak said: The way to repent from backbiting is to pray for \r\n    forgiveness for the one about whom you gossiped.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Adaab al-Kubra<\/i> something similar to what \r\n    Ibn al-Mubaarak said, and this was the view favoured by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen \r\n    and by Ibn al-Salaah al-Shaafa&rsquo;i in his fatwas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said, after mentioning the two reports \r\n    concerning this matter: every aspersion against a person&rsquo;s honour, whether \r\n    it is truthful or is a lie, comes under the heading of qadhaf (slander), \r\n    because qadhaf may be true, in which case it is gheebah (backbiting), or it \r\n    may be false, in which case it is buhtaan (lying). Our companions favoured \r\n    the view that the victim should not be told, rather du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; should be offered \r\n    for him, because telling him would cause more hurt and annoyance, and if a \r\n    person is harmed by knowing what has been said about him, that causes more \r\n    harm than if he does not know. Telling him leads to these two evils and \r\n    there is a third evil &ndash; even if it is true &ndash; which is the destruction of any \r\n    friendship that may have existed between them, or the renewal of enmity and \r\n    hatred. Allaah has enjoined us to unite and not to divide. This evil may be \r\n    worse in some cases than in others.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Those scholars who said \r\n    that it is essential to seek the forgiveness of the one who has been wronged \r\n    in this matter exempted the backbiter from having to do that if the victim \r\n    is dead or absent. In that case it is sufficient to pray for forgiveness for \r\n    him, make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; for him and do a lot of good deeds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi<\/i>, p. 308&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also question no.

Allaah \r\n    describes His slaves as follows (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious), when an \r\n    evil thought comes to them from Shaytaan (Satan), they remember (Allaah), \r\n    and (indeed) they then see (aright)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:201]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Try to follow the advice which the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave to young people, which is to get \r\n    married if you are able to. Do not pay any attention to the fact that you \r\n    are young, for being young is not a reason not to get married, far from it, \r\n    so long as you have the need to get married. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O young men, whoever among you can \r\n    afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering \r\n    the gaze and protecting chastity. Whoever cannot afford that should fast, \r\n    for it will be a shield for him.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, \r\n    1400). Strive to follow this advice from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), for this is the solution to your problem, \r\n    in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is nothing wrong with telling your father and mother of \r\n    your need and desire to get married; don&rsquo;t let shyness stop you from doing \r\n    that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Think seriously about marriage and do not fear poverty, and \r\n    Allaah will grant you independence of means by His bounty. Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who \r\n    has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon \r\n    (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants \r\n    (female slaves).

It was narrated from \r\n    Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There are three who \r\n    are entitled to Allaah&rsquo;s help: the mujaahid who fights for the sake of \r\n    Allaah, the slave who made a contract of manumission with his master, \r\n    wanting to buy his freedom, and the one who gets married, seeking chastity.&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1655; al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 3120; Ibn Maajah, 2518; classed \r\n    as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb wa&rsquo;l-Tarheeb<\/i>, 1917).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If it is not easy for you \r\n    to get married, then there is another solution, which is fasting. So why not \r\n    think of fasting three days of each month, or on Mondays and Thursdays?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How great is the reward of fasting. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that Allaah said, &ldquo;All the deeds \r\n    of the son of Adam are for him except for fasting, which is for Me and I \r\n    shall give reward for it.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1904; Muslim 1151).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah tells us that He has enjoined fasting on us so \r\n    that we might become pious:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;O you who believe! \r\n    Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed \r\n    for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:183]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fasting &ndash; as well as offering protection from following whims \r\n    and desires and bringing a great reward from Allaah &ndash; also trains a person \r\n    to have strong will, patience and forbearance, to rise above the desires and \r\n    pleasures of the self. So hasten to fast so that Allaah may make things \r\n    easier for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Beware of thinking little of looking at haraam things in \r\n    cheap magazines and nude pictures which lead to committing immoral actions \r\n    that doom a person to Hell, and have deep and bad effects on the heart &ndash; \r\n    Allaah&nbsp; forbid.

But he will do that because you gave in to him, even if that only \r\n    happened once. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sixthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Remember, when the idea of sin come to you, or the Shaytaan \r\n    whispers to you to commit a sin, that the parts of your body will bear \r\n    witness against you on the Day of Resurrection for this sin. Do you not know \r\n    that these limbs and this youthful energy are a blessing from Allaah to you? \r\n    So can it be an act of gratitude to Allaah that you use them to disobey \r\n    Allaah and rebel against the commands of Allaah?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is another matter which you should pay attention to. \r\n    Read with me the following verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Till, when they reach it (Hell-fire), their hearing \r\n    (ears) and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what \r\n    they used to do.<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;And they will say to \r\n    their skins, &lsquo;Why do you testify against us?&rsquo; They will say: &lsquo;Allaah has \r\n    caused us to speak.&rsquo; <!--[if supportFields]>SYMBOL 190 f &quot;Symbol&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><![endif]--> \r\n    He causes all things to speak, and He created you the first time, and to Him \r\n    you are made to return&rdquo;<br>\r\n    [Fussilat 41:20-21]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: &ldquo;We were with the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he \r\n    smiled and said, &lsquo;Do you know why I am smiling?&rsquo; We said, &lsquo;Allaah and His \r\n    Messenger know best.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Because of how a person will address his \r\n    Lord. He will say, &lsquo;O Lord, did You not guarantee me protection against \r\n    injustice?&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;I do not deem valid any \r\n    witness against me but my own self.&rsquo; Allaah will say, &lsquo;Your own self will be \r\n    sufficient as a witness against you this Day, and the honourable scribes \r\n    (recording angels) will also bear witness.&rsquo; Then a seal will be placed over \r\n    his mouth and it will be said to his limbs, &lsquo;Speak!&rsquo; And they will speak of \r\n    his deeds.

Try to fill your time with things that will benefit you, such as \r\n    doing righteous deeds, reading Qur&rsquo;aan, dhikr and prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eighthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Avoid keeping company with evil and immoral people who \r\n    discuss these subjects, talk about things that provoke desire, take the \r\n    matter of sin lightly and encourage it. You have to look for good friends \r\n    who will remind you of Allaah and help you to obey Him. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;A man will follow the \r\n    religion of his close friend, so be careful about who you make friends \r\n    with.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2378; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>\r\n    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>, 1937).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ninthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If it so happens that you \r\n    fall into sin in a moment of weakness, do not persist in that, rather be \r\n    quick to repent to Allaah, lest you become one of those of whom Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;And those who, when \r\n    they have committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged \r\n    themselves with evil, remember Allaah and ask forgiveness for their sins; &mdash; \r\n    and none can forgive sins but Allaah &mdash; and do not persist in what (wrong) \r\n    they have done, while they know&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:135]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    My brother, do not despair of the mercy of Allaah.

Nameemah means \r\n    telling some people what others have said about them in order to cause \r\n    trouble among them. This is the most common definition of nameemah. Ibn \r\n    Hajar al-Haythami narrated it in his book <i>al-Zawaajir &lsquo;an Iqtiraaf \r\n    al-Kabaa&rsquo;ir<\/i>, then he said: &ldquo;It says in <i>al-Ihya&rsquo;<\/i>: it is not \r\n    limited to that, rather it refers to disclosure of anything that may hurt or \r\n    offend somebody if it is disclosed, whether it is the person who is spoken \r\n    about who is offended, or the person who hears the gossip, or a third party, \r\n    whether it is disclosed verbally, in writing or by means of a hint or a \r\n    gesture, and whether what is transmitted is an action, a word, a fault or a \r\n    shortcoming in the person who is being talked about, or in someone else. The \r\n    definition of nameemah is uncovering secrets and disclosing that which it is \r\n    not appropriate to disclose. Hence we should keep silent and refrain from \r\n    telling everything that we see of people&rsquo;s situations, unless speaking of it \r\n    will bring some benefit to a Muslim or ward off some harm. For example, if \r\n    you see a person taking someone else&rsquo;s property, you have to bear witness to \r\n    that, in contrast to if you see someone hiding his own money, in which case \r\n    speaking of it would be nameemah and disclosing a person&rsquo;s secrets. If what \r\n    is spoken of is a fault or shortcoming in the person of whom one speaks, \r\n    then this is gheebah (backbiting) and nameemah (malicious gossip).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (<i>al-Zawaajir<\/i>, no. 252: <i>al-Nameemah<\/i>)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated that \r\n    al-Haafiz al-Mundhiri said: &ldquo;The ummah is unanimously agreed that nameemah \r\n    is forbidden and that it is one of the greatest sins in the sight of \r\n    Allaah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From this we know that your passing on to your boss what your \r\n    colleagues say is a kind of disclosing secrets and creating mischief and \r\n    falling into this major sin, in addition to it being spying, which is \r\n    haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are many texts which condemn nameemah and spying and \r\n    seeking out people&rsquo;s faults, which will deter the Muslim from committing \r\n    these haraam actions:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;No person who spreads nameemah will enter Paradise.&rdquo; According \r\n    to another report, &ldquo;No eavesdropper (qattaat)&hellip;&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, \r\n    6056; Muslim, 105.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A qattaat is someone who \r\n    spreads nameemah.

Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allaah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (al-tayyibaat, al-halaal) and evil or prohibited (al-khabaa'ith, al-haraam), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) in surat al-A'raaf (7:157):\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"And He makes good things halaal for them and bad things haraam.\" <\/i>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nConsidering this fact, smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being. Allah said (interpretation of meaning):\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you.\" (Surat al-Nisaa' 4:29)<\/i>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, His Prophet <img>\r\n SAWS (peace be upon him) said:\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islaam).\" (Arabic \"laa darar wa laa diraar\") <\/i>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n   He SAWS (peace be upon him) also said:\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ... his body as to what he engaged it in.\" <\/i>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n   Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet <img>\r\n SAWS:\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"Your body has a right on you.\"<\/i>\r\n<\/LI>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<li>There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for the health of others who inhale the polluted breath  of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The offensive smell caused by smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of  Allah among humans and angels. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin.\" (Surat al-Ahzaab, 33:58) <\/i>\r\n<\/p><\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance.

Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan.\" (Surat al-Israa' 17:26-27) <\/i>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nExtravagance (in Islam) means spending on something haraam.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSpending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet <img>\r\n SAWS (peace be upon him) said:\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ..... what he owned as to how he spent it.\" <\/i>\r\n<\/LI>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nConsidering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others. It is not permissible to indulge in it, or buy and sell it, or even to offer it to others. It is incumbent on a person who is addicted to it that he must make all efforts and get whatever necessary treatment to stop it.  If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up.

The fact that Allaah \r\n          conceals it implies that the believer must also cover himself. Whoever \r\n          deliberately flaunts his sin angers his Lord, Who will not then cover \r\n          him. Whoever deliberately conceals his sin out of shame before his Lord \r\n          and before people, Allaah will bless him by concealing it. <\/span> \r\n          <span><i>(<span>Fath \r\n          al-Baari<\/span>, 10\/487-488) <\/i><\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><span>&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>al-Mannaawi said:<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p><span>&nbsp; \r\n          What is meant is those who talk openly to one another about their sins. \r\n          Ibn Jamaa&rsquo;ah included in this disclosure of what happens between husband \r\n          and wife of permissible things. This is supported by the famous report \r\n          which warns against that: &ldquo;It is part of flaunting one&rsquo;s sins&rdquo; &ndash; i.e., \r\n          speaking openly about them and broadcasting them &ndash; &ldquo;that a man should \r\n          do an evil deed at night, then the following morning, when Allaah had \r\n          covered him, he says, &lsquo;Last night I did such and such&rsquo; &ndash; when all night \r\n          his Lord had concealed his sin, but in the morning he uncovers what \r\n          Allaah had concealed.&rdquo; &ndash; by telling people about his sin. This is a \r\n          betrayal on his part of the covering of Allaah which had been lowered \r\n          upon him, and a provocation of the desire for evil in the people who \r\n          hear him or see him. So these are two offences which are added to his \r\n          original offence and make it worse. If in addition to that he encourages \r\n          others to do likewise, this is a fourth offence that makes the matter \r\n          even worse&hellip; The implication is that they have no sins unless they flaunt \r\n          them, then he explained that the one who flaunts his sin is the one \r\n          who does something at night and his Lord conceals it, then in the morning \r\n          he says, &lsquo;O So-and-so, last night I did such and such,&rsquo; so he removes \r\n          the covering of Allaah. He is to be condemned in this world by carrying \r\n          out the hadd punishment, for it is among the attributes and blessings \r\n          of Allaah that He brings forth what is beautiful and conceals what is \r\n          ugly. So openly flaunting sin is a rejection of that blessing and disrespect \r\n          towards the concealment of Allaah. Al-Nawawi said: It is makrooh for \r\n          the person who is tested with sin to tell anyone else about it. Rather \r\n          he should give it up, regret it and resolve not to do it again. If he \r\n          tells his shaykh or a similar person who he hopes can teach him a way \r\n          out from it or show him how to keep himself from falling into similar \r\n          sins, or can tell him the reason why he fell into it, or make du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n          for him, etc., this is fine. But is it makrooh (to tell someone else) \r\n          if there is no benefit in doing so. Al-Ghazaali said: The kind of disclosure \r\n          which is blameworthy is when it is in done by way of openly flaunting \r\n          sin and mocking, not when it is done to ask questions and seek fatwas. \r\n          The evidence for saying this is the report of the man who had intercourse \r\n          with his wife in Ramadaan, and he came and told the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who did not rebuke him \r\n          for telling him.

Calling favours that go against sharee&rsquo;ah &ldquo;human services&rdquo; is in\r\n    fact a misnomer, because anything that goes against sharee&rsquo;ah is a bestial action.\r\n    This is why Allaah described the kuffaar and mushrikeen as being like cattle. He says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;&hellip; while those who disbelieve enjoy\r\n    themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire will be their abode.&rdquo; [Muhammad 47:12]<\/i>\r\n    and <i>&ldquo;&hellip;They are only like cattle; - nay, they are even farther astray from the\r\n    Path&hellip;&rdquo; [al-Furqaan 25:44]<\/i>.

Except \r\nfrom their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, \r\nthey are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the \r\ntransgressors.&quot;<\/em> 23.5-7 Here the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts \r\n(including masturbation) except for the wives or that their right hand possess. And \r\nwhoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.<\/p>\r\n<em>&quot;And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, \r\nuntil Allah enriches them of His bounty.&quot;<\/em> 24.33. This verse also clearly orders whoever \r\ndoes not have the financial means to marry to keep himself chaste and be patient in \r\nfacing temptations (including masturbation) until Allah enriches them of His bounty.<\/p>\r\nSecondly, from the sunnah of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him): <\/p>\r\nAbdullaah ibn Mas&#146;ood said, &quot;We were with the Prophet while we were young and had \r\nno wealth whatsoever. So Allaah&#146;s Messenger said, <em>&quot;O young people! Whoever among \r\nyou can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his \r\nmodesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and \r\nwhoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.&quot;<\/em> \r\nBukhari:5066. The hadeeth orders men who are not able to marry to fast despite the \r\nhardship encountered in doing so, and not to masturbate despite the ease with which it \r\ncan be done.<\/p>\r\nThere are additional evidences that can be cited to support this ruling on masturbation, \r\nbut due to the limited space we will not go through them here. Allaah knows what is best \r\nand most correct. <\/p>\r\nAs for curing the habit of masturbation, we recommend the following suggestions:<\/p>\r\n1) The motive to seek a cure for this problem should be solely following Allaah&#146;s orders \r\nand fearing His punishment.<\/p>\r\n2) A permanent and quick cure from this problem lies in marriage as soon as the person \r\nis able, as shown in the Prophet&#146;s <img>\r\n hadeeth.<\/p>\r\n3) Keeping oneself busy with what is good for this world and the hereafter is essential in \r\nbreaking this habit before it becomes second nature after which it is very difficult to rid \r\noneself of it.<\/p>\r\n4) Lowering the gaze (from looking at forbidden things such as pictures, movies etc.) \r\nwill help suppress the desire before it leads one to commit the haraam (forbidden). \r\nAllaah orders men and women to lower their gaze as shown in the following two verses \r\nand in the Prophet&#146;s <img>\r\n hadeeth (interpretations of the meanings):<\/p>\r\n<em>&quot;Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and \r\nprotect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, \r\nAllah is all-aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze \r\n(from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual \r\nacts, etc.) ..... &quot;<\/em> 24.30-31 <\/p>\r\nAllaah&#146;s messenger said: <em>&quot;Do not follow a casual (unintentional) look (at forbidden \r\nthings) with another look.&quot;<\/em> Al-Tirmidhi 2777. This is a general instruction by the \r\nProphet <img>\r\n to abstain from all that may sexually excite a person because it might lead \r\nhim\/her to commit the haraam (forbidden).<\/p>\r\n5) Using one&#146;s available leisure time in worshipping Allaah and increasing religious \r\nknowledge.<\/p>\r\n6) Being cautious not to develop any of the medical symptoms that may result from \r\nmasturbation such as weak eyesight, weak nervous system, and\/or back pain. More \r\nimportantly, feeling of guilt and anxiety that can be complicated by missing obligatory \r\nprayers because of the need to shower (ghusl) after every incidence of masturbation.<\/p>\r\n7) Avoiding the illusion that some youth have that masturbation is permissible because it \r\nprevents them from committing illegal sexual acts such as fornication or even \r\nhomosexuality.<\/p>\r\n8) Strengthening one&#146;s willpower and avoiding spending time alone as recommended by \r\nthe Prophet <img>\r\n when he said <em>&quot;Do not spend the night alone&quot;<\/em> Ahmad 6919.<\/p>\r\n9) Following the Prophet&#146;s <img>\r\n aforementioned hadeeth and fast when possible, because \r\nfasting will temper one&#146;s sexual desire and keep it under control. However, one should \r\nnot overreact and swear by Allaah not to return to the act because if one does not honor \r\none&#146;s promise, one would be facing the consequences of not living up to one&#146;s oath to \r\nAllaah. Also, note that medication to diminish one&#146;s sexual desire is strictly prohibited \r\nbecause it might permanently affect one&#146;s sexual ability.<\/p>\r\n10) Trying to follow the Prophet&#146;s <img>\r\n recommendation concerning the etiquette of \r\ngetting ready for bed, such as reading well-known supplications, sleeping on the right \r\nside, and avoiding sleeping on the belly (the Prophet <img>\r\n forbade sleeping on the belly).<\/p>\r\n11) Striving hard to be patient and chaste, because persistence will eventually, Allaah \r\nwilling, lead to attaining those qualities as second nature, as the Prophet <img>\r\n explains in \r\nthe following hadeeth:<br>\r\n<em>&quot;Whoever seeks chastity Allaah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks help from \r\nnone but Allaah, He will help him, and whoever is patient He will make it easy for him, \r\nand no one has ever been given anything better than patience.&quot;<\/em> Bukhari:1469.<\/p>\r\n12) Repenting, asking forgiveness from Allaah, doing good deeds, and not losing hope \r\nand feeling despair are all prerequisites to curing this problem. Note that losing hope is \r\none of the major sins punishable by Allaah.<\/p>\r\n13) Finally, Allaah is the Most Merciful and He always responds to whoever calls on \r\nHim. So, asking for Allah&#146;s forgiveness will be accepted, by His will.<\/p>\r\nWallahu a&#146;lam.

Whatever the case, the best option is to refer these \r\n    people to the zakaah and charity committees so that they can do their job of \r\n    finding out about their circumstances and follow up on them even after \r\n    giving to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you realise that someone is not in need or you think it \r\n    most likely that this is the case, then do not give him anything. If you \r\n    realise that he is in need or you think it most likely that this is the \r\n    case, then give him something if you want to. If you see someone and it is \r\n    not clear to you what his situation really is, then you may give him or you \r\n    may not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person gives something to someone to whom it is \r\n    permissible to give, thinking that he is in need, he will have the reward \r\n    for that act of charity even if it turns out later that he was not in need, \r\n    and even if the money he gave him was the zakaah of his wealth. It will be \r\n    accepted from him and he does not have to give it again.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with \r\n    him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;A man said: I shall certainly give charity. He went out with his \r\n    charity and placed it in the hand of a thief. The next morning, they said: \r\n    He gave charity to a thief. He said: O Allah, praise be to You; I shall \r\n    certainly give charity (again). He went out with his charity and placed it \r\n    in the hands of a prostitute. The next morning they said: Last night he gave \r\n    charity to a prostitute. He said: O Allaah, praise be to You for a \r\n    prostitute. I shall certainly give charity (again).&rsquo; He went out with his \r\n    charity and placed it in the hand of a rich man. The next morning, they \r\n    said, Last night he gave charity to a rich man. He said: O Allaah, to You be \r\n    praise for a thief, a prostitute and a rich man. It was said to him: As for \r\n    what you gave in charity to a thief, perhaps it will be the cause of his \r\n    refraining from stealing; as for the prostitute, perhaps it will be the \r\n    cause of her refraining from fornication; and as for the rich man, perhaps \r\n    he will learn a lesson and spend from that which Allaah has given him.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1355; Muslim, 1022&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person thinks it most likely that the one to whom he \r\n    gave charity was entitled to zakaah, that is acceptable, whether he was \r\n    begging or he looked poor. It is acceptable even if it turns out later on \r\n    that he was independent of means; it is still acceptable. Hence when the man \r\n    gave charity to the rich man and the next morning the people were saying \r\n    &ldquo;Last night he gave charity to a rich man,&rdquo; it was said to the one who had \r\n    given charity and regretted giving it to the rich man, &ldquo;as for what you gave \r\n    in charity to the rich man, it has been accepted.&rdquo; Allah, may He be \r\n    glorified and exalted does not burden any soul with more than it can bear \r\n    and He does not oblige you to try to find out about a person so that you can \r\n    be absolutely certain. This is something that is not possible, or is too \r\n    difficult. If you think it most likely that this is a person who is entitled \r\n    to zakaah, then give to him, and if it turns out that he is not one of those \r\n    who are entitled to it, your zakaah is still acceptable, praise be to \r\n    Allah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>al-Liqa&rsquo; ash-Shahri<\/i>, 71\/question \r\n    no. 9&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]5154[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]46241[\\fatin]<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4073","question_id":"4073","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible for a man to be alone with a woman or \r\n    teenage girl who is desirable, whether that is for a private lesson or \r\n    anything else, in the home or elsewhere, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No man is alone with a woman but the \r\n    shaytaan is the third one present.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2165); classed \r\n    as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;No man should be alone with a woman unless her mahram is present.&rdquo; Narrated \r\n    by al-Bukhaari (3006) and Muslim (1341).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by &ldquo;being alone&rdquo; is their being in a place \r\n    where no one else can see them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The stories which one hears about male teachers and female \r\n    students are very disgraceful, and mean that the girl&rsquo;s guardian must be \r\n    even more careful and cautious.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason for that &ndash; and Allaah knows best &ndash; is that the \r\n    girl is usually young, at the stage of adolescence, when desire is strong, \r\n    and it is easy to deceive her, and she does not have enough common sense or \r\n    experience to be able to understand things properly and control her desires. \r\n    Moreover, lengthy interaction between the teacher and student, if it goes on \r\n    for a year or more, will gradually reduce the shyness and modesty between \r\n    them, which will make it easier to fall into that which Allaah has \r\n    forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who finds that he needs to bring a teacher for his \r\n    daughter must make sure that someone sits with them during the lesson, such \r\n    as her brother, or he should make sure that the lesson is given in an open area of the house, such as the sitting room, for example, and not in a closed room.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4074","question_id":"4074","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Masturbation, or what is called the secret habit, is haraam \r\n    because of the evidence which has been explained in the answer to question \r\n    number [fatin]329[\\fatin].

You are \r\n\tthe one who has been writing these sinful love letters for your mother; you \r\n\thave been concealing this from your father and have even lied to him, \r\n\ttelling him that nothing is going on; you did not advise your uncle to \r\n\trefrain from doing haraam things, namely going against the teachings of his \r\n\treligion and betraying his brother. You did not confront your mother frankly \r\n\tand make her give up this foolish and haraam action &#8211; in fact you regarded \r\n\ther action and her justification for it as just an opinion, as opposed to \r\n\tyour opinion that her action is not justified, when in fact the issue is one \r\n\tof whims and desires as opposed to a shar&#8216;i ruling. You even tried to spare \r\n\ther feelings so that she would not be upset if you refused to do her bidding \r\n\tand write haraam letters to your uncle and correspond with him in her name.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>All of that \r\n\tleads us to fear that you are the most sinful of all the individuals \r\n\tinvolved. You could have put a stop to this evil immediately, by confronting \r\n\tyour mother and telling her frankly that what she is doing is haraam, that \r\n\tit is not permissible for her to carry on with it, that her justifications \r\n\tfor it are not acceptable in terms of either sharee&#8216;ah or reasoning, and \r\n\tthat you would inform your father if she continued this sinful relationship \r\n\twith your uncle. You could also have put a stop to this evil by confronting \r\n\tyour uncle with his evil deeds and telling him that a person like him could \r\n\tnot be entrusted with people&#8217;s honour; by threatening him that if he \r\n\tcontinued this action, you would tell your father about what he is doing and \r\n\tyou would prevent him from entering your house. You could also have put an \r\n\tend to this evil by telling your father about the details of the matter so \r\n\tthat he could do what Allah has enjoined upon him of advising his family \r\n\tmembers. We do not advise you to tell your father unless your mother or your \r\n\tuncle persist in this sinful relationship between them. If they give up that \r\n\trelationship then there is no need to tell your father about it. But if they \r\n\tpersist in it &#8211; or if one of them persists &#8211; then you do not have the option \r\n\tof remaining silent; rather you must &#8211; whilst also continuing to advise and \r\n\texhort them &#8211; tell your father so that he can put a stop to this sinful \r\n\trelationship, even if that leads to him divorcing his wife or cutting off \r\n\tties with his brother and banning him from entering his house.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>We are \r\n\tdoubtful about your saying that your father knows about your mother&#8217;s \r\n\trelationship with your uncle and that the matter is out of his hands. If we \r\n\tassume that the matter is as you say, and that your father knows what is \r\n\treally going on between his wife and his brother, but he is keeping quiet \r\n\tabout it and is not doing what the situation requires, then this is a case \r\n\tof cuckoldry. He has the power to advise his wife, or to shun her, or to hit \r\n\ther; he also has the power to ban his brother from entering his house, or to \r\n\tcut off communications in his house. What makes us doubt that he knows about \r\n\tthis relationship is the fact that your mother has been trying to conceal it \r\n\tfrom him, and he asks you and you deny it. As for his stress, it may be an \r\n\tindication of his doubt; it does not indicate that he knows what is really \r\n\tgoing on, especially since you say that your mother does not talk to him \r\n\tface-to-face when he visits you. We are certain that if he knew about this \r\n\tharaam relationship, he would act as is befitting for the head of a \r\n\treligiously committed family, as you claim to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>One of the \r\n\tclear rulings of sharee&#8216;ah is that it is haraam to cooperate and help in sin \r\n\tand transgression, or to obey if doing so involves sin. There is no \r\n\tobedience to anyone if it involves disobedience towards Allah, even if the \r\n\tone who is issuing these orders is a mother or father; rather obedience is \r\n\tonly in that which is right and proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Allah, may \r\n\tHe be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n\t<p><i>&#8220;Help you \r\n\tone another in Al&#8209;Birr and At&#8209;Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but \r\n\tdo not help one another in sin and transgression.

We are certain that your answer will \r\n    be: No, I could not do that, no matter what levels my desire reached. Is \r\n    that not the case? Well, do you know that you are doing it before the Lord \r\n    of the heavens and the earth?! Do you know that the Creator of the universe \r\n    can see you when you are doing it?

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;O young men, whoever among you can afford it, \r\n    let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and \r\n    guarding one&rsquo;s chastity.

This is something \r\n    natural which all men and women see. There is nothing wrong with it and \r\n    there is no sin on a person because of that. It was narrated in the hadeeth \r\n    of Umm Sulaym that she asked the Prophet of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) about a woman who sees in her dream what a man sees. \r\n    The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;If a woman sees that she should do ghusl.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, <i>\r\n    al-Hayd<\/i>, 469)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Erotic dreams are beyond \r\n    a person&rsquo;s control and he has no power to prevent them. Rather is a means of \r\n    the body ridding itself of excess material that may harm it if it remains in \r\n    the body. Hence sometimes a person may see something in his sleep, and \r\n    sometimes he may not see anything but still experience nocturnal emissions. \r\n    Hence it is not haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets \r\n    reward for that (good) which he has earned&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:286]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to masturbation, it is haraam because it happens \r\n    by a person&rsquo;s intention and will. See the answer to question 329.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to looking at women, because this happens by \r\n    a person&rsquo;s choice and intention, and he does it deliberately. Hence it is \r\n    not allowed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because a person is unable to prevent a sudden glance, he \r\n    will not be brought to account for that, rather the sin is in following it \r\n    with another glance. It says in the hadeeth: &ldquo;O &lsquo;Ali, do not follow one \r\n    glance with another, for you are allowed the first but not the second.&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, <i>al-Adab<\/i>, 2701; classed as hasan by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>, no. 2229). What is meant by &ldquo;you \r\n    are allowed the first&rdquo; is if that does not happen intentionally, and &ldquo;but \r\n    not the second&rdquo; means because it is done by your own choice, so it is a sin \r\n    on you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has commanded the believers to lower their gaze. \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking \r\n    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual \r\n    acts)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Noor 24:30]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also commanded likewise. It \r\n    was narrated that Jareer said: &ldquo;I asked the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a sudden look. He said, &lsquo;Avert \r\n    your gaze.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Nikaah, 1836; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, no. 1880. Hence it is obligatory to \r\n    obey the command of Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;And let those who \r\n    oppose the Messenger&rsquo;s (Muhammad&rsquo;s) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah <\/i>\r\n    <!--[if supportFields]><i>SYMBOL 190 f \r\n    &quot;Symbol&quot;<\/i><![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><![endif]--><i> \r\n    legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, \r\n    lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, \r\n    overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be \r\n    inflicted on them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p><i>[al-Noor 24:63]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What people should know and believe is that Allaah does not \r\n    burden people with things that are too difficult for them or impose hardship \r\n    upon them. He does not enjoin any impossible commands. This includes \r\n    lowering the gaze, for it is within a person&rsquo;s reach to obey this command.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But because the way to Paradise is lined with difficult \r\n    things and the way to Hell is lined with whims and desires, Allaah has made \r\n    this a test and a trial for His slaves. So whoever obeys the command of \r\n    Allaah and keeps away from that which Allaah has forbidden, the consequences \r\n    will be good for him and he will have a good Hereafter. And the converse \r\n    also applies (i.e., one who goes against Allaah&rsquo;s commands will have bad \r\n    consequences).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has commanded us to lower our gaze and has forbidden \r\n    us to look at women because of the great evil and mischief that result from \r\n    that. For looking is the harbinger of zina (unlawful sexual relationships) &ndash; \r\n    Allaah forbid. Hence it says in the hadeeth that Allaah has decreed for the \r\n    son of Adam his share of zina, which will inevitably catch up with him, and \r\n    the zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking; the \r\n    heart wishes and hopes and the private parts confirm that or deny it.&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, <i>al-Qadar<\/i>, 6122). So if a person lowers his \r\n    gaze and refrains from looking at that which Allaah has forbidden, how could \r\n    he be motivated to commit immoral actions? What the Muslim must do is to \r\n    keep away from everything that may lead to immorality, whether that is \r\n    looking at women, or thinking thoughts that provoke and increase desire. \r\n    Whoever does those things will only make more worry and distress for \r\n    himself, to no avail.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;As the poet said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;&ldquo;If you let your gaze wander, this will cause you a lot of \r\n    heartache.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You will see things that you will desire but you are unable \r\n    to acquire them, yet you are unable to bear that with patience.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;&ldquo;How many looks have been fatal to the heart of the one who \r\n    looked,<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    as fatal as an arrow, but with no bow and no string.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;And it was said that being patient in lowering one's gaze is \r\n    easier than trying to put up with the pain that comes afterwards.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;We ask Allaah to guide us all.

The lesbian&#146;s testimony is \r\nunacceptable because she is a evildoer (al-Mawsoo&#146;ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 24\/253). <\/p>\r\nIbn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;If two women masturbate one another, \r\nthen they are cursed fornicators&quot; (al-Mughni 10\/162).

For this reason, marriage has been\r\n    prescribed, and fornication, adultery, sodomy and lesbianism have been forbidden. All the\r\n    things that may lead to the above have also been forbidden, such as looking at non-mahram\r\n    women (women to whom one is not closely related), mixing with them or being alone with\r\n    them. Dressing improperly and forming friendships with the opposite sex have also been\r\n    forbidden. All of this is aimed at preventing the provocation of desires, and at directing\r\n    desires into legitimate channels instead of letting them find forbidden means of\r\n    expression. One of the principles of sharee&#146;ah is that whatever leads to haraam deeds\r\n    is itself haraam, so everything that leads to the provocation of haraam desires is haraam,\r\n    because it may lead to a person falling into fornication and adultery. Once desire has\r\n    been provoked, it invariably means that a person has to find a way of satisfying it, and\r\n    so he or she commits a haraam act. Reading stories and magazines with sexual content, and\r\n    looking at dirty pictures and movies provokes these kinds of desires and leads to haraam\r\n    deeds, so they are not allowed. We should avoid them and keep away from them.

Allaah knows that this leads to haraam things whether it is\r\n    immoral actions of varying decrees or falling in love &ndash; which is the serious and\r\n    fatal disease from which you are suffering because of your sin. You have become one of its\r\n    victims, suffering its pain and choking on it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>You have been very frank in describing this disease from its onset, and\r\n    how you fell into this devilish trap, when you said in your question: &ldquo;I have met a\r\n    wonderful Muslim girl six months ago... We talked for many months and have become very\r\n    close. Actually we are in love with each other.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>But you mention that you feel that Allaah has led you to one another.\r\n    If you mean that this has happened by the will and decree of Allaah, then this is correct.\r\n    Even Iblees exists by the will and decree of Allaah. But if you meant that Allaah decreed\r\n    this because He likes it and approves of it, (this is wrong, because) Allaah does not\r\n    approve of anything that is haraam. Just because something happens does not mean that\r\n    Allaah likes it or approves of it. Allaah decrees good and evil for reasons which only He\r\n    knows.<\/p>\r\n    <p>If you say now that what has happened has happened, and cannot be\r\n    changed, so what can we do about this father who is standing in the way of these two\r\n    lovers who want to get married?<\/p>\r\n    <p>I would say that there is nothing wrong with making efforts &ndash; in\r\n    halaal ways, of course &ndash; to persuade this father, such as bringing mediators from\r\n    within the family, or the imaam of the Islamic Centre where the father goes, and so on,\r\n    and praying earnestly to Allaah to make this girl part of your lot in life if this is good\r\n    for you and for her. If what you want happens, then praise be to Allaah, Who is the Giver\r\n    of bounty and blessings.<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if all attempts fail, mediation does not work and the wind blows in\r\n    the way that the sailor does not like (i.e., things do not go the way you hoped), then you\r\n    should know that from the point of view of sharee&rsquo;ah you can never marry this girl\r\n    without the consent of her guardian &ndash; which is her father in the case &ndash; because\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Any woman who gets\r\n    married without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is\r\n    invalid, her marriage is invalid.&rdquo; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1102, and by\r\n    Abu Dawood, Ahmad and Ibn Maajah.

What is the attitude of your own family\r\n    to the idea of your marrying this girl?<\/p>\r\n    <p>Finally, you must realize that you will have to forget about her if she\r\n    marries someone else. In that case, you should not waste your life regretting losing her.\r\n    You never know where good may come from. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;&hellip; it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for\r\n    you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you.

My entrance took her by surprise and I was very embarrassed as\r\n      a result.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I had to do an experiment in the lab at university,\r\n      but I was absent on the day of the experiment. I had to go to the lab on\r\n      the following day, and I found myself the only male among a group of\r\n      female students, in addition to a female teacher and a female lab\r\n      technician. I was very embarrassed and felt very awkward with all those\r\n      female eyes glaring at me.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I was trying to take a feminine towel out of one of\r\n      the drawers when I was surprised by a male colleague standing behind me,\r\n      who wanted to take something from his own private drawer. He noticed that\r\n      I was embarrassed and he left the room quickly to avoid my embarrassment.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>It so happened that one of the girls at the\r\n      university bumped into me when turning a corner in a crowded corridor. She\r\n      was walking quickly, going to one of the lectures. As a result of this\r\n      collision, she lost her balance, and I caught her in my arms, as if I was\r\n      embracing her. You can imagine how embarrassed I and this girl felt in\r\n      front of a group of careless young people.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>One of my female colleagues fell on the stairs in the\r\n      university and her clothes fell open in an extremely embarrassing fashion.\r\n      She landed upside down and could not help herself; the young men standing\r\n      nearby had no option but to cover her and help her to get up.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I work in a company and I went in to give some papers\r\n      to my boss. When I was going out, my boss called me back. I turned around\r\n      and saw him with his face turned away. I was waiting for him to ask me for\r\n      a file or for more papers, and I was surprised by his hesitancy. I turned\r\n      away to the left side of his office, pretending to be busy with something,\r\n      and he spoke to me at the same time. I thought that this boss would say\r\n      anything except what he actually said, which was to point out that my\r\n      garment was stained with menstrual blood. Can the earth open up and\r\n      swallow a human being at the moment of making sincere supplication? For I\r\n      prayed that the earth would open up and swallow me.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big><u>Victims of mixing&#8230; True stories<\/u>&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>Lost hope&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>Umm Muhammad, a mature woman over the age of 40,\r\n      tells her story.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I lived a life of modest means with my husband. There\r\n      was never any closeness and harmony, and my husband did not have the kind\r\n      of strong personality that a woman would hope for, but his good nature\r\n      made me overlook the fact that I was the one who was responsible for most\r\n      of the decision making in the family.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>My husband often used to mention the name of his\r\n      friend and business partner, and he would talk about him in my presence,\r\n      and I often used to meet with him in his office which was originally part\r\n      of our apartment. This went on for many years, until circumstances led to\r\n      us exchanging visits with this person and his family. These family visits\r\n      were repeated and because of his close friendship with my husband, we did\r\n      not notice how the number of visits increased and how many hours a single\r\n      visit would last. He often used to come on his own to sit with us, me and\r\n      my husband, for long visits. My husband&#8217;s trust in him knew no bounds,\r\n      and as days passed I got to know this person very well, and saw how\r\n      wonderful and decent he was.<span>&nbsp; <\/span>I\r\n      began to feel a strong attraction towards this man, and at the same time I\r\n      began to sense that the feeling was mutual.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Things took a strange turn after that, when I\r\n      realized that this man was the kind of person I had always dreamed about.\r\n      Why had he come along now, after all these years? The more this man&#8217;s\r\n      status increased in my eyes, the more my husband&#8217;s status diminished. It\r\n      was as if I had needed to see the beauty of his character in order to\r\n      discover how ugly my husband&#8217;s character was.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;The matter between this person and myself did\r\n      not go beyond these persistent thoughts which were occupying my mind night\r\n      and day. Neither he nor I ever voiced what we felt in our hearts&#8230; until\r\n      today. Yet despite that my life is over and my husband is little more than\r\n      a weak man with no self-esteem. I hate him and I do not know how all this\r\n      hatred towards him started to boil over. I wonder how I put up with him\r\n      all these years, bearing all these burdens by myself, facing life&#8217;s\r\n      problems on my own.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Things got so bad that I asked him for a\r\n      divorce, and he divorced me at my request. After that he became a broken\r\n      man. Even worse than that is that after my marriage was wrecked and my\r\n      children and husband were devastated, problems arose in this man's family.\r\n      His wife, with her feminine intuition, realized what had been going on in\r\n      his heart of hearts, and his life became hell. She was overwhelmed with\r\n      jealousy to the extent that one night she left her house at 2 a.m. and\r\n      came to attack my house, screaming, weeping and hurling accusations. His\r\n      marriage was also about to collapse.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;I admit that the lovely gatherings which we\r\n      used to enjoy gave us the opportunity to get to know one another at a time\r\n      that was not appropriate at this stage in our lives.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>His marriage has been wrecked and so has mine. I have\r\n      lost everything, and now I know that my circumstances and his will not\r\n      permit us to take any positive step towards coming together. Now I am more\r\n      miserable than I have ever been, and I am looking for illusionary\r\n      happiness and lost hopes.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Tit-for-tat<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Umm Ahmad tells us:<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;My husband had a group of married friends, and\r\n      because of our close friendship with them, we used to get together with\r\n      them once a week in one of our houses, to enjoy an evening of chat.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Deep down in my heart I was never really\r\n      comfortable with the atmosphere in which we would have dinner, sweets,\r\n      snacks and drinks of juice accompanied by waves of laughter because of the\r\n      jokes and chit-chats that often went beyond the bounds of good manners.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>In the name of friendship, the barriers were lifted\r\n      and every now and then one would hear suppressed laughter between a woman\r\n      and the husband of another woman. The jokes were too much, dealing &#8211;\r\n      with no sense of shyness &#8211;with sensitive topics such as sex and\r\n      women&#8217;s private matters. This was usual and was even accepted and\r\n      regarded as desirable.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Although I indulged in these things along with\r\n      them, my conscience made me feel guilty. Then the day came when it became\r\n      quite clear just how ugly and filthy this atmosphere was.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;The telephone rang, and I heard the voice of\r\n      one of the friends in this group. I said hello to him and apologized that\r\n      my husband was not home. He replied that he knew that, and that he was\r\n      calling to speak to me! After he suggested starting a relationship with\r\n      me, I got very angry and spoke harshly to him and cursed him. All he could\r\n      do was laugh and say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t try and show these good manners to me; go\r\n      and check on your husband&#8217;s good manners and see what he is doing&#8230;&#8221;\r\n      I was devastated by what he said, but I pulled myself together and said to\r\n      myself, this person is only trying to cause the break up of your marriage.\r\n      But he succeeded in planting the seeds of doubt concerning my husband.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>Shortly after that, the major disaster struck. I\r\n      discovered that my husband was cheating on me with another woman. It was\r\n      the matter of life or death as far as I was concerned. I found my husband\r\n      out and I confronted him, saying: &#8220;You are not the only one who can have\r\n      a relationship. I have received a similar proposition.&#8221; And I told him\r\n      all about his friend. He was stunned and absolutely shocked. (I said:)\r\n      &#8220;If you want me to respond in kind to your relationship with that woman,\r\n      then this is for that, tit-for-tat.&#8221; This was a huge slap in the face\r\n      for him. He knew that I did not intend to do that in reality, but he\r\n      realized the great disaster that had befallen our lives and the immoral\r\n      atmosphere in which we were living. I suffered a great deal until my\r\n      husband finally left that loose woman with whom he was having a\r\n      relationship, as he admitted to me. Yes, he left her and came back to his\r\n      family and children, but how can I ever feel the same towards him as I\r\n      used to? Who will restore respect for him in my heart? This huge wound in\r\n      my heart is still bleeding out of regret and rage at that filthy\r\n      atmosphere; it still bears testimony to the fact that what they call\r\n      innocent get-togethers are in reality anything but innocent. My heart\r\n      still begs for mercy from the Lord of Glory.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>Intelligence can also be a temptation (fitnah)<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;&#8216;Abd al-Fattaah says:&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I work as the head of department in one of the big\r\n      companies. For a long time I admired one of my female colleagues, not for\r\n      her beauty, but for her serious attitude towards her work, her\r\n      intelligence and her excellent achievements &#8211; in addition to the fact\r\n      that she was a decent and modest person who focused only on her work. This\r\n      admiration turned into attachment, and I am a married man who fears Allaah\r\n      and never misses any obligatory prayer. I expressed my feelings to her and\r\n      she rebuffed me. She is married and has children as well. She sees no\r\n      reason why I should have any kind of relationship with her, whether it be\r\n      friendship, as work colleagues or based on admiration&#8230; etc. Evil\r\n      thoughts come to me sometimes, and deep down I wish that her husband would\r\n      divorce her so that I could get her.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;I started to put pressure on her at work and\r\n      put her down in front of my bosses. Perhaps this was a form of revenge on\r\n      my part, but she accepted it with good manners and did not complain or\r\n      comment. She works and works; her performance speaks of her quality, and\r\n      she knows this well. The more she resisted me, the stronger my infatuation\r\n      grew.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I am not a person who is easily tempted by women,\r\n      because I fear Allaah and I do not overstep the mark with them and go\r\n      beyond what is required by my work. But this woman attracted me. What is\r\n      the solution?&#8230; I do not know.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;Baby ducks know how to swim<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;N.A.A., a nineteen-year-old girl, tells us:&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>At that time I was a little girl. My innocent eyes\r\n      watched those evening get-togethers when family friends would meet in the\r\n      house. What I remember is that I could only see one man, who was my\r\n      father. I watched him as he moved about the room, how his glances would\r\n      devour the women present, looking at their thighs and chests, admiring\r\n      this one&#8217;s eyes, that one&#8217;s hair, the other&#8217;s hips. My poor mother\r\n      had no choice but to take care of these get-togethers. She was a very\r\n      simple lady.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>Among the women present there was one woman who would\r\n      deliberately try to attract my father&#8217;s attention, sometimes by coming\r\n      close to him, and sometimes by making enticing movements. I would watch\r\n      this with concern, whilst my mother was busy in the kitchen for the sake\r\n      of her guests.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;These gatherings stopped suddenly and I tried,\r\n      young as I was, to understand and make sense of what had happened, but I\r\n      could not.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>What I remember was that my mother collapsed\r\n      completely at that time, and she could not stand to hear my father&#8217;s\r\n      name mentioned in the house. I used to hear mysterious words whispered by\r\n      the adults around me: &#8220;Betrayal&#8230; bedroom&#8230; she saw them with her own\r\n      eyes&#8230; despicable woman&#8230; in a very shameful position&#8230;&#8221; etc. These\r\n      were the key words which only the adults could understand.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;I grew up and came to understand, and I bore a\r\n      grudge against all men. All of them were treacherous. My mother was a\r\n      broken woman and accused every woman who came to us of being a\r\n      man-snatcher who wanted to make my father fall into her trap. My father\r\n      hasn&#8217;t changed. He is still practising his favourite hobby of chasing\r\n      women, but now he does it outside the home. Now I am nineteen years old\r\n      and I know lots of young men. I feel great pleasure in taking revenge on\r\n      them, because every one of them is an exact copy of my father. I tempt\r\n      them and entice them, without letting them get anywhere near me. They\r\n      follow me in gatherings and in the marketplaces because of my movements\r\n      and deliberate gestures. Sometimes my phone never stops ringing and I feel\r\n      proud of what I do to avenge the sex of Hawwa&#8217; and my mother. But\r\n      sometimes I feel so miserable and such a failure that it almost chokes me.\r\n      My life is shadowed by a huge dark cloud, and its name is my father.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>Before it is too late<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>&nbsp;S.N.A. tells of her experience:&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>I never imagined that my work circumstances would\r\n      force me to be in contact with the opposite sex (men), but this in fact is\r\n      what happened&#8230;&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>In the beginning,<span>&nbsp;\r\n      <\/span>I used to cover and screen myself from men by wearing niqaab\r\n      (face-veil), but some of the sisters advised me that this dress was\r\n      attracting more attention to my presence, and it would be better for me to\r\n      take off the niqaab, especially since my eyes were somewhat attractive. So\r\n      I removed the cover from my face, thinking that this was better. But by\r\n      continuing to mix with my colleagues, I discovered that I was the odd one\r\n      out because of my antisocial attitude and my insistence on not joining in\r\n      the conversation and chatting with others. Everyone was wary of this\r\n      &#8220;lone-wolf&#8221; woman (as they saw me), and this is what was stated\r\n      clearly by one person who affirmed that he would not want to deal with\r\n      such a snooty and stand-offish character. But I knew that I was the\r\n      opposite, in fact, and I decided that I would not oppress myself and put\r\n      myself in a difficult position with my colleagues. So I started to join in\r\n      their chats and exchanges of anecdotes, and they all discovered that I\r\n      could speak eloquently and persuasively, and that I could influence\r\n      others. I could also speak in a manner that was determined yet at the same\r\n      time was attractive to some of my colleagues. It was not long before I\r\n      noticed some changes in the expression of my direct supervisor; with some\r\n      embarrassment, he was enjoying the way I spoke and moved, and he would\r\n      deliberately bring up topics in the conversation where I would see that\r\n      hateful look in his eyes. I do not deny the fact that I started to\r\n      entertain some thoughts about this man. I found it astonishing that a man\r\n      could fall so easily into the trap of a woman who was religiously\r\n      committed, so how must it be in the case of women who adorn themselves and\r\n      invite men to commit immoral actions? In fact, I did not think of him in\r\n      any way which went beyond the bounds of sharee&#8217;ah, but he did occupy a\r\n      space in my thoughts for quite some time. But soon my self-respect made me\r\n      reject the idea of being a source of enjoyment for this man in any way,\r\n      shape or form, even if it was only psychological in nature, and I stopped\r\n      getting involved in any kind of work that would force me to sit alone with\r\n      him. In the end, I reached the following conclusions:<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>1-<span>&nbsp;\r\n      <\/span>Attraction between the sexes can occur in any circumstances, no\r\n      matter how much men and women may deny that.

On the contrary, it corrupts sound thinking.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>What now?<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>We may ask, what comes next, after this discussion on\r\n      the matter of mixing?<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>It&#8217;s about time for us to recognize that no matter\r\n      how we try to beautify the issue of mixing and take the matter lightly,\r\n      its consequences are bound to catch up with us, and the harm it causes\r\n      will have disastrous results for our families. Sound common sense refuses\r\n      to accept that mixing is a healthy atmosphere for human relations. This is\r\n      the sound common sense which made most of the people included in this\r\n      survey (76%) prefer working in a non-mixed environment. The same\r\n      percentage (76%) said that mixing is not permitted according to the\r\n      sharee&#8217;ah. What makes us sit up and take notice is not this honourable\r\n      percentage &#8211; which indicates the purity of our Islamic society and the\r\n      cleanness of its members&#8217; hearts &#8211; but the small number who said that\r\n      mixing is permitted; they number 12%. This group, with no exceptions, said\r\n      that mixing is permitted but within the limits set by religion, custom\r\n      (&#8216;<i>urf<\/i>), traditions, good manners, conscience, modesty, covering\r\n      and other worthy values which, in their opinion, keep mixing within proper\r\n      limits.<\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>We ask them: is the mixing which we see nowadays in\r\n      our universities, market-places, work-places and family and social\r\n      gatherings, taking place within the limits referred to above? Or are these\r\n      places filled with transgressions in terms of clothing, speech,\r\n      interactions and behaviour? We see wanton displays of adornment\r\n      (tabarruj), not proper covering; we see fitnah (temptations) and dubious\r\n      relationships, with no good manners and no conscience and no covering. We\r\n      can conclude that the kind of mixing that is happening nowadays is\r\n      unacceptable even to those who approve of mixing in a clean atmosphere.&nbsp;<o>\r\n      <\/o:p>\r\n      <\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>It&#8217;s about time for us to recognize that mixing\r\n      provides a fertile breeding-ground for social poisons to invade and take\r\n      over our society without anyone ever realizing that it is mixing which is\r\n      the cause.

Shaytaan is keen to tempt\r\n    people and make them fall into haraam deeds. The fuqaha&rsquo; are agreed that khulwah or\r\n    being alone with a woman to whom one is not related is forbidden. They said: &ldquo;No man\r\n    should be alone with a woman who is not his mahram (a close relative to whom marriage is\r\n    forbidden) or his wife, but is a stranger to him, because the Shaytaan will whisper to\r\n    them and tempt them to do something that is not permitted. (<i>Al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah\r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, 19\/267) It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a\r\n    non-mahram woman even if he is teaching her Qur&rsquo;aan, or to lead her in prayer if only\r\n    the two of them are present. The guideline regarding khulwah is that this prohibition\r\n    applies in any situation where their figures are hidden from other people (<i>Fath\r\n    al-Baari<\/i>, 9\/333). A taxi driver is bound to pass through empty streets\r\n    or highways, and the structure of the car conceals most of the body of a person riding in\r\n    it.

How many tragedies and\r\n    painful stories and disasters have occurred because of a driver being alone with a female\r\n    passenger! The wise sharee&rsquo;ah of Islam has taken all precautions to avoid anything\r\n    that may lead to wrongdoing. It is essential to completely avoid any situation where a man\r\n    and woman who are not related may be alone together. A taxi driver should not accept a\r\n    female passenger who is alone, except in cases of emergency such as accidents and the\r\n    like.

The evidence for this is that a beardless youth is, in some ways, \r\n    like a woman; he may be desired as a woman is desired, and his form may be \r\n    beautiful like that of a woman, and many of them may be more beautiful than \r\n    many women. The prohibition applies more to them for another reason, which \r\n    is that in their case there may result from attachment to them types of evil \r\n    that do not occur in the case of women.

In other words, which scholarly opinion should \r\n    the Muslim follow in matters where they differed? The answer depends:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; If the Muslim is one who has studied shar&rsquo;i knowledge and \r\n    learned its basic principles and minor issues, and he can distinguish right \r\n    from wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he has to follow that which \r\n    he thinks is correct and ignore that which he thinks is wrong.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; If he is one of the rank and file, or has not studied \r\n    shar&rsquo;i knowledge, and thus cannot distinguish between right and wrong with \r\n    regard to scholarly views, then he must follow the fatwa of a scholar whose \r\n    knowledge he trusts and who he believes to be trustworthy and religiously \r\n    committed, whether he is from his own country or another country, and \r\n    differences between scholars will not matter after that. He does not have to \r\n    change what he is doing because he hears another scholar issuing a fatwa \r\n    that differs from the one he is following, unless he realizes that what he \r\n    learned later on is the correct view, on the basis of his confidence in the \r\n    religious commitment and knowledge of the second Shaykh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who has knowledge of evidence is required to follow \r\n    the evidence, even if it goes against some of the imams, if it does not go \r\n    against the consensus of the ummah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who does not have any knowledge should ask the \r\n    scholars, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>\r\n    &ldquo;So ask&nbsp; of those who know the Scripture, if you know not&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Nahl 16:43]<\/i>. He should ask one who he thinks \r\n    has more knowledge and is more religiously committed, but that does not mean \r\n    that doing so obligatory, because the one who is better may make a mistake \r\n    with regard to a particular issue, and the one who is regarded as less \r\n    knowledgeable may be right with regard to it.

There is a great deal of evidence \r\n    and scholarly views concerning that, as among the Maalikis. Many of them \r\n    said that it is not permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of \r\n    non-mahram men, not because it is &lsquo;awrah but because uncovering it runs the \r\n    risk of fitnah. But some of them think that it is &lsquo;awrah. Hence women, in \r\n    their view, are forbidden to go out in front of non-mahram men with their \r\n    faces uncovered.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask \r\n    them from behind a screen&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Ahzaab 33:53]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    al-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi al-Maaliki (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The entire woman is &lsquo;awrah, her body and her voice, so it is \r\n    not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity, such as when \r\n    testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about \r\n    her health issues.

And what \r\n    is your opinion on the idea that women driving cars is less dangerous than \r\n    their riding with non-mahram drivers?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The answer to this question is based on two principles which \r\n    are well known among the Muslim scholars:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The first principle is: that whatever leads to haraam is \r\n    itself haraam. The evidence for this is the verse in which Allaah says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship \r\n    besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-An&rsquo;aam 6:108]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So Allaah forbids insulting the gods of the mushrikeen &ndash; even \r\n    though that serves an interest &ndash; because it leads to insults against \r\n    Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second principle is: \r\n    that warding off evil &ndash; if it is equal to or greater than the interests \r\n    concerned &ndash; takes precedence over bringing benefits. The evidence for that \r\n    is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;They ask you (O \r\n    Muhammad) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: In them is a great \r\n    sin, and (some) benefits for men, but the sin of them is greater than their \r\n    benefit&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:219]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has forbidden alcohol and gambling even though there \r\n    is some benefit in them, so as to ward off the evils that result from them. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on these two principles, the ruling on women driving \r\n    should be clear, because women driving includes a number of evils, including \r\n    the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Removal of hijab, because driving a car involves \r\n    uncovering the face which is the site of fitnah and attracts the glance of \r\n    men. A woman is only regarded as beautiful or ugly on the basis of her face, \r\n    i.e., if it is said that she is beautiful or ugly, people only think in \r\n    terms of her face. If something else is meant it must be specified, so that \r\n    one would say that she has beautiful hands or beautiful hair or beautiful \r\n    feet. Hence it is known that the face is the focal point. If someone were to \r\n    say that a woman can drive a car without taking off her hijab, by covering \r\n    her face and wearing dark glasses over her eyes, the answer to that is that \r\n    this is not what really happens when women drive cars. Ask those who have \r\n    seen them in other countries. Even if we assume that this could be applied \r\n    initially, it would not last for long, rather the situation would soon \r\n    become as it is in other countries where women drive. This is how things \r\n    usually develop; they start out in an acceptable fashion then they get \r\n    worse. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Another evil consequence of women driving cars is that \r\n    they lose their modesty, and modesty is part of faith as is narrated in a \r\n    saheeh report from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him). Modesty is the noble characteristic that befits the nature of women \r\n    and protects them from being exposed to fitnah. Hence it is mentioned in a \r\n    metaphorical sense (in Arabic), in the phrase &ldquo;more modest than a virgin in \r\n    her seclusion.&rdquo; Once a woman&rsquo;s modesty is lost, do not ask about her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; It also leads to women going out of the house a great \r\n    deal, but their homes are better for them &ndash; as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said &ndash; because those who love to drive \r\n    enjoy it very much, hence you see them driving around in their cars here and \r\n    there for no purpose, except to enjoy driving. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; You may find a divorced woman going where she wants, \r\n    whenever she wants and however she wants, for whatever purpose she wants, \r\n    because she is alone in her car, at any time she wants of the day or night. \r\n    She may stay out until late at night. If people are complaining about this \r\n    with regard to young men, then what about young women, going all over the \r\n    place the length and breadth of the country, and maybe even beyond its \r\n    borders.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; It is a means of women rebelling against their families \r\n    and husbands; at the least provocation they may go out of the house and \r\n    drive in the car to wherever they think they can get some peace, as happens \r\n    in the case of some young men, who are able to put up with more than women. \r\n    &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    6 &ndash; It is a cause of fitnah in many places: when stopping at \r\n    the traffic lights, or at gas stations, or at inspection points, or when \r\n    stopped by policemen at the scenes of traffic infractions or accidents, or \r\n    if the car stalls and the woman needs help. What will her situation be in \r\n    this case? Perhaps she may come across an immoral man who takes advantage of \r\n    her in return for helping her, especially if her need is great to the point \r\n    of urgency.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    7 &ndash; When women drive it leads to overcrowding in the streets, \r\n    or it deprives some young men of the opportunity to drive cars when they are \r\n    more deserving of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    8 &ndash; It causes fitnah to flourish because women &ndash; by their \r\n    nature &ndash; like to make themselves look good with clothing etc. Do you not see \r\n    how attached they are to fashion? Every time a new fashion appears they \r\n    throw away what they have and rush to buy the new things, even if it is \r\n    worse than what they have. Do you not see the adornments that they hang on \r\n    their walls? In the same way &ndash; or perhaps more so &ndash; with the cars that they \r\n    drive, whenever a new model appears they will give up the first for the new \r\n    one.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the questioner asking, &ldquo;And what is your \r\n    opinion on the idea that women driving cars is less dangerous than their \r\n    riding with non-mahram drivers?&rdquo; &ndash; what I think is that both of them involve \r\n    danger, and one is more serious than the other in some ways, but there is no \r\n    necessity that would require one to do either of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Please note that I have answered this question at length \r\n    because of the controversy that surrounds the issue of women driving cars, \r\n    and the pressure faced by conservative Saudi society, which is striving to \r\n    adhere to its religious commitment and morals, to allow women to drive \r\n    cars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This would be nothing strange if it were to come from an \r\n    enemy who seeks to cause harm this land which is the last bastion of Islam \r\n    that the enemies of Islam wish to penetrate. But what is even stranger is \r\n    that this is coming from our own people who speak our language and live \r\n    under our banner, people who are dazzled by what the kaafir nations have of \r\n    material advancement and admire their ways which are devoid of any moral \r\n    restrictions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to countries in which woman are allowed to drive \r\n    cars, Muslim women should avoid that as much as possible, for the reasons \r\n    mentioned above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In cases of necessity, such as helping accident victims or \r\n    fleeing from a criminal, there is nothing wrong with a Muslim woman using a \r\n    car in such situations, if she cannot find a man to help her.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There are other cases, such as women who have to go out to \r\n    work and have no husband, father or guardian to look after them and no \r\n    income from the government to meet their needs, and they cannot find work \r\n    that they can do at home, such as some internet-based jobs, so they are \r\n    forced to go out. In that case they can use the means of transportation that \r\n    poses the least danger to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There may be some means of transportation that are available \r\n    only to women, or a group of women may hire a driver to take them to work or \r\n    university. Using taxis&ndash; for those who can afford it &ndash; may be better than \r\n    using public transportation where a woman may be exposed to humiliation and \r\n    aggression, so they should use taxis, so long as they are not alone with the \r\n    driver.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a woman is forced to drive a car in cases of extreme need, \r\n    then she should drive wearing full jilbaab and hijab, and with fear of \r\n    Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We have already mentioned above what constitutes need.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Women should also seek fatwas from the trustworthy scholars \r\n    in their own countries &ndash; not those who are too lenient &ndash; who understand both \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah and the situation in that country.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you \r\n    can&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Taghaabun 64:16]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.

It is blatant riba (usury, interest) because it is a loan that brings a benefit. If a person pays in 100,000 riyals, to take \r\n    it back after a period of ten years, or seven, or whatever, with an added payment of 100,000 riyals, or 70,000, or even one riyal, then he has \r\n    engaged in blatant riba, which is haraam according to scholarly consensus.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;Imam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said: &ldquo;Every loan which is given subject to the condition than an increased amount be paid back is haraam, with no difference of opinion \r\n    (among the scholars). Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is consensus that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay extra or give him a gift, \r\n    and the money is lent on that basis, then his taking the extra amount is riba. It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka&rsquo;b, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood \r\n    forbade loans that bring benefit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, \r\n    6\/436.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It does not matter that the company calls \r\n    this transaction a savings plan or investment scheme or mudaarabah (silent partnership), because every investment that guarantees one&rsquo;s capital is \r\n    a loan, even if people call it something else. What counts is what a thing actually is, not what it is called.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the kinds of investments or \r\n    savings that are acceptable in Islam, they are based on certain conditions, the most important of which are as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The money should come from you, and the \r\n    labour or work should come from the other party; there is nothing wrong with the other party putting in money as well as work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; The area of investment should be clearly \r\n    defined, since most of these companies invest the money by putting it in riba-based banks, or in projects that are not permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Both parties should agree on the \r\n    percentage of profits allocated to each, which should not come from the capital, so you get 50% or 10% of the profits, for example.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;4 &ndash; The person who is doing business on your \r\n    behalf should not guarantee your capital. In the event of loss &ndash; so long as it is not caused by negligence &ndash; you will lose your capital and he \r\n    will lose his labour.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the capital is guaranteed, then this \r\n    transaction is a loan which must be paid off with no extra amount added. If an extra amount is stipulated, then this is riba. <br>\r\n    We ask Allaah to keep us safe from riba and its evil and dangers, and to make us independent by means of that which He has permitted so that we \r\n    will feel no need of that which He has forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The point is that the Aramco savings scheme \r\n    is haraam, because it guarantees the capital and because the profit is a set percentage of the capital. So it is a loan with interest, as well as \r\n    the fact that the investor does not know where his money will be invested.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Standing Committee pointed out that the \r\n    claim that what is given to the employee is a reward or bonus from the company is false, because it is only given to those who save with this \r\n    plan. If it was really a reward or bonus it would be given to all employees.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As the questioner mentioned, the Standing \r\n    Committee for Issuing Fatwas &ndash; under the leadership of Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), with whom were Shaykh &lsquo;Abd \r\n    al-Razzaaq &lsquo;Afeefi, Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan and Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Qa&rsquo;ood, who are all leading scholars &ndash; was asked about the savings \r\n    plan in the Aramco company. They replied as follows: &ldquo;Participating in the Aramco savings plan is haraam, because it involves two types of riba (<i>riba \r\n    al-fadl<\/i> and <i>riba al-nasa&rsquo;<\/i>); it defines the rate of interest, which may be anything between five and one hundred percent of the money \r\n    that is saved by the Saudi employee, in addition to the rewards that are given to the employee, to the exclusion of other employees who do not \r\n    invest, as is stated in the savings plan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, \r\n    13\/510-515&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen and other scholars also issued fatwas \r\n    stating that the Aramco savings plan is haraam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the scholars differ with regard to a \r\n    shar&rsquo;i ruling, the person who is seeking the fatwa should try to find out which is correct by examining the evidence quoted by both parties and \r\n    following that which he thinks is more correct. This applies if the person seeking the fatwa is a seeker of knowledge (taalib &lsquo;ilm) who is able to \r\n    determine which is more correct.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If he is not able to determine which is more \r\n    correct, because he has no specialized knowledge of sharee&rsquo;ah, then he must follow the view of the one whom he thinks is more knowledgeable and \r\n    more trustworthy; he does not have the right to choose whichever opinion he wants.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the issue at hand, the major \r\n    scholars have clearly stated that it is haraam, and they are more knowledgeable and more trustworthy than those who gave a different opinion &ndash; \r\n    which is not intended to belittle the other party &ndash; so you have to avoid this savings plan, for the reasons stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) was asked what the Muslim&rsquo;s attitude towards scholarly differences should be, He replied: &ldquo;If the Muslim has enough knowledge \r\n    to enable him to compare the scholarly opinions and their evidence, and to decide which is more correct, then he must do that, because Allaah has \r\n    commanded us to refer disputed matters to the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&lsquo;(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if \r\n    you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:59]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So he should refer the disputed matter to the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, and whatever seems to him to be more correct based on the evidence, he should follow it, because what is necessary is to \r\n    follow the evidence and the opinions of the scholars may be used to help one understand the evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But if the Muslim does not have enough \r\n    knowledge to be able to decide which scholarly view is more correct, then he must ask the scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment he \r\n    trusts, and follow the fatwas that they issue to him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;So ask the people of the Reminder if you \r\n    do not know&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>[al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:43]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The scholars have stated that the madhhab of the ordinary Muslim is the madhhab of his mufti \r\n    (the scholar whom he asks for a fatwa).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If the scholars&rsquo; opinions vary, then he must \r\n    follow the one who is most trustworthy and most knowledgeable. This is like when a person falls sick and he looks for the most trustworthy and \r\n    knowledgeable doctor because he is more likely than others to get it right. It is more important to be on the safe side in matters of religion \r\n    than in worldly matters.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is not permissible for a Muslim to select \r\n    the scholarly opinion that is in accordance with his own whims and desires, if that goes against the evidence, or to seek rulings from those whom \r\n    he thinks will be lenient in issuing fatwas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Rather he must try to be on the safe side with regard to his religion, and ask scholars who \r\n    are more knowledgeable and who fear Allaah more.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>From <i>Ikhtilaaf al-&lsquo;Ulama&rsquo; Asbaabuhu wa \r\n    Mawqifuna minhu<\/i>, p. 23.

These \r\n    resources are more deserving of being followed and their teachings adhered \r\n    to, because the laws that people agree to refer to and use to judge between \r\n    themselves; the curriculum that is decided for seekers of knowledge in \r\n    halaqahs and schools and at different academic stages that those who \r\n    specialize in sharee&rsquo;ah and fiqhi knowledge go through; the legacy which \r\n    should be well established in people&rsquo;s minds, and form their fiqhi culture; \r\n    the source that everyone who does not have the opportunities that the \r\n    mujtahideen have to study many issues and reach a conclusion concerning it; \r\n    and the discipline that puts an end to conflicts and disputes in society and \r\n    blocks the door to whims and desires and weird opinions &ndash; all of that is \r\n    represented in the four madhhabs, which is the greatest reason why they \r\n    should be followed.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Haafiz ibn Rajab says in his essay entitled <i>al-Radd \r\n    &lsquo;ala man attaba&rsquo;a ghayra al-Madhaahib al-Arba&rsquo;ah<\/i> (2\/624) (which was \r\n    published in a collection of his essays):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The wisdom of Allaah dictated that this religion and its \r\n    guidelines should be protected by means of appointing leaders of the people \r\n    concerning whom the ummah is unanimously on their knowledge and \r\n    understanding, and that they reached the highest level of knowledge of \r\n    rulings and fatwas among ahl al-ra&rsquo;y wa&rsquo;l-hadeeth. So the people became \r\n    dependent on them for fatwas, and referred to them to understand rulings.

Rather what we are speaking about is restraining \r\n    those who have not reached this pinnacle, who understand only a little, as \r\n    is the case with people nowadays, and as has been the case for a long time; \r\n    even though many claim to have reached this pinnacle, most of them have not \r\n    progressed beyond a beginner level.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who studies the history of fiqh and legislation will \r\n    realize that throughout all stages it was built on the efforts of some \r\n    scholars who became known among people for their knowledge, and news of \r\n    their virtue and piety spread far and wide, then people began taking \r\n    religious rulings from them, in most cases referring to their statements and \r\n    fatwas. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim said in <i>I&rsquo;laam al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een<\/i> (1\/17):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Religion, fiqh and knowledge became widespread in the ummah, \r\n    narrated from the companions of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, the companions of Zayd ibn \r\n    Thaabit, the companions of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar and the companions of \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas. Most of the knowledge that the people have comes \r\n    from the companions of these four. For the people of Madeenah, their \r\n    knowledge came from the companions of Zayd ibn Thaabit and &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Umar. For the people of Makkah, their knowledge came from the companions of \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas. For the people of Iraq, their knowledge came from \r\n    the companions of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholar and commentator Ahmad Pasha Taymoor (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Madhaahib al-Fiqhiyyah al-Arba&rsquo;ah<\/i> \r\n    (16-17): Before the emergence of these madhhabs, at the time of the Sahaabah \r\n    and Taabi&rsquo;een, fatwas were taken from the qurra&rsquo;s among them, who were the \r\n    bearers of the Book of Allaah and understood its meanings. When their era \r\n    finished and the generation of the Taabi&rsquo;een came after them, the people of \r\n    each country followed the fatwas of the Sahaabah who had been among them, \r\n    and they did not go beyond that except in a few matters that reached them \r\n    from others. So the people of Madeenah for the most part followed the fatwas \r\n    of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar; the people of Kufah followed the fatwas of \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood; the people of Makkah followed the fatwas of \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas; and the people of Egypt followed the fatwas of \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Amr ibn al-&lsquo;Aas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    After the Taabi&rsquo;een came the fuqaha&rsquo; of the various regions, \r\n    such as Abu Haneefah, Maalik and others whom we have mentioned and whom we \r\n    have not mentioned. So the people of each region followed the madhhab of the \r\n    faqeeh for the most part. There are reasons why some of these madhhabs \r\n    spread in other lands and some became extinct&hellip; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That does not mean that one should blindly adhere to one \r\n    madhhab or opinion, in the sense of obliging people to follow it to the \r\n    letter without any ijtihaad or effort to correct it. Rather the point is \r\n    that the school of fiqhi thought that people, seekers of knowledge and \r\n    scholars should study should be taken from one of the four madhhabs. Then, \r\n    if it becomes clear to one who is qualified to engage in ijtihaad that the \r\n    madhhab is mistaken on a specific issue, he should reject that fatwa and \r\n    follow the view that he thinks is correct from the other madhhabs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus people may adhere to the academic way which was followed \r\n    by the salaf and imams, and they may rid themselves of some of the negatives \r\n    that resulted from ignorance and blind following.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraheem<\/i> \r\n    (2\/10, tape 2):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Following one of the four madhhabs is correct, rather it is \r\n    like consensus, and there are no reservations about that, such as saying \r\n    that one follows one of the four, because they are qualified imams according \r\n    to consensus.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    People have two extremes and a moderate way with regard to \r\n    that:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people do not think that we should follow any madhhab at \r\n    all. This is wrong.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some follow their madhhab to the letter without paying any \r\n    attention to study or research.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some people think that following a madhhab is correct and \r\n    there are no reservations about it, so wherever they find stronger evidence \r\n    with one of the four or with someone else, they follow it. In cases where \r\n    the issue is supported by a text or is clear, no attention should be paid to \r\n    the madhhabs, but if there is an issue concerning which there is no text or \r\n    it is not clear, but there are some views concerning it in these madhhabs, \r\n    and you see stronger evidence with a scholar who differs from these four \r\n    madhhabs, then you may follow that.

Some of them even went so far as to adopt this fiqh and regard it as \r\n    being obligatory for the scholars of sharee&lsquo;ah and the fuqaha&rsquo;. Some of them \r\n    accused many of the shaykhs and scholars of not understanding reality and \r\n    not having enough knowledge of it; on the other hand, there is a group who \r\n    disallow paying attention to events happening around the world.

I do not disagree in principle with this concept for which they \r\n    came up with this name of fiqh al-waaqi&lsquo;, because many of the scholars \r\n    stated clearly that those who lead the ummah and give answers to solve its \r\n    problems should have knowledge and understanding of circumstances and \r\n    realities. Hence one of their famous sayings is: The ruling on a thing is a \r\n    projection of one&rsquo;s understanding of it, and that cannot be achieved except \r\n    by understanding the circumstances surrounding the issue for which they have \r\n    to give an answer. This is one of the bases of giving rulings and fatwas in \r\n    particular, and is one of the principles of knowledge in general. So fiqh \r\n    al-waaqi&lsquo; means understanding what concerns the Muslims with regard to their \r\n    own affairs or the plots of their enemies, so as to warn them or help them \r\n    to progress in a real sense and not just in theory when focusing on news of \r\n    the kuffaar or focusing totally on their analysis and ideas. Understanding \r\n    reality in order to reach the shar&lsquo;i ruling is an important duty that a \r\n    specialised and smart group of seekers of knowledge have to do. This is just \r\n    like any other branch of knowledge, whether it has to do with sharee&lsquo;ah, \r\n    social sciences, economics, military matters or any other branch of \r\n    knowledge that is of benefit the Muslim ummah and will bring it back to its \r\n    position of glory and leadership, especially when these branches of \r\n    knowledge are developing from one time and place to another.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>But we have \r\n    heard and seen that many young Muslims are confused with regard to this type \r\n    of knowledge that we referred to above by the name of fiqh al-waaqi&lsquo;. They \r\n    have, unfortunately, divided into two groups; some went to extremes with \r\n    regard to this matter and others fell short. Now you can see and hear -- \r\n    from those who exaggerate about the importance of fiqh al-waaqi&lsquo; and raise \r\n    it above its rightful level -- that they want every scholar of sharee&lsquo;ah to \r\n    be knowledgeable about what they call fiqh al-waaqi&lsquo;, and the opposite is \r\n    also applicable to them. They give the impression to those who listen to and \r\n    support them that anyone who has knowledge of what is happening in the \r\n    Muslim world has good understanding of the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and is \r\n    following the path of the righteous Salaf! But that is not necessarily the \r\n    case, as is quite obvious. We cannot imagine the existence of a man who is \r\n    perfect in all senses, i.e., one who could have knowledge of all the \r\n    branches of knowledge referred to and discussed above.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>So what is \r\n    required is for those who have devoted themselves to knowing the reality of \r\n    the Muslim ummah and the plots that are made against it is for them to \r\n    cooperate with the scholars of Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, according to the way of \r\n    the early generations of this ummah, so that the former may present their \r\n    understanding and ideas and the latter may issue the Islamic ruling on them, \r\n    based on sound evidence and proof. As for the one who speaks of fiqh \r\n    al-waaqi&lsquo; being regarded in the minds of his listeners as a scholar or mufti \r\n    for no other reason than that he is speaking to them on the basis of this \r\n    &ldquo;fiqh&rdquo;, this cannot be correct in any way, because his words may be used as \r\n    a reason to reject the fatwas of the scholars and their views and rulings.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Su&rsquo;aal wa \r\n    Jawaab hawla Fiqh al-Waaqi&lsquo;<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    p. 14-16&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>And he (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>So it is as \r\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Thus We have made you [true \r\n    Muslims &mdash; real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet \r\n    Muhammad <span>&#1589;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1608;&#1587;&#1604;&#1605;<\/span> and his \r\n    Sunnah (legal ways)], a just (and the best) nation&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:143].<\/i>\r\n    <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Fiqh al-waaqi&lsquo; \r\n    in the correct shar&lsquo;i sense is undoubtedly something obligatory, but that is \r\n    a communal obligation (fard kifaayah): if some of the scholars undertake it, \r\n    the obligation is waived for the other scholars, let alone seekers of \r\n    knowledge and let alone the ordinary Muslims.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Hence \r\n    moderation is essential when calling upon Muslims to be aware of fiqh \r\n    al-waaqi&lsquo;, and we should not overwhelm them with political news and analysis \r\n    of western thinkers. Rather what is needed -- always -- is to focus on \r\n    purifying Islam from any contamination, then to educate the Muslims -- \r\n    collectively and individually -- in this pure Islam and to bring them back \r\n    to the original message: the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah according to the \r\n    understanding of the early generations of the ummah.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Su&rsquo;aal wa \r\n    Jawaab hawla Fiqh al-Waaqi&lsquo;<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    p. 25&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Shaykh Saalih \r\n    al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>As for \r\n    focusing on contemporary reality -- or fiqh al-waaqi&lsquo; -- this can only be \r\n    done after attaining understanding of sharee&lsquo;ah, because it is on the basis \r\n    of understanding sharee&lsquo;ah that one should look at people&rsquo;s real-life \r\n    situation and what is happening in the world of ideas and opinions, and \r\n    measure them against sound shar&lsquo;i knowledge, in order to distinguish between \r\n    which of these things are good and which are bad. Without shar&lsquo;i knowledge \r\n    one cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood, guidance and \r\n    misguidance.

One example is that of the famous story about pollinating date \r\n    palms. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the actions of the Prophet of Allah (may Allah&rsquo;s peace \r\n    and blessing be upon him), they fall into four categories. First, there are \r\n    those actions which were for the sake of legislation. Secondly, there are \r\n    those actions which were natural and habitual actions which conform with \r\n    being human. There were also those actions which wavered between being \r\n    habit\/ custom and being legislation.

Therefore, it is necessary (obligatory) to \r\n    follow him in his actions, just as it is to follow his sayings unless an \r\n    evidence establishes that it is recommended or specific to the Prophet.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Others said: It carries the possibility of being obligatory, \r\n    encouraged or permitted and so corroborating evidence is required.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The majority opine that it (actions) is encouraged if the \r\n    aspect of worship is apparent.

If \r\n    the aspect of worship is apparent, then it is encouraged, and if no aspect \r\n    of worship is apparent, then it is permitted. As for his tacit approval of \r\n    things which are done in his presence, then that indicates permissibility. \r\n    The issue is elaborated on in the principles of jurisprudence. End of quote \r\n    from Fath al Bari (13\/ 288-289).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From the examples of what is for legislation: The actions of \r\n    Wudhu (ablution), Salah (formal prayers), and Hajj (pilgrimage). It is known \r\n    that they are for legislation from different angles:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    First: They are clarification for something commanded, either \r\n    obligatory or encouraged, such as the actions of wudhu for they are \r\n    clarification of the (meanings of the) saying of the Exalted: <b>\r\n    &ldquo;O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, \r\n    wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and \r\n    wash your feet to the ankles.&rdquo; (5:6) <\/b><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Second: There is an open call to imitate and follow as in his \r\n    (may Allah&rsquo;s peace and blessing be upon him) saying: &ldquo;Pray as you have seen \r\n    me pray&rdquo;, or his saying &ldquo;Take your rites (of Hajj) from me.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Third: Incitement towards doing the action while doing it \r\n    himself, so in this case the sunnah of word and action are combined.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The gauge for customary practices is: Everything that is done \r\n    by human nature and there is no apparent intent of worship or legislation or \r\n    invitation to imitate in it such as; standing and sitting, eating and \r\n    drinking, sleeping, taking shade, walking, combing hair and the lengthening \r\n    or shortening of it, the wearing of a waist wrapper, (upper) body cover, \r\n    shirt (robe) or turban because people must wear garments and the Prophet \r\n    (may Allah&rsquo;s peace and blessings be upon him) wore these garments which \r\n    existed among his people.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for what may possibly be from customary practices or for \r\n    legislation, then its gauge is: It is done by human nature, but it occurred \r\n    along with an act of worship, either a part of it or a means towards it as \r\n    in riding for Hajj or entering Makkah from Kada or his (may Allah&rsquo;s peace \r\n    and blessing be upon him) stopping in al Muhassab after Hajj (which is the \r\n    name of a place between Makkah and Mina, although closer to Mina and it is \r\n    also known as al Abtah). The Companions differed over this stopping as to \r\n    whether it was for legislation or not. &lsquo;Abdullah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be \r\n    pleased with them both) saw that it was sunnah while &lsquo;Abdullah ibn &lsquo;Abbas \r\n    (may Allah be pleased with them both) used to say that &ldquo;at-Tahseeb&rdquo; \r\n    (stopping in al Muhassab) was nothing. It was merely a place where the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (may Allah&rsquo;s peace and blessings be upon him) stopped.&rdquo; \r\n    &lsquo;Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) agreed with ibn &lsquo;Abbas and said: \r\n    &ldquo;Stopping al Abtah is not sunnah. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah&rsquo;s peace \r\n    and blessings be upon him) only stopped there because it would have been \r\n    easier for him to leave when he left.&rdquo; See: Saheeh al Bukhari (1765, 1766) \r\n    and Saheeh Muslim (1310).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So whatever carries the possibility of being either from \r\n    customary practices or for legislation, will either be encouraged or \r\n    permitted.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for that which is purely customary practice, then it is \r\n    permitted\/ allowed, and if one were to follow it then there is no blame on \r\n    him for &lsquo;Abdullah ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to wear \r\n    (cow) leather sandals and dye his hair with sufrah (a yellowish colour). \r\n    When asked about it he said: &ldquo;As for the leather sandals, I saw the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wear \r\n    sandals which had no hair (fur) on them and took ablution with them on so I \r\n    like to wear them. As for the sufrah (yellowish dye), then I saw the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (may Allah&rsquo;s peace and blessing be upon him) dyeing with \r\n    it and I like to dye with it.

In that case, one should leave it due to what \r\n    is in it of seeking fame (deliberately trying to stand out and attract \r\n    attention), or imitating those whom we have been ordered to differ from.&nbsp;\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al Hafidh ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said while \r\n    speaking on dyeing (hair), that is: with henna. The difference among the \r\n    pious predecessors regarding it: <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Dyeing (hair) in general is most befitting as by way of it \r\n    one fulfils the obligation of differing from the People of the Book, and one \r\n    protects his hair from having dust and other things sticking to it, unless \r\n    it is customary for the people of the land to leave off dyeing and the one \r\n    amongst them who does it alone becomes known (stands out) due to it. In that \r\n    case, leaving it is better.&rdquo; End quote from Fath al Bari (10\/367-368)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A group of scholars have stated this with regards to the two \r\n    issues of wearing a turban and lengthening the hair as previously clarified \r\n    in question [fatout]113894[\\fatout] and \r\n    question [fatin]69822[\\fatin].<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4149","question_id":"4149","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Not doing something mustahabb does not mean that one falls \r\n    into doing something makrooh in principle, because what is mustahabb comes \r\n    under the heading of commands and what is makrooh comes under the heading of \r\n    prohibitions.

This is what our Lord and our Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have enjoined \r\n    upon us, and all the scholars are unanimously agreed on that, apart from the ignorant blind followers and the hard-hearted.

That applies only to matters of ijtihaad. \r\n          Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;Their view that \r\n          in matters of dispute no views may be denounced is not correct. The \r\n          denunciation is directed either at the opinion and fatwa, or at the \r\n          action. In the first case, if the opinion goes against Sunnah or a well-known \r\n          ijmaa&rsquo; (consensus), it must be denounced unanimously. This confusion \r\n          arises when the one who says it believes that controversial matters \r\n          are matters which are subject to ijtihaad, as is believed by groups \r\n          of people who do not have deep knowledge. The correct view is that of \r\n          the imaams, which is that there is room for ijtihaad in cases where \r\n          there is no clear evidence which we should follow, such as a saheeh \r\n          hadeeth which does not conflict with other evidence of the same calibre \r\n          . There are many ssues concerning which the earlier and later generations \r\n          differed, but in many cases we have reached a point of certainty as \r\n          to which of the two views is correct.&rdquo; (<i><span>I&rsquo;laam \r\n          al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een<\/span><\/i>, vol. 3\/288). <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>The reference point in \r\n          all cases must be the texts of the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.

If the saheeh Sunnah which has been reported \r\n          via a sound chain from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is rejected because there \r\n          is someone who says something different concerning this matter, this \r\n          implies that a person thinks that the words and commands of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) do not carry any weight unless people unanimously agree \r\n          with it, and the fact that someone disagrees with it, no matter who \r\n          he is, is taken as a reason to take away this authority [of the Sunnah] \r\n          and leave the matter wide open (to dispute).

The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to allow them a certain \r\n          amount of room in understanding the texts of sharee&rsquo;ah, then he would \r\n          approve of their interpretation or correct them. At the time of the \r\n          Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a number of the Sahaabah \r\n          used to issue fatwas (legal rulings). Some of the scholars said that \r\n          they numbered fourteen, but in fact there were more than that. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the imaam (leader) and \r\n          teacher of mankind and at that time people spoke proper Arabic so whatever \r\n          variations in interpretation there were, were few and minor. So the \r\n          death of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was counted as a great loss \r\n          to the ummah, because they lost their leader, guide and perfect example.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>It was \r\n          narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: &ldquo;After the death of the Messenger \r\n          of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Abu Bakr said to &lsquo;Umar, \r\n          &lsquo;Let us go to Umm Ayman and visit her as the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. When they came \r\n          to her, she wept, and they said to her, &lsquo;Why are you weeping? What is \r\n          with Allaah is better for His Messenger \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;I am not weeping \r\n          because I do not know that what is with Allaah is better for His Messenger \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); rather I am weeping because \r\n          the revelation from heaven has come to an end.&rsquo; She moved them to tears \r\n          and they started weeping with her.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 2454). But \r\n          the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not die until after \r\n          the religion had been completed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>One of \r\n          the characteristics of this religion, which was perfected during the \r\n          time of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), was that it includes features \r\n          which qualify it to remain and continue until the end of time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>Therefore \r\n          this religion and understanding of it remained after the death of the \r\n          Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it will abide until \r\n          the Day of Resurrection. After the death of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the people followed his \r\n          guidance and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs who followed \r\n          him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to judge amongst \r\n          them and issue fatwas to them based on what he found in the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n          and hadeeth. If he could not find an answer, he would go out and ask \r\n          the Muslims, saying, &ldquo;Such and such an issue has been referred to me, \r\n          do you know whether the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed a judgement concerning \r\n          such a matter?&rdquo; Then perhaps a group of them would come to him, all \r\n          of them saying that the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had passed a judgement on \r\n          it. Then Abu Bakr would say, &ldquo;Praise be to Allaah Who has caused there \r\n          to be among us those who memorized things from our Prophet.&rdquo; And if \r\n          he was unable to find any Sunnah narrated from the Messenger of Allaah \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he would gather the leaders \r\n          of the people and the best among them and if they agreed on something \r\n          he would pass judgement according to that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>&lsquo;Umar \r\n          (may Allaah be pleased with him) did the same after Abu Bakr had died.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>Then the \r\n          Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) dispersed to different regions \r\n          as teachers and mujaahideen, after the expansion of the Islamic territory. \r\n          Each of them used to issue fatwas in accordance with what he knew of \r\n          the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, or the actions of Abu Bakr or &lsquo;Umar, or the \r\n          conclusions to which his own ijtihaad led him. The muftis among the \r\n          Sahaabah numbered more than one hundred, and those who issued many fatwas \r\n          numbered seven, as Ibn al-Qayyim says. They were: &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab, \r\n          &lsquo;Ali ibn Abi Taalib, &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah Umm al-Mu&rsquo;mineen, \r\n          Zayd ibn Thaabit, &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas and &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar \r\n          (may Allaah be pleased with them all).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>&lsquo;Umar \r\n          (may Allaah be pleased with him) and his son, and Zayd ibn Thaabit (may \r\n          Allaah be pleased with them), were in Madeenah, and many students became \r\n          scholars at their hands,&nbsp; such as Saalim ibn &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Umar, \r\n          Naafi&rsquo; and others. Their knowledge was passed to the seven fuqaha&rsquo; and \r\n          ultimately to Imaam Maalik ibn Anas al-Asbahi.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood \r\n          and then &lsquo;Ali were in Kufa, and a number of the Taabi&rsquo;een learned from \r\n          them, such as &lsquo;Ilqimah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, Shurayh al-Qaadi, Silah ibn \r\n          Zafar and many others besides them, until that knowledge reached Imaam \r\n          Abu Haneefah al-Nu&rsquo;maan ibn Thaabit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>Fiqh and \r\n          knowledge spread throughout the ummah from the companions of Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood, \r\n          the companions of Zayd ibn Thaabit, the companions of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n          &lsquo;Umar, and the companions of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas. That happened \r\n          in Kufa, Madeenah and Makkah, respectively. These Taabi&rsquo;een used to \r\n          issue fatwas when the greatest Sahaabah were present, and they granted \r\n          them permission to do that. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>For example, \r\n          Ibn &lsquo;Umar used to say of Sa&rsquo;eed ibn al-Musayyib: he is one of the muftis \r\n          or one of those to be followed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>And he \r\n          said of him: if the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had seen him, he would have \r\n          been happy with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>Via these \r\n          people, knowledge spread far and wide. Then the ahaadeeth were compiled \r\n          in books and the numbers of students increased who occupied themselves \r\n          with memorizing them and writing them down; then knowledge spread throughout \r\n          the earth. Most of the people were religiously-committed and aware, \r\n          and this prevented anyone from speaking without knowledge or claiming \r\n          to be a scholar when he was not qualified to describe himself as such. \r\n          Then differences because widespread and people became involved in the \r\n          field of knowledge who would have been better off refraining from it. \r\n          But by the wisdom of Allaah the religion was regulated and preserved \r\n          by imams whom the ummah agreed that they were leaders and knowledgeable \r\n          and that they had reached the utmost degree of knowledge of rulings \r\n          and fatwas. Allaah caused them to become well known and their virtue \r\n          spread throughout the world. Students flocked to them to learn and study, \r\n          and their views were compiled in books. The opinions of the Sunni schools \r\n          of thought which followed the truth of the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah and which \r\n          rejected innovations in religion (bid&rsquo;ah), according to what was transmitted \r\n          by the students of the great imams, were recorded according to what \r\n          was transmitted by the students of these great scholars, so the views \r\n          of each imaam became a madhhab that is followed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>The most \r\n          famous of these madhhabs nowadays are just four: the Hanafi, Maaliki, \r\n          Shaafa&rsquo;i and Hanbali madhhabs. The followers of these madhhabs are agreed \r\n          on most matters and on the most important issues of religion, and the \r\n          differences in understanding and in the evidence that reached them have \r\n          to do with minor issues. All of them are following something good, may \r\n          Allaah have mercy on them. Then each of these madhhabs developed in \r\n          ways which it would take too long to explain here, until things became \r\n          as they are nowadays, where each madhhab has books containing its issues \r\n          and methods of deriving rulings and interpreting evidence. And among \r\n          the imams there are, praise be to Allaah, mujtahids who can produce \r\n          rulings on contemporary events and issues by means of the understanding \r\n          that Allaah has bestowed upon them, using ijtihaad, qiyaas (analogy), \r\n          the principles of the objectives of sharee&rsquo;ah, the sayings of previous \r\n          scholars, and the principles of usool al-fiqh. Thus fiqh continued to \r\n          be a rich discipline, comprehending all the issues of life which the \r\n          Muslims need to know about.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>At all \r\n          times there is someone who is showing the correct way, based on evidence, \r\n          who recognizes the truth concerning a certain issue and he knows how \r\n          to reach the correct conclusion. The scholars could not agree on something \r\n          that is incorrect, hence the ummah cannot all follow falsehood. We ask \r\n          Allaah to cause us to understand His religion and to bless us with knowledge \r\n          and righteous deeds. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p>For more \r\n          information see:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p><i>Al-Fikr \r\n          al-Saami fi Taareekh al-Fiqh al-Islaami<\/i> and \r\n          <i> Taareekh al-Fiqh al-Islami<\/i> by &lsquo;Umar ibn Sulaymaan al-Ashqar.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          And Allaah knows best. \r\n      <br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"4158","question_id":"4158","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Praise be to Allaah Who has guided you to Islam; we ask Him \r\n    to make you steadfast in it until you meet Him, for He is all Hearing, Ever \r\n    Responsive.

The Creator and the One \r\n    Who is rightfully worshipped is Allaah alone; everything other than Him is \r\n    created and worships Him either willingly and by choice &ndash; which is the case \r\n    with the believers &ndash; or by force, which is the case of the kaafirs and \r\n    sinners, whose submission to Allaah consists of their being subjugated to \r\n    His control, for they do not have to power to either benefit or harm \r\n    themselves. Allaah is the One Who has given them life, and when He wills He \r\n    will cause them to die. If Allaah wills, He can make them sick, and if He \r\n    wills He can heal them. He can make them rich whenever He wants and make \r\n    them poor whenever He wants. Glory and praise be to Him, there is no Lord \r\n    besides Him and none worthy of worship except Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to his believing slaves, they are tried and \r\n    tested in this brief, transient world. If they succeed in remaining \r\n    steadfast in worshipping their Lord and attaining the highest degree of \r\n    submission to Him, He will compensate them for that, by His kindness and \r\n    grace, with Paradise in which there is that which no eye has seen, no ear \r\n    has heard, and it has not entered the heart of man.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Among these tests is the fact that Allaah commands them to do \r\n    some things for which their minds cannot comprehend the wisdom behind them, \r\n    they can only submit and obey. This is in order to distinguish those who are \r\n    sincere in their claims to be believers from those who are insincere. For \r\n    Allaah is the Creator of reason, and He is the One Who issues the command, \r\n    so whoever responds and submits, and says, &ldquo;I hear and obey, even though I \r\n    do not understand the reason, because I admit my mortality, my weakness and \r\n    my submission to Allaah, for Allaah cannot be questioned as to what He does&rdquo; \r\n    &ndash; such a one is a believer who, it is hoped, will prosper and succeed in \r\n    this world and in the Hereafter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is how the Companions of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) were, as al-Bukhaari (1597) and Muslim \r\n    (1270) narrated in their <i>Saheehs<\/i> that &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said of the Black Stone when he kissed it: &ldquo;By \r\n    Allaah, I know that you are only a stone and you can neither bring benefit \r\n    nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen the Messenger of Allaah kissing \r\n    you I would not have kissed you.&rdquo; So when we Muslims pray facing the \r\n    direction of the Ka&rsquo;bah, we do so because Allaah has commanded us to do \r\n    that. If he had commanded us to pray facing in any other direction, we would \r\n    have had to do that. The same applies to many other acts of worship, We pray \r\n    Zuhr with four rak&rsquo;ahs and Maghrib with three and Fajr with two, because \r\n    Allaah has commanded us to do so. We perform Tawaaf seven times around the \r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah, and we stone the Jamaraat seven times, and we do not do more than \r\n    that under any circumstances. All of that is because that is what Allaah has \r\n    commanded us to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So whoever bears this thought in mind whilst doing these acts \r\n    of worship will undoubtedly increase in submission to Allaah; this will \r\n    increase his faith and bring him closer to his Lord. Thus he will find great \r\n    joy and immense happiness and deep contentment in his heart, which will make \r\n    him long for worship and love it, because when he does acts of worship he \r\n    will feel that he is doing them for Allaah, and were it not for Allaah, he \r\n    would not do them. So every act of worship brings him closer to Allaah and \r\n    increases him in faith until he meets Allaah and Allaah will honour him as \r\n    He honours His righteous slaves.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But for the one who is stubborn and arrogant, and says, &ldquo;I \r\n    will not do it until I understand&rdquo;, this is like Iblees who rebelled against \r\n    Allaah and said, as Allaah tells us in the Qur&rsquo;aan (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo;Shall I prostrate myself to one whom You created from clay?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    [al-Israa&rsquo; 17:61]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is sufficient to demonstrate the seriousness of arguing \r\n    against the sharee&rsquo;ah on the basis of reason. Rather Allaah has described \r\n    one of the most unique characteristics of the pious believers as being \r\n    belief in the Unseen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;This is the Book (the Qur&rsquo;aan), whereof there is no \r\n    doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious believers of \r\n    Islamic Monotheism who fear Allaah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and \r\n    evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allaah much (perform all kinds \r\n    of good deeds which He has ordained)].<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Who believe in the Ghayb (the unseen) and perform \r\n    As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and spend out of what we have provided for \r\n    them&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:2-3]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the first characteristic by which the believers are \r\n    distinguished from others is the fact that they believe in the unseen or \r\n    that which they cannot grasp, whether that is in a literal, physical sense \r\n    or in a metaphorical, intellectual sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What we should point out here is that our prayer facing the \r\n    direction of the Ka&rsquo;bah has nothing to do with the structure of the Ka&rsquo;bah, \r\n    rather it has to do with its location. If it were to be destroyed, we would \r\n    still pray in that direction, not to that structure.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence we find that nowadays Muslims pray on the second storey \r\n    and on the roof of the Grand Mosque in the Sanctuary of Makkah, facing the \r\n    direction of the Ka&rsquo;bah even though it is not directly in front of them. \r\n    This is what millions of Muslims do throughout the world, praying in the \r\n    direction of the Ka&rsquo;bah even though they cannot see it. This demonstrates \r\n    the great difference between the laws of Islam and the actions of the \r\n    mushrikeen (polytheists) whose worship of their idols, stones and trees \r\n    ceases when these objects cease to exist. Therefore if the mushrik cannot \r\n    see his object of worship or idol, he does not face the direction of that \r\n    thing.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We ask Allaah to bestow upon us sincere faith, and to make us \r\n    steadfast in it until we meet Him&hellip; Aameen.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"4159","question_id":"4159","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The story of the pollination of the date-palm trees describes how, when\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah, he saw the\r\n    people there pollinating the date-palm trees by hand, and he said to them, &ldquo;If you do\r\n    not do this, it should still be fine.&rdquo; So they did not do it, and the crop failed,\r\n    producing only bad dates.

This is \r\n    unlike the rulings that are derived from shar&rsquo;i evidence and are not based on custom and tradition, which do not change.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For example: the punishment for murder is execution.

This difference is not based on evidence, rather it stems from changes in customs and traditions regarding the way in \r\n    which houses are built. That is because in the past, when a house was built the custom was for all its rooms to be the same, so if a person saw \r\n    some of the rooms he had no need to see the rest.

Allaah says\r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): &ldquo;. . . And let those who oppose the Messenger&rsquo;s\r\n    commandment beware, lest some <i>fitnah<\/i> (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a\r\n    painful torment be inflicted on them.&rdquo; [<\/big>al-Nur 24:63<big>]<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>(c) Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty;\r\n    resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: &ldquo;&rdquo;But no, by your Lord, they\r\n    can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and\r\n    find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full\r\n    submission.&rdquo; <\/big>[al-Nisaa&rsquo; 4:65]<\/p>\r\n    <p><big>(d) Allaah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger:\r\n    &ldquo;O you who believe!

For\r\n    example:<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>(a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi&rsquo; and others that the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) said: &ldquo;I do not want to see any one of you reclining\r\n    on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying &lsquo;I\r\n    don&rsquo;t accept it; we didn&rsquo;t find any such thing in the Book of\r\n    Allaah.&rsquo;&rdquo; Abu &lsquo;Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth.

I tell you, by Allaah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited\r\n    things that are as important as what is in the Qur&rsquo;aan, if not more so.&rdquo;\r\n    (Reported by Abu Dawud, <i>Kitaab al-Khiraj wa&rsquo;l-imaarah wa&rsquo;l-fay&rsquo;<\/i>).<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>(b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-&rsquo;Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may\r\n    Allaah be pleased with him, that &ldquo;the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace be upon him)\r\n    led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said),\r\n    &lsquo;Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after\r\n    me, adhere to it and hold fast to it.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<i>Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah<\/i>).<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>(3) The scholars&rsquo; consensus (<i>ijmaa&rsquo;<\/i>) affirming the\r\n    importance of the Sunnah.<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>Al-Shaafi&rsquo;i, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &ldquo;I do not\r\n    know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabi&rsquo;een who narrated a report from the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and\r\n    affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabi&rsquo;een, and those whom we\r\n    met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those\r\n    who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this\r\n    path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be\r\n    considered as one of the ignorant.<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>(4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah.<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>The fact that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace be upon him) is the Messenger\r\n    of Allaah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he\r\n    gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition\r\n    to what is in the Qur&rsquo;aan. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and\r\n    the Qur&rsquo;aan when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to\r\n    believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions.<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is\r\n    that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of\r\n    the religion.<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>As regards your second question, about whether a Muslim is required\r\n    to follow a particular madhhab, the answer is that he does not have to. For the average\r\n    &ldquo;rank and file&rdquo; Muslim, his madhhab is that of his mufti or the scholar whom he\r\n    consults for religious verdicts; he must ask those pious scholars whom he trusts for\r\n    opinions when necessary. If a person has enough knowledge to distinguish which evidence\r\n    and opinion is stronger, then he must follow the scholarly opinion which has the strongest\r\n    support from the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah. It is acceptable for a Muslim to follow one of\r\n    the four well-known madhhabs, on the condition that he understands that the truth in any\r\n    given issue may lie with another madhhab, in which case he must ignore his own\r\n    madhhab&rsquo;s opinion and follow the truth. The Muslim&rsquo;s aim is to follow the truth\r\n    that is in accordance with the Qur&rsquo;an and Sunnah. The madhhabs of fiqh are only a\r\n    means of reaching <i>ahkaam<\/i> (rules) based on the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, they are not\r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah.<\/big><\/p>\r\n    <p><big>We ask Allaah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to\r\n    show us falsehood and help us to avoid it.

It was said that it is known \r\n    by the cessation of bleeding, which is when something inserted into the \r\n    vagina comes out dry; or it was said that it is when the white discharge \r\n    appears &ndash; this was the view favoured by al-Bukhaari.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This also indicates that the white discharge is a sign of the \r\n    end of the menses and the onset of the period of purity (tahaarah). The view \r\n    that it is known from the cessation of bleeding is countered by the fact \r\n    that a cloth may come out dry during the period and that does not mean that \r\n    the menses is over. This is unlike the white discharge which is emitted by \r\n    the uterus when the menses stops.

If he is able to learn how to pronounce it properly, then he must \r\n    do so, but if he is unable to do so and there is not enough time, he should \r\n    pray and make it up later on, but it is not permissible to follow him (in \r\n    prayer).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he is not able to learn or he has not had enough time \r\n    to learn, if that is in al-Faatihah then the prayer of others like him that \r\n    is offered behind him is valid, but if people who can pronounce it properly \r\n    pray behind him, it is like the prayer of a literate person offered behind \r\n    an illiterate person (i.e., the prayer is not valid). If it is in something \r\n    other than al-Faatihah then his prayer is valid, as is the prayer of those \r\n    who pray behind him. End quote from <i>Rawdat al-Taalibeen<\/i> (1\/350).<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &ldquo;If an \r\n    illiterate man leads another illiterate man and a literate man in prayer, \r\n    the literate man has to repeat his prayer&rdquo; &ndash; the illiterate man is one who \r\n    cannot recite al-Faatihah or part of it properly, or he mispronounces one \r\n    letter of it, even if he recites the rest of it well. It is not permissible \r\n    for one who can recite it well to be led by him in prayer, but it is \r\n    permissible for others like him to be led by him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then he said: Whoever omits one of the letters of al-Faatihah \r\n    because he is unable to pronounce it, or he substitutes another letter for \r\n    it, such as the person with a speech defect who substitutes ghayn for ra&rsquo;, \r\n    or who contracts one letter into another, or who recites with grammatical \r\n    mistakes that alter the meaning, like the one who uses the wrong vowel in \r\n    the word <i>iyaaka <\/i>and says <i>iyyaaki<\/i> instead, or says <i>an&rsquo;amtu<\/i> \r\n    instead of <i>an&rsquo;amta<\/i>, and cannot correct it &ndash; such a one is like an \r\n    illiterate person, and it is not permissible for a literate person to be led \r\n    by him in prayer, but it is permissible for any of them to lead another like \r\n    him in prayer, because they are both illiterate, so it is permissible for \r\n    one of them to be led by the other, like two who do not do a thing well. But \r\n    if he is able to correct any of that but he does not do so, then his prayer \r\n    is not valid and neither is the prayer of one who is led by him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said: It is makrooh for one who makes grammatical \r\n    mistakes when reciting but does not alter the meaning to lead the prayer. \r\n    This was stated by Ahmad, but it is valid for him to lead one who does not \r\n    make mistakes when reciting, because he has fulfilled the obligation of \r\n    reciting. If he alters the meaning in something other than al-Faatihah that \r\n    does not mean that his prayer is not valid and that he should not lead \r\n    others in prayer, unless he does it deliberately, in which case the prayer \r\n    of both is invalidated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If his mistakes do not change the meaning of the verses, then \r\n    it is permissible to pray behind him, but it is obligatory to teach him how \r\n    to recite properly. If his mistake is in something other than al-Faatihah, \r\n    it detracts from his prayer but does not invalidate it, but it is \r\n    undoubtedly better to pray behind one who recites properly, and it is not \r\n    permissible for those in authority to appoint such ignorant people to lead \r\n    the people in prayer otherwise they will have a share of the sin with them. \r\n    See: <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (3\/29-32)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &hellip; But if he makes mistakes, if his error is grammatical but \r\n    does not alter the meaning, then it is better to pray behind someone who \r\n    does not make grammatical mistakes if that is possible. But if his \r\n    grammatical mistakes in recitation al-Faatihah alter the meaning, then \r\n    prayer offered behind him is invalid. That is because of his mistakes, such \r\n    as saying <i>iyaaki na&rsquo;budu<\/i> instead of <i>iyaaka na&rsquo;budu<\/i> or saying\r\n    <i>an&rsquo;amtu &lsquo;alayhim<\/i> instead of <i>an&rsquo;amta &lsquo;alayhim<\/i> etc. If he makes \r\n    mistakes because he has not memorized it properly, then someone else who has \r\n    memorized it better is more entitled to lead the prayer than him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah li&rsquo;l-Buhooth al-&lsquo;Ilmiyyah \r\n    wa&rsquo;l-Ifta&rsquo;<\/i> (2\/527)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is an imam who makes grammatical mistakes when he \r\n    recites the Qur&rsquo;aan, and sometimes he adds to or takes away letters in the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aanic verses.

But if he accepts being taught and corrects his \r\n    recitation when corrected, then it is valid to pray behind him. What is \r\n    prescribed in all cases is for the Muslim to teach his brother both in \r\n    prayer and otherwise, because the Muslim is the brother of his fellow-Muslim \r\n    and he guides him if he makes a mistake and teaches him if he is ignorant \r\n    and corrects him if he makes a mistake when reciting the Qur&rsquo;aan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn Baaz<\/i> \r\n    (12\/98,99)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to repeating Ya Lateef one hundred times, \r\n    undoubtedly this is a bid&rsquo;ah (innovation) if a Muslim says it by itself, \r\n    because it is a phrase that makes no sense &ndash; it is a call to Allaah but what \r\n    comes after it?

We \r\n    have seen people who often get up in the night and stand on the minaret, \r\n    exhorting and reminding, and some of them recite soorahs from the Qur&rsquo;aan in \r\n    a loud voice, which keeps the people from sleeping, and confuse people who \r\n    are reciting Qur&rsquo;aan in their tahajjud.

A number of his brothers regarded this as something good and \r\n    he said to them: Would you like this salaam to be included with every \r\n    adhaan? They said: Yes. That night passed, and in the morning he claimed \r\n    that he had seen the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) in a dream and that he told him to go to the man in charge and \r\n    tell him that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    was telling him to order the muezzins to send salaams on the Messenger of \r\n    Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in every adhaan. So \r\n    he went to the man in charge of Cairo, who at that time was Najm al-Deen \r\n    Muhammad al-Tanbadi, who was an ignorant old man and was known for his bad \r\n    conduct and was known to care only for money even if that led him to doom, \r\n    and he was not ashamed to take bribes, and he did not care about the welfare \r\n    of the Muslims, and his ignorant ideas and bad deeds were well known, and he \r\n    said to him: The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) is telling you to order all the muezzins to add the words \r\n    Al-salaatu wa&rsquo;l-salaam &lsquo;alayka yaa rasool-Allaah (Blessings and peace be \r\n    upon you, O Messenger of Allaah) to every adhaan, as they do every Friday \r\n    night. The ignorant man liked this suggestion, and he was unaware that the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) does \r\n    not enjoin anything after his death except that which is in accordance with \r\n    what Allaah had prescribed on his lips during his lifetime, and that in His \r\n    Holy Book Allaah forbade adding anything to His laws, as He says \r\n    (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;Or have they partners with Allaah \r\n    (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not \r\n    ordained?&rdquo; [al-Shoora 42:21]<\/i>.&nbsp; And the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Beware of newly-invented \r\n    matters.&rdquo; So he issued orders to that effect in Sha&rsquo;baan of the year \r\n    mentioned, and this innovation was introduced fully, and it has lasted until \r\n    our own times in all areas of Egypt and Syria, and the common folk and \r\n    ignorant people think that this is part of the adhaan which it is not \r\n    permissible to omit. That has led to some of the heretics in some villages \r\n    adding after the adhaan salaam to some people who have died. There is no \r\n    power and no strength except with Allaah.

If there appears to be a contradiction with \r\n          reality, it is either because what we think is reality is a&nbsp; baseless \r\n          claim, or the (text of) the Qur&rsquo;aan&nbsp; is not opposed to this reality \r\n          in a clear and definite manner. The unambiguous statements of the Qur&rsquo;aan \r\n          and the facts of reality are both definitive, and two definitive things \r\n          can never contradict one another.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>Based on the above, it may be said that now they (doctors) \r\n          are able, through the use of precise machines, to discover what is in \r\n          the wombs and to find out whether it is male or female. If what is said \r\n          is false, then there is no point in discussing it. If it is true, then \r\n          it does not contradict the aayah, because the aayah is referring to \r\n          a matter of the unseen, which has to do with the knowledge of Allaah \r\n          about these five matters. The matters of the unseen as far as the foetus \r\n          are concerned are: how long he will remain in his mother&rsquo;s womb, his \r\n          life, his deeds, his provision, whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) \r\n          or blessed (destined for Paradise), and &ndash; before it is fully formed \r\n          &ndash; whether it will be male or female. But after it has been fully formed, \r\n          knowledge of whether it is male or female is no longer the matter of \r\n          the unseen, because once it has been fully formed it becomes the matter \r\n          of the visible world, but it remains within the three layers of darkness \r\n          which, if they were removed, it would be known what it is. It is not \r\n          far-fetched to think that among the things that Allaah has created are \r\n          powerful rays which can penetrate these layers of darkness so that it \r\n          may become clear whether the foetus is male or female. The aayah does \r\n          not clearly refer to knowledge of whether the foetus is male or female, \r\n          and the Sunnah does not refer to that either.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>With regard to what the questioner refers to, that Ibn \r\n          Jareer quoted from Mujaahid that a man asked the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what his wife would give \r\n          birth to, and Allaah revealed this aayah, this narration is <i>munqati&rsquo;<\/i> \r\n          (interrupted), because Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) was one \r\n          of the Taabi&rsquo;een.&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The <i>tafseer<\/i> of Qutaadah (may Allaah have mercy \r\n          on him) may be interpreted as meaning that Allaah Alone has knowledge \r\n          of that so long as it has not yet been fully formed. But once the foetus \r\n          is fully formed, then others may have knowledge of it. Ibn Katheer (may \r\n          Allaah have mercy on him) said in his tafseer of the aayah from <i>Soorat \r\n          Luqmaan<\/i>: &ldquo;No one knows what Allaah wants to create in the wombs \r\n          apart from Him, but once He decrees that it should be male or female, \r\n          doomed or blessed, the angels who are appointed in charge of it know \r\n          that, and whoever else He wills among His creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; <\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>With regard to your question about what may make the \r\n          general meaning of this aayah (&ldquo;what is in the wombs&rdquo;) more specific, \r\n          we say that if the aayah was speaking about being male or female after \r\n          the foetus is fully formed, then that which would make it more specific \r\n          would be tangible facts.

The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, &ldquo;Take off the \r\n          cloak and wash off the perfume, and do in your &lsquo;umrah what you do in \r\n          your Hajj.&rdquo; He did not tell him to pay a penalty (fidyah) for his ignorance. \r\n          By the same token, some matters which may be unclear should be taught \r\n          to the one who is ignorant so that he will come to understand them. \r\n          But as far as the basics of &lsquo;aqeedah, the pillars of Islam, and things \r\n          which are clearly haraam are concerned, claims of ignorance cannot be \r\n          accepted from anyone who lives among the Muslims. If anyone who lives \r\n          among the Muslims were to say, &ldquo;I did not know that zinaa is haraam&rdquo;, \r\n          this is no excuse.

Or if he were to say, &ldquo;I did not know that homosexuality \r\n          is haraam,&rdquo; this is no excuse.

The correct view is that they will be tested on the Day of \r\n          Resurrection: if they respond and obey they will enter Paradise, and \r\n          if they disobey they will enter Hell.

I do not think that this \r\n    forcing her not to wear hijab can take place unless the woman leaves her \r\n    home, but if she stays at home no one can force her, so she can stay in her \r\n    house so that she will be safe from this thing.

So no one should be brought to work in \r\n    the house or to raise the children except Muslim women only. The same \r\n    applies to men; only Muslims should be brought in and not non-Muslims, \r\n    because they cause a great deal of harm and because their beliefs and \r\n    attitudes are not the same as the beliefs and attitudes of Muslims. So it is \r\n    essential to avoid bringing them in so as to avoid the evil that may be \r\n    caused by following their example and mixing with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, it is not permissible for any religion but one to \r\n    remain in the Arabian Peninsula; there should not be two religions in it. \r\n    But these servants and workers may stay there for a long time because of \r\n    work or because of wanting to work. It is not permissible to bring \r\n    non-Muslims into the Arabian Peninsula, because the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Expel the Jews and Christians from the \r\n    Arabian Peninsula.&rdquo; And according to another version he said: &ldquo;Expel the \r\n    mushrikeen (polytheists).&rdquo; And he left instructions to that effect when he \r\n    died (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So it is not permissible \r\n    for a Muslim to bring in anyone but Muslim men and women into the Arabian \r\n    Peninsula, and not anyone else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    No one should be brought into the Arabian peninsula except \r\n    Muslims, as we have stated above, because the Messenger (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) enjoined that the mushrikeen, Jews and Christians \r\n    should be expelled from it and only one religion should be left in it, \r\n    because it is the cradle of Islam and because the Muslims pin their hopes on \r\n    it after Allah, and take it as an example. Therefore if non-Muslims are \r\n    brought in, that opens the door to other people bringing in non-Muslims and \r\n    mixing with them, and this will cause a great deal of harm to all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to offering food to them:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is not permissible to offer food to them.

If they are kuffaar, even if they fast their fast will \r\n    not be valid. However, the minor issues of sharee&lsquo;ah are addressed to them, \r\n    and if that is addressed to them it is not permissible to help them in that \r\n    which will go against sharee&lsquo;ah. Rather they should be advised and taught in \r\n    the hope that they might become Muslim. So they should be called to Islam \r\n    and told about what is good and right in the hope that they might become \r\n    Muslim, then one will attain a reward like theirs. &ldquo;The one who tells \r\n    another about something good will have a reward like that of the one who \r\n    does it.&rdquo; &ldquo;If one man were to be guided through you that would be better for \r\n    you than having red camels (the best kind).&rdquo; This is what the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If they insist, then they are the ones who should make their \r\n    own food. They are the ones who should take care of their own needs in this \r\n    regard, in the hope that they may be influenced by this and become Muslim. \r\n    Otherwise their contracts should be cancelled and Allah will bring someone \r\n    better than them. He should not take this matter lightly and if they decide \r\n    to leave the job, then praise be to Allah, they have given up the job and \r\n    Allah will bring people better than them. So he should never help them in \r\n    this matter; he should not help them to find food and drink in Ramadan, \r\n    whether they are kaafirs or evildoers (faasiq) among the Muslims who do not \r\n    fast. They should not help them to eat or drink in Ramadan or help them to \r\n    do anything that Allah has forbidden. They can do it for themselves and buy \r\n    what they need themselves.

If he did not \r\n          know the truth of the matter, then only one who seized it in the first \r\n          place is responsible for replacing it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          If the seized property is of a \r\n          type that is usually rented out, then the one who seized it has to pay \r\n          rent for property of that type for the period during which he kept it, \r\n          because the benefit is something that is to be measured in monetary \r\n          terms, so he has to repay that as well as returning the property itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          All of the ways in which the one \r\n          who seized the property has disposed of it are null and void, because \r\n          he did not have the permission of the owner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          If something is seized and the \r\n          owner is not known, and it cannot be returned to him, then he should \r\n          hand it over to the governor who can restore it to its rightful place, \r\n          or he can give it in charity on behalf of its owner; if he gives it \r\n          in charity then the reward for that will go to the owner.

He said: Niyyah is exactly qasd but there \r\n    are two differences between it and qasd:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Qasd may be connected to the action of the doer himself \r\n    or the action of others, whereas niyyah is connected only to his own \r\n    actions.

Hence in the hadeeth of \r\n    Abu Kabshah al-Anmaari, which was narrated by Ahmad, al-Tirmidhi and others, \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There \r\n    are four types of people in this world: a man to whom Allaah gives wealth \r\n    and knowledge, so he fears his Lord with regard to the way in which he \r\n    disposes of his wealth, and he uses it to uphold ties of kinship and he \r\n    realizes that Allaah has rights over it. This man occupies the highest \r\n    status. And a man to whom Allaah has given knowledge but did not give him \r\n    wealth, so he says, &lsquo;If I had wealth I would have done the same as So and so \r\n    is doing.&rsquo; So he will be rewarded according to his intention [niyyah] and \r\n    the reward of both of them is the same. And a person to whom Allaah has \r\n    given wealth but not knowledge. That is the worst status before Allaah. Then \r\n    he said: A person to whom Allaah has given neither wealth nor knowledge, and \r\n    he says: &lsquo;If I had money I would have done what So and so is doing&rsquo;. So he \r\n    will be judged&nbsp; according to his intention [niyyah], and the burden (of sin) \r\n    of both of them will be the same.&rdquo; So niyyah has to do with that which is \r\n    possible and that which is not possible, unlike qasd (objectives) and \r\n    iraadah (will), which have nothing to do with that which is not possible, \r\n    whether it is one&rsquo;s actions or the actions of another.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Badaa&rsquo;i&rsquo; al-Fawaa&rsquo;id<\/i> (3\/190).

It is sufficient for \r\n    you to know that one of the most important principles is that matters are \r\n    judged by their aims and objectives, which is based on the words of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;Actions are but \r\n    by intention and each person will have but that which he intended.&rdquo; \r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1) and Muslim (1907).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: You should \r\n    know that there are plenty of reports from the imams which speak of the \r\n    great importance of the hadeeth about intention (niyyah).

Imam al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ibn Mahdi, Ibn \r\n    al-Madeeni, Abu Dawood, al-Daaraqutni and others were agreed that it is \r\n    one-third of knowledge, and some of them said that it is one-quarter \r\n    thereof. Al-Bayhaqi based its being one-third of knowledge on the fact that \r\n    a person earns reward by the actions of his heart, tongue and physical \r\n    faculties, so intention (niyyah) is one of these three categories and the \r\n    most important of them, because it may be an independent act of worship, and \r\n    the others need it. &hellip; al-Shaafa&rsquo;i said: It may be entered through seventy \r\n    doors.

What \r\n          should be borne in mind is what the word haa&rsquo;it (wall) refers to in \r\n          linguistic terms; if a person merely places stones, piles of dirt or \r\n          a small wall around the land which does not keep anyone out, or he digs \r\n          a ditch around it, then he does not take possession of it, but he will \r\n          have more right to revitalize it than anyone else, and he is not permitted \r\n          to sell it unless he revitalizes it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          (2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><span>&nbsp;If he digs a well \r\n          on the disused land and reaches water, then he has revitalized it.

But \r\n          the recipient does not become the owner of the land just because he \r\n          has been given it, unless he revitalizes it, but he has more right to \r\n          it than others, so if he revitalizes it, it becomes his, and if he is \r\n          unable to revitalize it, the ruler can take it back and give it to someone \r\n          else who is able to revitalize it. &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah \r\n          be pleased with him) took back land from those who were unable to revitalize \r\n          it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Whoever reaches a permissible thing first &ndash; apart from \r\n          disused land &ndash; such as game [animals or birds for hunting] or wood, \r\n          then he has more right to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          If water that is permissible for everybody (i.e., water \r\n          that is not owned by anybody) passes through people&rsquo;s lands, such as \r\n          a river or the water of a wadi, then the owner of the higher land has \r\n          the right to use the water for irrigation and to withhold it until it \r\n          reaches the ankles, then he should let it flow to people further on, \r\n          and so on in turn. The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Irrigate (your land), \r\n          O Zubayr, then withhold the water until it reaches the walls between \r\n          the pits round the trees&rdquo; (agreed upon). &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq quoted Mu&rsquo;ammar \r\n          al-Zuhri as saying, &ldquo;We looked at the words of the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &lsquo;then withhold the water \r\n          until it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees,&rsquo; and it \r\n          came up to the ankles.&rdquo; In other words, they worked it out from the \r\n          story and found that it came up to the ankles, so they made that the \r\n          standard for deciding how much the first one should take, then the next \r\n          one, and so on. Abu Dawood and others narrated from &lsquo;Amr ibn Shu&rsquo;ayb \r\n          that the Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ruled concerning the waterway \r\n          of Mazoor (a well known wadi in Madeenah) that the (owner of the) higher \r\n          (land) should withhold the water until it reached the ankles, then the \r\n          (owner of the) higher (land) should let it flow to the lower (land).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          But if the water is owned, it should be divided among \r\n          the owners based on the size of their land, and each of them may dispose \r\n          of his share as he wishes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The leader of the Muslims has the right to protect the \r\n          grazing lands of the flocks belonging to the Bayt al-Maal (treasury) \r\n          of the Muslims, such as horses used for jihad and camels given in charity, \r\n          so long as that will not harm the people by making things difficult \r\n          for them. Ibn &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the \r\n          Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" -->\r\n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) protected (the land of) \r\n          al-Naqee&rsquo; for the horses of the Muslims.

Hence we will limit \r\n    ourselves to quoting his words. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>This principle is one of the basic fiqhi \r\n    principles which are indicated by sharee&rsquo;ah: Everything that is forbidden \r\n    becomes permissible in the case of necessity.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>So what is forbidden becomes permissible in \r\n    the case of necessity, but there are two conditions.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The first condition:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>We should be compelled to do this specific \r\n    haraam thing, meaning that we cannot find anything with which to meet that \r\n    necessity except this haraam thing. If we can find something else, then it \r\n    does not become permissible, even though it could meet our necessity.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The second condition:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The necessity should be met by that haraam \r\n    thing; if that is not the case, then it remains haraam. If we are not \r\n    certain whether it will meet the necessity or not, then it also remains \r\n    haraam. That is because doing something haraam is definitely wrong and \r\n    meeting necessity by means of it is something concerning which there is \r\n    doubt, so we should not transgress by doing that which is definitely haraam \r\n    for the sake of something concerning which there is doubt.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Hence the ruling varies concerning a \r\n    starving man who cannot find anything but dead meat. In this case we say, \r\n    Eat the dead meat. If he says that this is committing a haraam action, we \r\n    say that it has become permissible because of necessity, because you have \r\n    nothing else to eat apart from this and because if you eat it you will meet \r\n    that necessity.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>It was said to a man: If you drink alcohol, \r\n    you will be cured of sickness. In this case we say: It is not permissible \r\n    for you to drink alcohol even if you are told that it will heal you from \r\n    sickness. Why is that?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Firstly, because there is no certainty that \r\n    he will be healed by it; he may drink it and not be healed of sickness. We \r\n    see many sick people taking beneficial medicines that they do not benefit \r\n    from.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Secondly, the sick person may recover \r\n    without any treatment, by putting his trust in Allah and praying to Him, and \r\n    by means of people&rsquo;s prayer (du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;) for him and so on. This is from the \r\n    point of view of reason.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>From the point of view of evidence, it is \r\n    narrated in a hadeeth from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) that he said: &ldquo;Allaah does not put your healing in that which He has \r\n    forbidden to you.&rdquo; The rationale behind this hadeeth is clear, because Allah \r\n    only forbade it to us because it is harmful to us, so how can that which is \r\n    haraam be a healing and a remedy?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Hence it is haraam to use haraam things as \r\n    treatment, as the scholars have stated, and it cannot be said that this is a \r\n    case of necessity, as some people think.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If someone were to say that a person is \r\n    choking and he has nothing except a cup of wine, so is it permissible for \r\n    him to drink this cup to stop him choking?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The answer is yes, because the two \r\n    conditions are met in this case. He is compelled to use this exact thing and \r\n    we are certain that the necessity will be met by it, so we would say: Drink \r\n    the wine. But once the choking has stopped, he should stop drinking.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If someone were to say that a man found some \r\n    meat that had been slaughtered in the halaal manner and some meat from an \r\n    animal that had died a natural death, can he eat the dead meat because he is \r\n    forced to do so by necessity?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The answer is that he cannot do that, \r\n    because the necessity can be met by something else, so it is not permissible \r\n    because the first condition is not met.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If a person were to say, I am thirsty and I \r\n    have nothing but a cup of wine; can I drink it?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The answer is no, as the scholars said, \r\n    because this is not a case of necessity; rather it will only make him more \r\n    thirsty, so there is no benefit in transgressing and doing something haraam, \r\n    because necessity will not be warded off by it and the second condition is \r\n    not fulfilled.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>If a person were to say: If a sick person \r\n    has no choice but to drink blood as a remedy, is it permissible for him to \r\n    do that? The answer is that it is not permissible for him to do that, \r\n    because the two conditions are not met.

These are great hopes \r\n    that can be achieved through faith, as it was narrated that Sufyaan al-Thawri said: Faith is not wishes or pretence, rather it is what settles in \r\n    the heart and is proven by actions.&rdquo; So we will discuss the matter of faith and how important it is in becoming a devoted slave, pleasing and \r\n    honouring one&rsquo;s parents and achieving the victory of Paradise.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whoever seeks to achieve great things has to \r\n    stay up at night (worship). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hence al-Fudayl said: &ldquo;You hearts can never \r\n    taste the sweetness of faith until they shun worldly pleasures.&rdquo; And he also said, &ldquo;If you cannot pray qiyaam at night and fast during the day, \r\n    then know that you are deprived.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The sincere believer has a heart like a \r\n    burning coal, hence it was narrated by al-Haakim in his <i>Mustadrak<\/i> and al-Tabaraani in his <i>Mu&rsquo;jam<\/i> with a saheeh isnaad that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Faith wears out in your heart as clothes wear out, so ask Allaah to renew the \r\n    faith in your hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The believer&rsquo;s heart may sometimes feel \r\n    overwhelmed by clouds of sin. This was portrayed to us by the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he said: &ldquo;There is no \r\n    heart that does not have clouds like the clouds that cover the moon. When the cloud covers it, it is dark, and when the cloud moves away it \r\n    shines.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tabaraani in <i>al-Awsat<\/i>, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. So the believer&rsquo;s heart is sometimes covered with a \r\n    cloud and its light is hidden, and it remains dark and lonely, but if he strives to increase his store of faith and seeks the help of Allaah, that \r\n    cloud goes away and the light in his heart starts to shine again. Hence one of the salaf said: &ldquo;It is part of a person&rsquo;s smartness to c heck on \r\n    his faith and be aware of what affects it.&rdquo; It is also part of a person&rsquo;s smartness &ldquo;that he recognizes how the Shaytaan whispers to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So he has to come back to faith. If you come \r\n    back to faith and do as it requires, then you will achieve what you want. We will tell you of a basic principle which will let you know when faith \r\n    is present and when it is not. Imam Ibn al-Jawzi said: &ldquo;O you who are turned away, O you who are deprived of meeting your loved ones, if you want \r\n    to know how you stand before the king, then look at how you are spending your time and what work you are assigned to do. How many people stand at \r\n    the door of the king, but no one enters except the one whom he cares for.&nbsp; Not every heart is fit to draw close, not every heart can be filled \r\n    with love, not every wind is like the morning breeze.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If a person want to know how he stands before \r\n    Allaah and how he stands in relation to His commands and prohibitions, let him look at himself and see what he is preoccupied with. If he is busy \r\n    with da&rsquo;wah and with saving people from the Fire, striving to attain Paradise, helping the weak and needy, honouring his parents, then let him \r\n    rejoice in the fact that he is close to the King of kings, for Allaah does not help anyone to do good except those whom He loves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;But if he is has no interest in da&rsquo;wah, \r\n    dislikes the daa&rsquo;iyahs and does not do good things, if he is preoccupied with this world and its gains, and with gossip and asking too many \r\n    questions, whilst not doing much or following his whims and desires, let him know that he is far from Allaah and has been deprived of that which \r\n    will bring him closer to Paradise, because Allaah says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>&ldquo;Whoever desires the quick-passing \r\n    (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.

Mujaahid said: When the sun passes its zenith everything prostrates \r\n    to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Allaah has confirmed that all beings prostrate to Him, and He \r\n    has explained how some of them prostrate, which is by the inclining of its \r\n    shadow towards the right and the left. It does not mean that everything \r\n    prostrates on seven parts of the body; that applies only to the Muslims. The \r\n    prostration of all other beings is in accordance with their nature. The fact \r\n    that this prostration is prostration in the real sense is indicated by the \r\n    apparent meaning of the text, because there is no valid reason for not \r\n    interpreting the text as it appears to be, so we must accept it. That is \r\n    also supported by the fact that the prostration of the sun, moon, stars, \r\n    trees and animals is mentioned in conjunction with the prostration of the \r\n    angels and humans, which indicates that this is prostration in a real sense \r\n    for all the entities mentioned. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Prostration is a form of humility, so the prostration which \r\n    includes all creatures implies the utmost submission and humility. For every \r\n    created thing submits to His greatness and humbles itself before His might \r\n    and power. This does not mean that everything prostrates like human beings \r\n    do, on seven parts of the body, putting the forehead on the ground. This \r\n    kind of prostration is only for human beings. Some other nations bow but do \r\n    not prostrate, and that is their prostration. Allaah says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&lsquo;and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with \r\n    humility) and say: &ldquo;Forgive us&rdquo;&rsquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:58]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It was said that this \r\n    means enter it bowing, and some of them prostrate on their sides like the \r\n    Jews. Sujood (prostration) is a generic term but because the way in which \r\n    Muslims prostrate is so well known, many people think that this is how \r\n    everything prostrates.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Jaami&rsquo; al-Rasaa&rsquo;il<\/i>, 1\/27&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is known that \r\n    everything prostrates according to its nature, and the prostration of these \r\n    created entities does not mean that they put their foreheads on the ground.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 21\/284&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This prostration includes the submission and humbling of \r\n    these created entities to Allaah and their surrendering to His Lordship, \r\n    Might and Sovereignty. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;It is the prostration of \r\n    humility and submission, for everything submits to His Lordship, humbles \r\n    itself before His Might and is subject to His Sovereignty.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Madaarij al-Saalikeen<\/i>, 1\/107&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The prostration of these created entities is a prostration in \r\n    a real sense as befits each of these entities. So man prostrates in the \r\n    manner that suits him, in the manner that is well known, on seven parts of \r\n    the body. The sun prostrates in the manner that suits it, as mentioned in \r\n    the saheeh hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: \r\n    &ldquo;The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu \r\n    Dharr when the sun had set, &lsquo;Do you know where it went?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Allaah and \r\n    His Messenger know best.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;It has gone to prostrate beneath the \r\n    Throne, then it asks for permission to rise, but soon it will prostrate and \r\n    its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask for permission to rise \r\n    and that will not be granted to it, and it will be said to it, &ldquo;Go back from \r\n    whence you came,&rdquo; and it will rise from the west. This is what Allaah says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term \r\n    (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Yaa-Seen 36:38]<\/i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3199)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So it prostrates in a real sense, as is suited to the sun, \r\n    but how does it prostrate to Allaah beneath the Throne? Allaah knows best \r\n    how this prostration happens. The apparent meaning of the hadeeth proves \r\n    that what this prostration means is not simply submission to the command of \r\n    Allaah and obedience to Him. Indeed, it is submission, humility and \r\n    surrender by prostrating in a real sense, but we do not understand how it \r\n    happens. Similarly it is said that the moon, the trees, the animals and all \r\n    other entities prostrate in a manner that suits them. What the believer \r\n    should do is not to let the fact that he does not know how some entities \r\n    prostrate prevent him from believing in this prostration, rather he must \r\n    believe in what Allaah has told him about other entities prostrating to Him.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4225","question_id":"4225","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The woman who suffers istihaadah (ongoing irregular vaginal \r\n    bleeding) and the one who has a problem which means that he or she cannot \r\n    keep wudoo&rsquo;&nbsp; has to do wudoo' at the time of every prayer according to the \r\n    majority of fuqaha&rsquo;, and the end of the time for prayer invalidates wudoo' \r\n    in the case of such people.

It comes out following urination, when one is constipated, or when \r\n    carrying something heavy, and it comes out in the form of one or two drops \r\n    and the like. The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not required to \r\n    do ghusl when madhiy and wadiy are emitted.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Majmoo&lsquo;<\/i>, 2\/160&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah preserve him) was asked: At the \r\n    end of urination, I notice some seminal fluid (maniy) coming out, and I do \r\n    not know whether I have to do ghusl every time I urinate, or what should I \r\n    do? Because I am not sure whether it has the same effect as intercourse?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: This &ldquo;maniy&rdquo; that comes out after urination is \r\n    wadiy, which is well known (and is not actually maniy). As it comes out \r\n    after urination and comes out in a stream (as opposed to gushing out), it \r\n    does not necessitate ghusl. However it does invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, so the penis \r\n    should be washed after that, then one should do wudoo&rsquo;, but it is not \r\n    necessary to do ghusl. Ghusl is only required when maniy gushes out in \r\n    spurts accompanied by feelings of pleasure, and is not required otherwise. \r\n    As gushing out in spurts forcefully is not like the emission of urine, which \r\n    comes out in a stream or in drops, it does not matter if it comes out like \r\n    that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, 1\/226&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When you have relieved yourself, you have to wait until you \r\n    are certain that the flow has stopped, then clean yourself and do wudoo&rsquo;. If \r\n    that leads to you missing the prayer in congregation, there is no blame on \r\n    you. But you should get ready for the prayer before the time comes, so long \r\n    as you know that you need a long time to relieve yourself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: There \r\n    is a man who suffers from urinary incontinence. He purifies himself some \r\n    time after urinating, but if he were to wait until the incontinence ends, \r\n    the time for the prayer in congregation would be over. What is the ruling?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied: If he knows that the incontinence will end, it \r\n    is not permissible for him to pray when it is still affecting him, seeking \r\n    the virtue of praying in congregation. Rather he has to wait until it ends, \r\n    then he should clean himself after that, then do wudoo&rsquo; and offer his \r\n    prayer, even if he misses the prayer in congregation. However he should \r\n    hasten to clean himself and do wudoo&rsquo; once the time for the prayer has \r\n    begun, in the hope that he will be able to pray in congregation.

So do wudoo&rsquo; half an hour or so before the time for prayer \r\n    begins, after you have urinated and the effects of urination have ceased, in \r\n    the hope that it will stop before the time for prayer comes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly, after urinating you have to wash your private part \r\n    with cold water that will stop urination and prevent drops coming out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If these drops are the result of waswaas (whispers from the \r\n    Shaytaan) or something imaginary, then after cleaning yourself you should \r\n    sprinkle water on your pants or thobe, so that the Shaytaan cannot make you \r\n    imagine, if you see dampness, that it is urine, because you will know that \r\n    it is water that you put on your garment.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa Islamiyyah<\/i>, 1\/196&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should beware of waswasah (whispers from the Shaytaan), \r\n    for it is a disease and an evil that can cause a person to worry and \r\n    generate doubt in his mind, making worship burdensome for him. So beware of \r\n    that. When you have relieved yourself, done wudoo&rsquo; and prayed, do not pay \r\n    any attention to doubts, because the basic principle is that one is pure and \r\n    that prayers are valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: When I have finished wudoo&rsquo; and am going to pray, I feel a drop of \r\n    urine coming out of the penis; what should I do?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who is affected with that should ignore it, as \r\n    enjoined by the leading scholars of the Muslims. He should not pay any \r\n    attention to it or go and check whether anything came out or not. By Allah&rsquo;s \r\n    leave, if he seeks refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan and ignores \r\n    it, it will go away. But if he is utterly certain about it, then it is \r\n    essential to wash whatever the urine has gotten onto, then repeat his wudoo&rsquo; \r\n    because some people, if they feel coldness at the tip of the penis, think \r\n    that something has come out. But if you are certain, you should do what I \r\n    told you. What you have mentioned is not incontinence, because it stops, \r\n    whereas incontinence is ongoing. As for this, it is one or two drops that \r\n    come out after moving; this is not incontinence because two drops come out \r\n    then it stops. In this case you should wash yourself and do wudoo&rsquo; again. \r\n    You should always do this, and be patient and seek reward with Allah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Liqa&rsquo; al-Baab al-Maftooh<\/i>, 184\/15&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4231","question_id":"4231","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We ask Allaah to heal you \r\n    and reward you for what has befallen you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If the medicine is harming \r\n    you and affecting your bones, then there is nothing wrong with stopping it, \r\n    because you do not have to take that which will harm you, whether it is \r\n    medicine or anything else.

This is like the \r\n    case of one who cannot find a garment to cover his awrah in prayer; it is \r\n    permissible for him to pray without a garment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If someone can help you to do ghusl or wduoo&rsquo;, then all well \r\n    and good, and that will suffice you for the rest of the day so long as you \r\n    do not break that wudoo&rsquo; in any way.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you do tayammum for yourself or if someone else does it \r\n    for you, it is sufficient to pass your hand over the dust, and wipe whatever \r\n    you can of your face.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You may also &ndash; because of hardship and sickness &ndash; put two \r\n    prayers together if it is difficult for you to do wudoo&rsquo; at the time of the \r\n    second prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is not easy for you to do wudoo&rsquo; or tayammum until the \r\n    time for the prayer is nearly over, then you have to pray even if you did \r\n    not purify yourself with either water or dust.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence that it is permissible for a man to pray even if \r\n    he cannot purify himself is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah borrowed a necklace from \r\n    &lsquo;Asma&rsquo; and lost it. The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) sent a man to find it, then the time for prayer came but \r\n    they did not have any water, so they prayed then complained about that to \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \r\n    Then Allaah revealed the verse of tayammum. Usayd ibn Hudayr said to \r\n    &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, &ldquo;May Allaah reward you with good, for by Allaah there has never \r\n    happened to you anything that you dislike but Allaah brought something good \r\n    for you and for the Muslims through it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 329; Muslim, 367)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In a report narrated by al-Tabaraani and Abu &lsquo;Awwaanah, it \r\n    states clearly that they prayed without wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Usayd ibn Hudayr and \r\n    some others to look for a necklace that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah had lost. The time for \r\n    prayer came and they prayed without wudoo&rsquo;. When they came to the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) they complained to him \r\n    about that, then the verse of tayammum was revealed.&rdquo; Al-Nufayli added: And \r\n    Usayd ibn Hudayr said: &ldquo;May Allaah reward you with good, for by Allaah there \r\n    has never happened to you anything that you dislike but Allaah granted \r\n    relief for you and for the Muslims through it.&rdquo; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Abu Awwaanah, 873; al-Tabaraani, 131.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This indicates that in the absence of water &ndash; which was the \r\n    only means of purification before tayammum &ndash; it is permissible to pray \r\n    without wudoo&rsquo;, so it is more apt that it is permissible to pray in the \r\n    absence of dust which is of a lower status than water.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From this it may be understood that the person who is unable \r\n    to purify himself &ndash; whether that is because there is no means of \r\n    purification or because he is unable to find it or is unable to use it if it \r\n    is present &ndash; is permitted to pray without purifying himself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled, <i>\r\n    Baab idha lam yajid maa&rsquo;an wa laa turaaban<\/i> (Chapter: if there is no \r\n    water or dust).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Rasheed said: It is as if the author is stating that \r\n    tayammum is not prescribed if there is no dust, and that was after tayammum \r\n    had been prescribed. It is as if he is saying that their ruling concerning \r\n    the lack of the means of purification &ndash; which was water only &ndash; was the same \r\n    as our ruling on cases when neither of the two means of purification, water \r\n    and dust, is available. Hence we know that this hadeeth is suited to the \r\n    heading, even though the hadeeth does not say that they had no dust, rather \r\n    it says that they had no water. This indicates that prayer is obligatory for \r\n    the one who has neither of the two means of purification, because the \r\n    hadeeth shows that they prayed believing that it was obligatory to do so. If \r\n    praying in such circumstances were not allowed, then the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have told them off for doing so. \r\n    This is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, Ahmad, the majority of muhadditheen and \r\n    most of the companions of Maalik.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 1\/440.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If no dust is available, this is as if tayammum is not \r\n    prescribed, and there is no difference. They prayed without doing tayammum \r\n    because tayammum had not been prescribed at that time. The same applies to \r\n    one who prays without tayammum because he does not have the material with \r\n    which to do tayammum. What is the difference between not having it and it \r\n    not being prescribed? According to analogy (qiyaas) and the Sunnah, the one \r\n    who does not have it should pray according to his circumstances, for Allaah \r\n    does not burden any soul beyond its scope. And he should not repeat the \r\n    prayer, because he did what he was commanded to do so he does not have to \r\n    repeat it. This is similar to the case of one who does not stand or face the \r\n    qiblah or cover himself or recite because he is unable to do so. This is \r\n    what is implied by the texts and by analogy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim &lsquo;ala Tahdheeb Sunan Abi Dawood<\/i>, \r\n    1\/61.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Because it is one of the conditions of prayer which is waived \r\n    when one is unable to do it, as is the case with all the other conditions \r\n    and pillars (essential parts) of the prayer. And he did what he was obliged \r\n    to do as best he could, so he does not have to repeat it. This is like the \r\n    one who is unable to cover himself and prays naked; or one who is unable to \r\n    face the qiblah so he prays facing a different direction; or one who is \r\n    unable to stand so he prays sitting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/157.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Shawkaani said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the phrase &ldquo;so they prayed without wudoo&rsquo;&rdquo;, a \r\n    number of scholars, including the compiler, understood this to mean that it \r\n    is obligatory to pray even if neither of the two means of purification, \r\n    water and dust, is available. It does not say in the hadeeth that they had \r\n    no dust, rather it says only that they had no water, but the lack of water \r\n    at that time was like the lack of water and dust, because there was no means \r\n    of purification other than water. The point is that they prayed believing it \r\n    to be obligatory to do so.

He has no excuse for not \r\n          doing so and for doing tayammum instead. In that case his prayer will \r\n          be incorrect, because he has omitted one of the conditions of prayer, \r\n          which is purifying oneself with water when one is able to do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Many of the Bedouin &ndash; may Allaah guide them &ndash; and others \r\n          who go for trips use tayammum, when there is a lot of water available \r\n          and it is easy to access it. This is undoubtedly serious carelessness \r\n          and an abhorrent action which is not permissible because it goes against \r\n          the shar&rsquo;i evidence. Rather the Muslim is excused for doing tayammum \r\n          if water is far away or he has only a small amount of water which he \r\n          needs to keep himself and his family, and livestock alive, and the source \r\n          of water is too far away. Every Muslim, wherever he is, has to fear \r\n          Allaah in all his affairs; he has to adhere to His commands, which include \r\n          doing wudoo&rsquo; with water when one is able to.

For placing \r\n          dust on the head is something that is ordinarily disliked, rather it \r\n          is customarily done at times of disaster and calamity, and the feet \r\n          are usually in contact with the dust anyway. But putting dust in the \r\n          face is an action of humility and veneration of Allaah, submission to \r\n          Him and humbling oneself before Allaah, which is one of the most beloved \r\n          of acts of worship to Him and one of the most beneficial to the person \r\n          himself. Hence it is mustahabb (liked, encouraged) for the one who is \r\n          prostrating to get dust on his face for the sake of Allaah, and not \r\n          to protect his face from getting dusty. One of the Sahaabah saw a man \r\n          prostrating and putting something between his face and the dust, and \r\n          he said to him: &ldquo;Get your face dusty.&rdquo; This meaning does not apply in \r\n          the case of getting the feet dusty.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>Moreover, this is appropriate \r\n          by analogy in another sense, which is that tayammum applies to the parts \r\n          of the body which are washed during wudoo&rsquo;, but not to the parts which \r\n          are merely wiped. For the feet may be wiped when one is wearing socks, \r\n          and the head may be wiped when one is wearing a turban. Since the parts \r\n          which are usually washed are reduced to wiping (in the case of tayammum), \r\n          the parts which are wiped are reduced to nothing, because if we were \r\n          to wipe the latter with dust, that would not be a reduction at all, \r\n          rather instead of wiping them with water we would just be wiping them \r\n          with dust. Thus it becomes clear that what sharee&rsquo;ah tells us is the \r\n          most fair and the most perfect. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          <span>The tayammum of the one who \r\n          is in a state of junub (major impurity following sexual activity) is \r\n          like the tayammum of the one who is in a state of minor impurity. If \r\n          the one who is in a state of minor impurity is spared the obligation \r\n          of wiping the head and feet with dust, then it is more appropriate that \r\n          the one who is in a state of major impurity should be spared the obligation \r\n          of rubbing his whole body with dust, because that would involve a great \r\n          deal of hardship, and it goes against the idea of tayammum being a dispensation. \r\n          It would also reduce the one who is the noblest of Allaah&rsquo;s creation \r\n          to becoming like the animals who rub their bodies in the dust. That \r\n          which was brought by sharee&rsquo;ah cannot be superceded in wisdom and fairness, \r\n          and to Allaah be praise.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n        <br \/><br \/>Source: A&rsquo;laam al-Muwaqqi&rsquo;een, 1\/301, 302."},{"id":"4243","question_id":"4243","answers":"<h1><big><span>Praise \r\n          be to Allaah. <\/span><\/big>&nbsp;<\/h1>\r\n        <p> \r\n          Ibn Hajar al-Haythami was asked this question and he \r\n          replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n        <p> \r\n          The correct view is that he has to accept it.

The second is that which does not form an impermeable \r\nbarrier to water, such as henna dye, and hence does not hurt the wudoo or ghusl.<\/p>\r\n<p>And Allah the most glorified and Almighty knows what is most correct and best.<\/p>\r\n<p>References: <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam Al-Mar&#146;ah, Abdul Karim Zaidan, 1\/84-85. <\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>Fataawi Al-Mar&#146;ah Al-Muslimah, Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih Al-Uthaymeen, 1\/220. <\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>Ahkaam Tajmeel Al-Nisaa&#146; fi Al-Shari&#145;ah Al-Islamiyyah, Izdihar Al-Madani. <\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>Zeenat Al-Mar&#146;ah bayn Al-Tibb wa Al-Shar&#145;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"4253","question_id":"4253","answers":"<p><big><span>Praise be to \r\n          Allaah. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><span>Pork is haraam and \r\n          it is not permissible to eat it, whether it is the meat, fat or any \r\n          other part, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><i><span>&ldquo;<\/span>Forbidden \r\n          to you (for food) are: Al-Maitah (the dead animals &mdash; cattle &mdash; \r\n          beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine<span>[al-Maa&rsquo;idah \r\n          5:3]<\/span><\/i><span>&nbsp; <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big>The Muslims are agreed that all parts of the pig \r\n          are haraam.

Whichever of the two prevails or comes first decides which parent the child will\r\n    resemble.&#148; (Agreed upon. <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, 469).<\/p>\r\n    <p>In his commentary on <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> (3\/222), Imaam\r\n    al-Nawawi said, concerning the words of the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) &#147;The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is\r\n    thin and yellow&#148;: &#147;This is an important criterion in describing <i>maniy<\/i>.\r\n    This description applies when a person is healthy, and in most cases. The scholars said:\r\n    when a man is healthy, his semen is white and thick, and gushes out in spurts accompanied\r\n    by feelings of pleasure. After it has come out, it is followed immediately by a feeling of\r\n    being drained and exhausted. Its smell is like that of palm tree pollen, which in turn\r\n    resembles the smell of dough&#133; (the colour of semen may change for a number of\r\n    reasons, including the following): &#133; If a person is sick his semen may become thin\r\n    and yellow, or his testicles may become slack or soft, with the result that the emission\r\n    of semen is not accompanied by any feelings of pleasure. If a man engages in intercourse\r\n    too frequently, his semen may become red and resemble the juice that comes from meat, or\r\n    may even contain blood [&#145;ameet???]. There are three distinguishing features of semen,\r\n    the presence of any of which is sufficient for it to be classified as semen: firstly, its\r\n    emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion;\r\n    secondly, it smells like palm tree pollen, as stated above; and thirdly, it gushes out in\r\n    spurts. Each one of these three characteristics is sufficient for it to be defined as\r\n    semen; it is not necessary for all three features to be present. If none of them are\r\n    present, the substance cannot be described as semen and in all likelihood it is not. All\r\n    of the above applies to the <i>maniy<\/i> of men; in the case of women, their <i>maniy<\/i>\r\n    is thin and yellow, although it could become white if the woman is strong. It has two\r\n    distinguishing characteristics, either of which is sufficient to class the substance as <i>maniy<\/i>:\r\n    firstly, it smells like the <i>maniy<\/i> of men, and secondly, its emission is accompanied\r\n    by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>Madhiy<\/i>, on the other hand, is a sticky white fluid that is\r\n    emitted when a person is thinking of or desiring intercourse. Its emission is not\r\n    accompanied by feelings of pleasure, it does not gush out in spurts, and it is not\r\n    followed by exhaustion. This may happen to men and women alike, although it is more common\r\n    among women. This is the comment of Imaam al-Nawawi in his commentary on Muslim (<i>Sharh\r\n    Muslim<\/i>, 3\/213).<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>The second difference: what should be done after\r\n    emission of either type of fluid<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <p>When <i>maniy<\/i> is emitted, a person must perform ghusl to clean\r\n    himself from sexual impurity (<i>janaabah<\/i>), whether this happened during intercourse\r\n    or otherwise, whether he was awake or it happened because of an erotic dream. <i>Madhiy<\/i>,\r\n    on the other hand, means that a person only needs to do wudoo&#146;. The evidence for this\r\n    is the report of &#145;Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said:\r\n    &#147;I was a man who used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, so I told Miqdaad to\r\n    ask the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it. So\r\n    he asked him, and he said: &#145;It requires wudoo&#146;.&#146;&#148; (Agreed upon;\r\n    this version was narrated by al-Bukhaari). Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>\r\n    (1\/168), &#147;Ibn al-Mundhir said: &#145;The scholars agree that passing stools or urine,\r\n    the emission of <i>madhiy<\/i> or passing wind are all things that invalidate <i>tahaarah<\/i>\r\n    (purity) [i.e. they mean that wudoo&#146; must be renewed]&#146;.&#148; <\/p>\r\n    <u><p>The third difference: whether they are <i>taahir<\/i> (pure) or <i>naajis<\/i>\r\n    (impure)<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <i><p>Maniy<\/i> is <i>taahir<\/i> according to the most correct opinion\r\n    among the scholars. The evidence for this is the report of &#145;Aa&#146;ishah (may Allaah\r\n    be pleased with her) who said: &#147;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to wash the <i>maniy<\/i> (from his clothes) then go out to pray\r\n    wearing the same clothes, and I could see the spot where he had washed it.&#148; (Agreed\r\n    upon). According to a report narrated by Muslim: &#147;I used to rub it (semen) thoroughly\r\n    from the garment of the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him), then he would pray in it.&#148; According to another version: &#147;I would scratch\r\n    it from his garment with my nail when it had become dry.&#148; It is proven that the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to leave it without washing\r\n    it when it was wet; it was sufficient just to wipe it with <i>&#145;ood<\/i> (a kind of\r\n    aromatic wood) or something similar, as was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his <i>Musnad<\/i>\r\n    (6\/243) from &#145;Aa&#146;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: &#147;The\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to remove <i>maniy<\/i>\r\n    from his garment with a twig of <i>adhkhar<\/i> (a kind of tree), then pray in that\r\n    garment, and he would rub it from his garment once it was dry, and would pray in the same\r\n    garment.&#148; Ibn Khuzaymah reported it in his <i>Saheeh<\/i>, and Shaykh al-Albaani\r\n    classed it as <i>hasan<\/i> in <i>al-Irwa&#146;<\/i> (1\/197).<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>Madhiy<\/i> (urethral discharge) is <i>naajis<\/i> (impure), because\r\n    of the hadeeth of &#145;Ali quoted above, in some versions of which it is reported that\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded him to wash his\r\n    penis and testicles and do wudoo&#146;, as was reported by Abu &#145;Awaanah in <i>al-Mustakhraj<\/i>.\r\n    Ibn Hajar said in <i>al-Talkhees<\/i>: &#147;There is nothing at fault in this <i>isnaad<\/i>.&#148;\r\n    So <i>madhiy<\/i> is <i>naajis<\/i> and the penis and testicles must be washed, as it\r\n    nullifies <i>tahaarah<\/i>.<\/p>\r\n    <u><p>Ruling concerning clothing on which there is semen or urethral\r\n    discharge<\/u><\/p>\r\n    <p>As <i>maniy<\/i> is deemed to be <i>taahir<\/i>, if it gets on a\r\n    person&#146;s clothes it does not make them impure, and if he prays in those clothes there\r\n    is nothing wrong with that. Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (1\/763): &#147;Even\r\n    though we say it is <i>taahir<\/i>, it is better to rub it, but if one prays (in those\r\n    clothes) without rubbing it, this is acceptable.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In the case of <i>madhiy<\/i>, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it,\r\n    because of the difficulty of doing otherwise. The evidence for this is the hadeeth\r\n    narrated by Abu Dawud in his <i>Sunan<\/i> from Sahl ibn Haneef, who said: &#147;I used to\r\n    experience a lot of urethral discharge, and I used to do ghusl a lot. I asked the\r\n    Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it and he said:\r\n    &#145;It is sufficient for you to do wudoo&#146; (to purify yourself) from that.&#146; I\r\n    said, &#145;O Messenger of Allaah, what about when it gets on my clothes?&#146; He said:\r\n    &#145;It is sufficient for you to take a handful of water and sprinkle it on your clothes\r\n    wherever you think (the <i>madhiy<\/i>) is.&#146;&#148; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi.

The same applies to \r\n    the transformation of animals and plants. Indeed, I say: Observation shows \r\n    us that everything that Allah causes to change and transform from one thing \r\n    to another, such as turning wine into vinegar, blood into semen, the &lsquo;alaqah \r\n    (blood clot) into the mudghah (lump of chewed flesh) [this is a reference to \r\n    stages in the development the foetus], the meat of the animal that eats \r\n    filth into meat that is good and pure, and the same applies to its milk or \r\n    eggs, and crops that are irrigated with something impure becoming pure if \r\n    they are irritated with pure water, and so on -- in all of these cases the \r\n    ruling of impurity is no longer applicable and the fact of impurity and the \r\n    name are no longer applicable. This is something clear and indisputable. All \r\n    physical creations on earth may be transformed by Allah from one thing to \r\n    another, and no attention is to be paid to their elements and components.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>Majmoo&lsquo; \r\n    al-Fataawa<\/span><\/i><span>, \r\n    21\/600-601&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>Ibn al-Qayyim \r\n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>When something \r\n    good and pure turns into something bad and impure, it is deemed to be najis, \r\n    such as water and food when they turn into urine and stools. So how come we \r\n    agree on the fact that something pure can be turned into something impure \r\n    and do not agree on the opposite of that? Allah brings forth good and pure \r\n    things from bad and impure things, and bad and impure things from good and \r\n    pure things. The origin does not matter; rather what matters is the \r\n    characteristic of the thing itself. It is not logical for the ruling of \r\n    impurity to remain when the name and characteristic of impurity is no longer \r\n    there. The ruling is connected to the name and characteristic, and changes \r\n    with it, according to whether it is there or not.

Tanning means treating the skin with \r\n      things that clean it and purify it, to remove any smell, decay or \r\n      dampness. This is what usually happens. For the ruling on buying these \r\n      things, it is essential to know the kind of animal from the skin of which \r\n      it has been made; it can only be either an animal that it is permissible \r\n      to eat or an animal that it is not permissible to eat.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (a) <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If those things are made from the skin of an animal that may \r\n    be eaten -- such as a cow -- then tanning makes its skin permissible. If it \r\n    has been slaughtered according to shar&lsquo;i conditions, there is no need for \r\n    tanning. But if it was slaughtered by people who go against the laws of \r\n    Allah, may He be exalted, then it is maytah (dead meat), and the skin of an \r\n    animal that may be eaten but died without being properly slaughtered can \r\n    only become permissible by means of tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    (b)<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If these things are made from the skin of an animal that \r\n    cannot be eaten in the first place, such as a pig, then it is haraam to use \r\n    its skin even if it has been tanned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So with regard to animals whose meat may be eaten, \r\n    slaughtering them in accordance with sharee&lsquo;ah makes their meat and skin \r\n    permissible, and tanning makes their skin permissible if the animal died \r\n    without being slaughtered in accordance with sharee&lsquo;ah (maytah or &ldquo;dead \r\n    meat&rdquo;).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of animals that cannot be eaten, slaughtering \r\n    them in the shar&lsquo;i manner does not make their meat or skins permissible, and \r\n    tanning does not make their skins permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of al-Awza&lsquo;i, &lsquo;Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak, \r\n    Abu Thawr and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh; it is one view narrated from Imam Ahmad; \r\n    and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) according to one of his two opinions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i> by al-Nawawi, 4\/54, where he (may \r\n    Allah have mercy on him) mentioned seven opinions on this matter; <i>\r\n    al-Furoo&lsquo;<\/i> by Ibn Muflih 1\/102; <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> by Ibn Taymiyah \r\n    21\/95.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view was also favoured by a number of contemporary \r\n    scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And it was said that the skin of an animal that died without \r\n    being slaughtered correctly may be purified by means of tanning so long as \r\n    it comes from an animal that may be made permissible by means of proper \r\n    slaughter. But if it cannot be made permissible by means of proper \r\n    slaughter, then it cannot be purified. This view is most likely to be \r\n    correct. Based on that, the skin of a cat and any smaller animal cannot be \r\n    purified by means of tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The ruling is connected to whether the animal is regarded as \r\n    taahir (pure) when it is alive. If it is taahir (pure), then it is \r\n    permissible to use the skin of that animal if it died without being \r\n    slaughtered properly, after tanning it once it has dried. But according to \r\n    the madhhab it cannot be purified. According to the second opinion, it can \r\n    be purified, and according to the third opinion, it becomes pure through \r\n    tanning if it is from a dead animal that would be permissible (to eat) if \r\n    slaughtered properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most correct view is the third one, based on the fact \r\n    that in some versions of the hadeeth it says: &ldquo;Its tanning is its \r\n    purification&rdquo; (narrated by al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 4243; classed as saheeh by al-Haafiz \r\n    ibn Hajar in <i>al-Talkhees al-Habeer<\/i>, 1\/49). So the word purification \r\n    was used, and it is well known that slaughter does not purify anything \r\n    except that which it is permissible to eat. If you slaughtered a donkey and \r\n    mentioned the name of Allah over it and shed its blood, it still could not \r\n    be called halaal slaughter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this we say: the skin of an animal that it is haraam \r\n    to eat, even if it is regarded as taahir when alive, cannot be purified by \r\n    tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason for that is that the animal that is taahir when it \r\n    is alive was regarded as taahir because it is too difficult to avoid them \r\n    completely, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;They are among those who go around among you&rdquo; -- referring to cats. \r\n    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (92), Abu Dawood (75), al-Nasaa&rsquo;i \r\n    (68) and Ibn Maajah (368), and was classed as saheeh by al-Bukhaari, \r\n    al-Tirmidhi, al-Daaraqutni and al-&lsquo;Aqeeli, as stated by Ibn Hajar in <i>\r\n    al-Talkhees al-Habeer<\/i> (1\/41). This reason ceases to apply when the \r\n    animal dies, whereupon it goes back to its original state, which is najaasah \r\n    (impurity), and it cannot be purified by means of tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the correct view is that any animal that dies and may be \r\n    eaten, its skin is purified by tanning. This is one of the two opinions of \r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him); he has another \r\n    opinion which is in accordance with the view of those who say that whatever \r\n    was taahir when it was alive, its skin may be purified by tanning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&lsquo;<\/i>, 1\/74, 75&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is permissible for you to buy a football or basketball \r\n    that is made from the skin of an animal whose meat may be eaten. Whatever \r\n    was slaughtered in a way other than the shar&lsquo;i way or died of natural causes \r\n    without being slaughtered at all, tanning its skin makes it taahir (pure) \r\n    because of the hadeeth of Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allah be pleased with him), \r\n    from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: \r\n    &ldquo;Tanning the skin of the dead animal (that died without being slaughtered) \r\n    is its purification.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (1290) and al-Daaraqutni (25); \r\n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answers to questions no.\r\n    [fatin]9022[\\fatin] and\r\n    [fatin]1695[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4271","question_id":"4271","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      What is required is to do ghusl if water is available and \r\n      one is able to do that, because Allah says (interpretation of the \r\n      meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto \r\n    them as Allaah has ordained for you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:222]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So she has to purify herself with water after her menses or \r\n    after postpartum bleeding stops, then he may come to her.

If there is \r\n    no clear sign that the impurity has become mixed with it, this doubt about \r\n    the water when the water is good and there is no change in it, comes under \r\n    the heading of putting oneself through unnecessary hardship, which Allah has \r\n    stated is not appropriate in our sharee&lsquo;ah, and it is a restriction from \r\n    which Allah has saved yus.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is proven that &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased \r\n    with him) did wudoo&rsquo; using water from a Christian vessel, even though there \r\n    was a possibility that the water could have been mixed with some impurity. \r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) and a companion of his \r\n    passed by a downspout, and his companion said to its owner: O owner of the \r\n    downspout, is your water pure or impure? &lsquo;Umar said: O owner of the \r\n    downspout, do not tell him, because he has no need to know.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam Ahmad and others stated, with regard to this issue, that \r\n    if water falls on a person from a downspout and the like, and there is no \r\n    sign to indicate that it is impure, then he does not have to ask about it; \r\n    rather doing so is makrooh.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 1\/225, 226&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked about a person who does wudoo&rsquo; in a place where \r\n    people relieve themselves and there is the possibility that his garment may \r\n    become impure; does he have to wash his garment?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Before I answer this question, I want to say:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This sharee&lsquo;ah &ndash; praise be to Allah &ndash; is perfect in all \r\n    aspects and is suited to sound human nature that Allah has instilled in man. \r\n    It came to make things easy and in fact it came to save man from confusion \r\n    caused by whispers from the Shaytaan and imaginary matters for which there \r\n    is no foundation. Based on that, the basic principle is that the individual \r\n    and his garments are pure, so long as there is no certainty that any \r\n    impurity has got onto his body or garments. This basic principle is \r\n    supported by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) to a man who complained to him that he imagined that he felt something \r\n    &ndash; namely breaking wind &ndash; when he was praying. The Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;No one should stop (praying) unless he \r\n    hears a sound or notices a smell.&rdquo; So the basic principle is that things \r\n    remain as they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If water gets onto the clothes in which they entered the \r\n    washroom in which they relieved themselves, as the questioner says, who can \r\n    tell whether this dampness comes from impurity such as urine or water that \r\n    has changed because of contact with faeces and the like? If we are not \r\n    certain that that is the case, then the basic principle is that things are \r\n    pure. Granted, he may think it most likely that it has been contaminated \r\n    with something impure, but so long as we are not certain, the basic \r\n    principle is that things remain pure.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So in answer to this question, we say: if they are not \r\n    certain that something impure has got onto their clothes, then the basic \r\n    principle is that they remain pure and they do not have to wash their \r\n    clothes; they can pray in them and there is nothing wrong with that.

So \r\n    it is as if the verse is basically saying: &ldquo;Wash your faces, your arms up to \r\n    the elbows and your feet up to the ankles, and wipe your heads,&rdquo; but mention \r\n    of washing the feet is put after mention of wiping the head so as to \r\n    indicate that this is the order in which the parts of the body are washed in \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;: washing the face, then the arms, then wiping the head, then washing \r\n    the feet.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 1\/471&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Wa arjulikum, with a kasrah on the laam.

For the one whose feet are bare, it is better \r\n    for him to wash them, and he should not put on socks so that he can wipe \r\n    over them, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) used to wash his feet when they were bare, and he would wipe over them \r\n    if he was wearing khufoof.

So the condition is that \r\n          wiping the socks may be done when purifying oneself (doing wudoo&rsquo;) from \r\n          minor impurity, and it is not permissible in the case of major impurity, \r\n          because of the hadeeth which we have mentioned here.&nbsp; <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big><span>The fourth condition: <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><span>That the wiping may be done within the \r\n          time specified by sharee&rsquo;ah, which is one day and one night in the case \r\n          of one who is not travelling, and three days and three nights in the \r\n          case of one who is travelling. This is because of the hadeeth of &lsquo;Ali \r\n          ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: &ldquo;The Prophet \r\n          <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n          be upon him) stated one day and one night for the one who is not travelling, \r\n          and three days and three nights for the one who is travelling, i.e., \r\n          for wiping over the <i>khufoof<\/i>.&rdquo; This was narrated by Muslim. This \r\n          period starts from the first time one wipes over the socks when doing \r\n          wudoo&rsquo; after some minor impurity, and it ends twenty-four later for \r\n          the one who is not travelling, and seventy-two hours later for the one \r\n          who is travelling. So if we assume that a person purifies himself for \r\n          Fajr prayer on Tuesday and remains <i>taahir<\/i> (pure, i.e., keeps \r\n          his wudoo&rsquo;) until &lsquo;Isha prayer on Tuesday evening, then he sleeps and \r\n          wakes up to pray Fajr on Wednesday, and he wipes his socks at five o&rsquo;clock \r\n          zawaali time , then the period begins from 5 a.m. on Wednesday and lasts \r\n          until 5 a.m. on Thursday. If we assume that he wiped his socks before \r\n          5 a.m then he can pray Fajr on Thursday with this wiping and pray as \r\n          much as he wants as long as he remains taahir, because according to \r\n          the most correct scholarly opinion, wudoo&rsquo; is not broken when the time \r\n          period for wiping over the socks expires. That is because the Messenger \r\n          of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n          of Allaah be upon him) did not set a time limit for <i>tahaarah<\/i>, \r\n          rather he set a time limit for wiping over the socks. Once that time \r\n          limit expires, one cannot wipe over the socks again, but if a person \r\n          remains in a state of <i>tahaarah<\/i> then his <i>tahaarah<\/i> is still \r\n          valid, because this is what is implied by the shar&rsquo;i evidence, and whatever \r\n          is proven by shar&rsquo;i evidence cannot be invalidated unless there is further \r\n          shar&rsquo;i evidence to that effect. There is no evidence to suggest that \r\n          wudoo&rsquo; is broken when the time limit for wiping over the socks expires, \r\n          because what the basic principle is that he remains as he is (i.e., \r\n          taahir) until it becomes apparent that this is no longer the case. &nbsp; \r\n          <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><big><\/big><span>These are the conditions which apply to wiping over the khufoof.

Hence some \r\n    of their companions differed from them as we shall see below. I do not know \r\n    of any precedent for them among the Sahaabah, unlike the second view, for \r\n    which there is the saheeh ahaadeeth and the fatwa of &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the Sunnah, there are the saheeh ahaadeeth which were \r\n    narrated from a number of the Sahaabah in <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i>, the four <i>\r\n    Sunans<\/i>, the <i>Musnads<\/i> and elsewhere, among which is the report that \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined wiping \r\n    (over the socks or khufoof). In some reports it says that he granted a \r\n    concession allowing wiping (over the socks or khufoof). In others it says \r\n    that he made (the time period) for wiping for the non-traveller one day and \r\n    one night, and for the traveller three days and three nights. It is very \r\n    clear that the hadeeth is referring to the start of the period for wiping \r\n    over the khufoof or socks, which begins when one wipes over them (for the \r\n    first time?), and that is a refutation of the first views, because what it \r\n    implies, as they stated in <i>al-Furoo&rsquo;<\/i> is that the one who prays Fajr \r\n    just before the sun rises, then breaks his wudoo&rsquo; at dawn on the next day \r\n    then does wudoo&rsquo; and wipes over his socks or khufoof for the first time to \r\n    pray Fajr, may not do so after that, so can it be said of a person in such a \r\n    case that he has wiped over them for one night and one day? But according to \r\n    the second view, which is more correct, he may wipe over them until just \r\n    before dawn on the third day. Indeed, they said something stranger than what \r\n    we have mentioned, which is that if he breaks his wudoo&rsquo; and does not wipe \r\n    (over his sock etc.) until one day and one night have passed, or three days \r\n    if he is a traveller, then the time for wiping has ended and it is not \r\n    permissible to wipe over the khufoof or socks after that, until he puts them \r\n    on again after doing wudoo&rsquo;. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So they deprived him of benefitting from this concession, \r\n    based on this opinion that is contrary to the Sunnah. Hence Imam al-Nawawi \r\n    did not could not but adopt a view contrary to that of his madhhab because \r\n    of the strength of the evidence. After mentioning the first opinion and \r\n    those who followed it, he said (1\/487):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and Abu Thawr said: The period begins from when he \r\n    first wipes over them after breaking his wudoo&rsquo;. This was narrated from \r\n    Ahmad and Dawood, and it is the more correct view based on the evidence. It \r\n    was also favoured by Ibn al-Mundhir, and a similar view was narrated from \r\n    &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him). Al-Mawardi and \r\n    al-Shaashi narrated from al-Hasan al-Basri that it begins from the time one \r\n    puts on (the socks or khufoof), and those who say it starts from when one \r\n    wipes for the first time quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), &ldquo;The traveller may wipe [over \r\n    the khufoof or socks] for three days.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These are saheeh ahaadeeth, as stated above. This clearly \r\n    states that one may wipe over them for three days, and that can only apply \r\n    if the period starts from the first time one wipes over them, because \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: If a person breaks his \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; when not travelling and wipes over [the socks or khufoof] when \r\n    travelling, then he may complete the period that is allowed for the \r\n    traveller. So he connected the ruling to wiping (i.e., the first time it is \r\n    done). Our companions quoted as evidence the report narrated by al-Haafiz \r\n    al-Qaasim ibn Zakariya al-Matrazi concerning a hadeeth narrated by Safwaan: \r\n    &ldquo;from one breaking of one&rsquo;s wudoo&rsquo; to another&rdquo;, which is a strange addition \r\n    that is not proven, and by analogy&hellip; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I [al-Albaani] say: The analogy referred to, even if it was a \r\n    sound analogy in and of itself, the condition for accepting it and using it \r\n    as evidence is that it should not contradict the Sunnah. But because it does \r\n    contradict the Sunnah, as you can see, then it is not permissible to pay any \r\n    attention to it. Hence it was said: When there is a report, there is no room \r\n    for personal opinion. So how about if it is also contrary to the words of \r\n    the Rightly-Guided Caliph &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab? I know that some of those \r\n    who follow unthinkingly ignore the Sunnah when it differs from a report \r\n    narrated from &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), as they did with \r\n    regard to the threefold divorce, so how can they not follow his opinion when \r\n    it is in accordance with the Sunnah? &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq narrated in <i>\r\n    al-Musannaf<\/i> (1\/209, 807) that Abu &lsquo;Uthmaan al-Nahdi said: I saw Sa&rsquo;d and \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Amr refer a dispute to &lsquo;Umar about wiping over the khuffayn. &lsquo;Umar \r\n    said: He may wipe over them from the time he (first) wipes over them for a \r\n    day and a night. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I say: Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of \r\n    the two Shaykhs, and it clearly shows that (the period for) wiping over the \r\n    khuffayn starts when from the first time one wipes over them until the same \r\n    time the next day or night. This is the apparent meaning of all the reports \r\n    which have been narrated from the Sahaabah concerning the period for wiping \r\n    over the khuffayn, as far as we know, which was narrated by &lsquo;Abd al-Razzaaq \r\n    and Ibn Abi Shaybah in <i>al-Musannaf<\/i>. For example, I may quote what was \r\n    narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (1\/180) from &lsquo;Amr ibn al-Haarith who said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    I went out with &lsquo;Abd-Allaah to al-Madaa&rsquo;in and he wiped over \r\n    his khuffayn for three days and did not take them off.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From the words &ldquo;however one wipes them it is acceptable&rdquo; it \r\n    may be understood that what you mention about wiping the right foot first \r\n    and then the left does not matter; rather it is only different from what is \r\n    preferable if one is able to do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &hellip; \r\n    i.e., what should be wiped is the top of the khuff, so he should pass his \r\n    hand from the toes up to the shin only, and the wiping should be done with \r\n    both hands on both feet at the same time, i.e., the right hand should wipe \r\n    the right foot and the left hand should wipe the left foot at the same time, \r\n    as the ears are wiped, because this is the apparent meaning of the Sunnah. \r\n    Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu&lsquo;bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Then he wiped \r\n    over them, and he did not say that he started with the right foot, rather he \r\n    said that he wiped over them. So this is the apparent meaning of the Sunnah. \r\n    Yes, if we assume that if he cannot use one of his hands, then he should \r\n    start with the right foot before the left foot. But many people wipe with \r\n    both hands on the right foot and both hands on the left foot; there is no \r\n    basis for this as far as I know. &hellip; But however one wipes the top of the \r\n    khuff is acceptable, but what we are talking about here is what is \r\n    preferable.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Mar&rsquo;ah al-Muslimah<\/i>, 1\/250&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It does not matter either if one wipes the right foot with \r\n    the left hand, but the Sunnah is to wipe the right foot with the right hand \r\n    and the left foot with the left hand, unless there is something wrong with \r\n    one of the hands that means it cannot be used.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa&lsquo;<\/i> (1\/119): It is Sunnah \r\n    to wipe the right foot with the right hand and the left foot with the left \r\n    hand, because of the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah quoted above.

This is a strong view, as you can see, \r\n\tand it is supported by the fact that our companions (may Allah have mercy on \r\n\tthem) stated that wiping over the khufoof removes impurity. So he put on the \r\n\tsecond pair when in a state of complete purity, so why shouldn&#8217;t he wipe \r\n\tover them?

It is best to make it an odd number, so if it becomes \r\n    clean after four wipes, it is prescribed to do a fifth, and if it becomes \r\n    clean after six, it is prescribed to do a seventh, because of the general \r\n    meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon \r\n    him): &ldquo;Whoever cleans himself, let him make it an odd number.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i>, \r\n    vol. 2, 4\/36&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if what you mean by istijmaar is washing the traces of \r\n    impurity with water, no number is stipulated in this case, and what is \r\n    required is to wash off the impurity until you think that it has most likely \r\n    been removed. In this case it is sufficient to act upon what you think is \r\n    most likely, and it is not stipulated that you should be certain that it has \r\n    been removed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You should note that this exaggeration comes from the waswaas \r\n    or whispers of the Shaytaan, who intends thereby to make worship difficult \r\n    for the Muslim so that he will give it up or his life difficult and make him \r\n    fall into distress and grief.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You have to limit yourself to that which is mentioned in \r\n    sharee&rsquo;ah without adding or taking away anything. If the shaytaan whispers \r\n    to you that you have not purified yourself, do not pay any attention to this \r\n    whisper, until Allaah takes it away from you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: For a \r\n    believer must be an enemy of the shaytaan, fighting him and resisting him, \r\n    and not giving in to him. If he tells you that you did not do wudoo&rsquo; and did \r\n    not pray, when you know that you did do wudoo' and pray, and you can see \r\n    water on your hand and you know that you prayed, then do not pay any heed to \r\n    the enemy of Allaah, and affirm to yourself that you have prayed and be \r\n    certain that you have done wudoo&rsquo;, and do not repeat any of that. Seek \r\n    refuge with Allaah from the enemy of Allaah, the Shaytaan. Thus the believer \r\n    must be strong in fighting the enemy of Allaah and resisting him so that he \r\n    will not gain any power over him or harm him, because if he gains power over \r\n    a person he will make him like one who is insane and will toy with him. So \r\n    what the believer, man or woman, must do is beware of the enemy of Allaah, \r\n    seek refuge with Allaah from his evil and his tricks, and be strong and \r\n    patient in doing so, so that he will not obey him by repeating the prayer or \r\n    by repeating wudoo' or by repeating the takbeer and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, if he says to you: Your garment is impure, or this \r\n    spot is impure, or there is some impurity in the bathroom, or there is some \r\n    impurity on the ground that you walked on, or there is such and such in the \r\n    place where you pray, then do not obey him in that. The enemy of Allaah is \r\n    lying. Seek refuge with Allaah from his evil and pray in the place where you \r\n    usually pray and on the mat on which you usually pray and on the ground that \r\n    you walk on, and know that it is clean and pure, unless you see with your \r\n    own eye some impurity that you stepped on when it was still wet, in which \r\n    case wash your foot. And praise be to Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to his whispers, do not pay any heed to the enemy \r\n    of Allaah. Remember that the basic principle is that things are pure. This \r\n    is the basic principle, so do not pay any heed to the enemy of Allaah unless \r\n    you are certain that you have seen it with your own eyes, so that the enemy \r\n    of Allaah will not gain any power over you.

If a person only washes his arms from the wrist to the \r\n    elbow, then he has not completed wudoo&rsquo; as required, and he has to repeat \r\n    his wudoo&rsquo; after completing it, or he has to wash what he omitted if only a \r\n    short time has passed (since he completed it), so he should wash the hands \r\n    and what comes after that.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>al-Lu&rsquo;lu&rsquo; al-Makeen min Fataawa Shaykh Ibn \r\n    Jibreen<\/i>, p. 77&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    Here we should point out something that many people neglect, as they wash \r\n    the arm from the wrist to the elbow, thinking that they had finished washing \r\n    the hands before washing the face, but this is not correct.

[fatin]103694[\\fatin] we stated that \r\n    what is required is to wash the arms from the tips of the fingers to the \r\n    elbows, and that if they ware washed from the wrists then wudoo&rsquo; is not \r\n    valid. This is the view of the majority of scholars, except the Hanafis who \r\n    say that the wudoo&rsquo; of one who does that is still valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is valid to pray behind \r\n    a Hanafi who only washed the hands at first and did not wash them again with \r\n    the forearms, because it is an issue concerning which the scholars differed, \r\n    and the ordinary Muslim is excused for following whichever scholar he \r\n    follows.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is valid to pray behind \r\n    one whose situation you do not know, and you do not know whether he washed \r\n    his hands in the correct manner or not. It is not appropriate to doubt the \r\n    worship of a Muslim, rather you should assume that he is doing it \r\n    correctly..&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>You should explain this \r\n    issue to your brothers with wisdom and beautiful preaching, but if they \r\n    insist on the view and cling to the Hanafi madhhab or the view of the one \r\n    who issued a fatwa to them, then do not argue with them, and do not feel any \r\n    reservations about praying behind them. The imams continued to pray behind \r\n    one another even though they differed concerning minor issues. Hence they \r\n    regarded it as valid to pray behind one who thought that wudoo&rsquo; was \r\n    invalidated by eating camel meat or touching the penis and other matters \r\n    concerning which the scholars differed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i> (2\/11): As for those who differ concerning minor issues such \r\n    as the companions of Abu Haneefah, Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, praying behind \r\n    them is valid and is not makrooh. This was stated by Ahmad. That is because \r\n    the Sahaabah and Taabi&rsquo;een and those who came after them continued to lead \r\n    one another in prayer, even though they differed concerning minor issues, so \r\n    their action is equivalent to scholarly consensus. And because the one who \r\n    held a different view is either correct in his ijtihaad, so he will have two \r\n    rewards, one for his ijtihaad and one for getting it right, or he is \r\n    mistaken, so he will be rewarded for his ijtihaad and there is no sin on him \r\n    for his mistake, because it is forgiven (as stated in the hadeeth). If he \r\n    knows that he has omitted an obligatory part or condition that the person \r\n    praying behind him believes in but the imam does not, then according to the \r\n    apparent meaning of Ahmad&rsquo;s words it is valid for him to lead him in prayer. \r\n    Al-Athram said: I heard Abu &lsquo;Abd-Allaah when he was asked about a man who \r\n    led some people in prayer, and he was wearing a fox-skin. He said: If he is \r\n    wearing it on the basis of his understanding of the hadeeth, &ldquo;Any skin that \r\n    had been tanned is purified,&rdquo; then he may pray behind him. It was said to \r\n    him: Do you think that it is permissible? He said: No, we do not think that \r\n    it is permissible, but if he thinks that then there is nothing wrong with \r\n    praying behind him.

These ahaadeeth do not \r\n    refer to any such thing. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This opinion is the weakest of the scholarly views on this \r\n    matter. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, as \r\n    is mentioned in <i>al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i> (p. 18): If he touches a woman \r\n    without desire, then it is well known that the Lawgiver does not require him \r\n    to do wudoo&rsquo; and it is not mustahabb for him to do wudoo&rsquo;.

This is the view \r\n    of Imam Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view is indicated by a number of things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>The basic principle is that \r\n    purity (tahaarah) remains valid and is not cancelled out unless there is \r\n    sound evidence that this thing invalidates wudoo&rsquo;, and there is no such \r\n    evidence in this case. As for the verse, we shall see below that what it \r\n    refers to is intercourse, not just touching.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It was narrated that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I used to sleep in front of the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and my \r\n    legs would be in the direction of his qiblah.

His tafseer takes precedence over the \r\n    tafseer of others, because of the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prayed for him and said: &ldquo;O Allaah, \r\n    grant him understanding of the deen and teach him understanding (of the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan).&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad; it is also narrated in al-Bukhaari.

This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars of the \r\n    earlier and later generations. &hellip; Our companions said: With regard to doubt \r\n    it makes no difference whether the two possibilities with regard to \r\n    invalidation of purity are equal or not, or if one of them is more likely, \r\n    or he thinks it most likely. He does not have to do wudoo&rsquo; in any case. End \r\n    quote from <i>Sharh Muslim<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: When I urinate and do wudoo&rsquo; then pray, I feel that something is \r\n    coming out of my penis, and when I check it I find that some urine has come \r\n    out. What is the solution?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: Undoubtedly in His wisdom Allaah has made strong \r\n    nerves that control urine and faeces so that nothing comes out. But these \r\n    nerves may be affected by sickness so that they become weak, then urine \r\n    comes out either continuously or occasionally. A person may himself be the \r\n    cause of that, because there are some people who, when they finish \r\n    urinating, squeeze the urethra to the end of the penis, so as to extract the \r\n    urine, and there are some who keep squeezing until the last drop of urine \r\n    comes out. This is a mistake, even though some fuqaha&rsquo; say that it is Sunnah \r\n    to extract the last drop. This is a weak view, and in fact is bid&rsquo;ah \r\n    (innovation), as was stated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) and as is obvious from the Sunnah, because there no report \r\n    that the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) squeezed \r\n    the urethra to the end of the penis, or that he squeezed it to extract the \r\n    urine. But some people do that, either because they are following the \r\n    opinion of the fuqaha&rsquo; who said that, or because they imagine that if they \r\n    do not do that, there will be some urine left in the penis. But this is a \r\n    mistake. If a person urinates and washes the tip of the penis only, that is \r\n    sufficient and there is no need to squeeze it or shake it. Rather he should \r\n    wash the tip of the penis where the urine has got onto it, and that is the \r\n    end of the matter, even if the person has gotten used to doing this because \r\n    of this sickness of which he himself is the cause. My advice to him is: if \r\n    this happens to you, do not pay any attention to it, do not squeeze the \r\n    penis, rather leave it as it is. When the last drop of urine has come out, \r\n    he should wash the tip of the penis, and he may feel something in his penis \r\n    but he does not have to look, because some people, when they feel something \r\n    in the penis, they pull down their trousers and start squeezing the penis \r\n    from the end. But if he squeezes it something will inevitably come out. \r\n    Rather he should leave it and not pay any attention to it. Some of the \r\n    scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) said: In this case if he is \r\n    affected by this waswaas, he should sprinkle some water on his trousers so \r\n    that if he thinks or doubts he can assume it is this water. But we say: \r\n    there is no need for that, and this is too much. Do not do that, and do not \r\n    pay any attention to it, and it will go away in sha Allaah. If you feel some \r\n    coolness at the tip of the penis or you feel something in the penis, do not \r\n    go and look. Forget about it.

Then she did tawaaf and \r\n    when she finished tawaaf she went off by herself and did wudoo&rsquo;, then she \r\n    did saa&rsquo;i.

So she \r\n    should go back to Makkah and circumambulate the House. It is also mustahabb \r\n    (recommended) for her to repeat saa&rsquo;i, because most of the scholars are of \r\n    the view that it is not permissible to do saa&rsquo;i before tawaaf. Then she \r\n    should cut some hair from all parts of her head and exit ihraam. If she has \r\n    a husband who had intercourse with her, then he has to slaughter a sheep in \r\n    Makkah to be distributed to the poor, and she has to do another &lsquo;Umrah from \r\n    the meeqaat from which she entered ihraam for the first &lsquo;umrah, because the \r\n    first &lsquo;umrah was invalidated by that intercourse. She should do what we have \r\n    mentioned, then do another &lsquo;Umrah from the meeqaat from which she entered \r\n    ihraam for the first &lsquo;umrah, whether she does that now or at another time, \r\n    depending on her ability. And Allaah is the source of strength.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz<\/i>, \r\n    17\/214-215&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He was also asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A man started to do \r\n    tawaaf, then he passed wind.

He should go and purify himself, then start tawaaf again. This is \r\n    the correct view; there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning this \r\n    matter, but this is the correct view concerning both prayer and tawaaf, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;If one of you breaks wind silently during prayer, let him go and do wudoo&rsquo; \r\n    then repeat the prayer.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by Ibn \r\n    Khuzaymah.

This is the view of Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and \r\n    was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. They responded to the \r\n    evidence quoted in support of the first view in the following manner:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the hadeeth: &ldquo;Tawaaf around the House is (a \r\n    kind of) prayer&rdquo;, they said that this is not a saheeh report from the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather these are \r\n    the words of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). Al-Nawawi said in\r\n    <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>: The correct view is that this is a mawqoof report which \r\n    stops at Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas. This was mentioned by al-Bayhaqi and other scholars of \r\n    hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the actions of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his doing tawaaf in a state of tahaarah \r\n    (purity), they said: This does not indicate that it is obligatory, rather it \r\n    only indicates that it is mustahabb (recommended), because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that, but it is not reported \r\n    that he commanded his companions to do that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) saying to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah: &ldquo;Do what the pilgrims do, but do \r\n    not circumambulate the House until you are pure [i.e., until your period \r\n    ends],&rdquo; the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \r\n    her not to do tawaaf because she was menstruating, and the menstruating \r\n    women is forbidden to enter the mosque.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Those who say that it is obligatory to have wudoo&rsquo; in order \r\n    to do tawaaf have no proof at all, because no one narrated, with either a \r\n    saheeh isnaad or a da&rsquo;eef one, that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) enjoined having wudoo&rsquo; in order to do tawaaf. It should \r\n    be noted that very many people did Hajj with him, and he did &lsquo;Umrah numerous \r\n    times and the people did &lsquo;Umrah with him. If wudoo&rsquo; were obligatory for \r\n    tawaaf, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would \r\n    have pointed that out to everyone, and if he had stated that, then the \r\n    Muslims would have transmitted it from him and would not have been negligent \r\n    concerning that.&nbsp; But it is proven in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> that when he did \r\n    tawaaf he did wudoo&rsquo;. This on its own does not indicate that it is \r\n    obligatory, for he used to do wudoo&rsquo; for each prayer and he said: &ldquo;I do not \r\n    like to remember Allaah except in a state of purity.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 21\/273.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Even though this view &ndash;that tahaarah is not an essential \r\n    condition for tawaaf &ndash; has some strength and the evidence may be interpreted \r\n    in this manner, people should not start tawaaf without being in a state of \r\n    purity, because it is undoubtedly better to do tawaaf in a state of purity; \r\n    that is more on the safe side and by doing that one will avoid going against \r\n    the view of the majority of scholars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But a person may do that if it is too difficult to keep or \r\n    repeat one's wudoo&rsquo;, such as during the days of Hajj, or if a person is sick \r\n    or elderly and it is hard to keep his wudoo&rsquo; as well as deal with the crowds \r\n    and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, \r\n    after responding to the evidence quoted by the majority:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, the more correct view which gives peace of \r\n    mind is that it is not essential to be pure from minor impurity (i.e., have \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;) in order to do tawaaf, but it is undoubtedly better and is following \r\n    the example of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \r\n    and no one should neglect purity and go against the majority of scholars in \r\n    this matter. But sometimes one is compelled to follow the view of Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, such as if a person breaks his wudoo&rsquo; when there is \r\n    too much crowding, in which case the view that he has to go and do wudoo&rsquo; \r\n    and come back in this severe crowding, especially when he only has a few \r\n    circuits left, will cause too much hardship. With regard to matters which \r\n    cause too much hardship and regarding which there is no clear text, we \r\n    should not force people to adhere to them, rather we should follow that \r\n    which is more lenient, because forcing people do things that are too hard \r\n    with no clear proof contradicts what Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make \r\n    things difficult for you&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Baqarah 2:185]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/300&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to saa&rsquo;i, it \r\n    is not essential to have wudoo&rsquo; for saa&rsquo;i. This is the view of the four \r\n    Imams, Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad. Indeed it is permissible \r\n    for menstruating women to perform saa&rsquo;i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only \r\n    told menstruating women not to do tawaaf, as he said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with her), when her menses came: &ldquo;Do what the pilgrims do, \r\n    but do not circumambulate the House.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 5\/246&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person does saa&rsquo;i when he does not have wudoo&rsquo;, or when he is junub [in a state of impurity following sexual activity], or if a woman does saa&rsquo;i when she is menstruating, then this is valid, but it is better to do saa&rsquo;i in a state of tahaarah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 7\/310, 311&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4360","question_id":"4360","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Muslims are \r\n    unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to wipe the head when doing wudoo&rsquo;, \r\n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;<span>O you who believe! \r\n    When you intend to offer As-Salaah (the prayer), wash your faces and your \r\n    hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your \r\n    heads, and (wash) your feet up to the<\/span> ankles&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Maa'idah 5:6]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo; are agreed that it is best to wipe the entire \r\n    head, but they differed as to whether doing so is obligatory or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maalikis and Hanbalis are of the view that it is \r\n    obligatory to wipe the entire head.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Hanafis and Shaafa&rsquo;is are of the view that it is \r\n    sufficient to wipe part of the head.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Maalikis and Hanbalis quoted a number of things as \r\n    evidence:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Allaah says &ldquo;<i><span>rub \r\n    (by passing wet hands over) your heads<\/span><\/i>&rdquo; which includes the entire \r\n    head.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;This verse &ndash; &ldquo;<i><span>rub (by \r\n    passing wet hands over) your heads<\/span><\/i>&rdquo; &ndash; refers to the entire head \r\n    and it is like the phrase in which Allaah says concerning tayammum: &ldquo;<i><span>then \r\n    perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands<\/span><\/i>&rdquo; \r\n    [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:6].

Comparing wudoo&#8217; with prayer in this prohibition is comparing \r\n          two things which are not alike, and this is incorrect. If a person speaks \r\n          whilst making wudoo&#8217;, this does not make his wudoo&#8217; invalid, whereas \r\n          speaking invalidates one&#8217;s prayer.

If a person is praying Fajr, \r\n          for example, and he makes the first rak&#8217;ah long, then he starts the \r\n          second rak&#8217;ah and makes it long, and the sun rises (during the second \r\n          rak&#8217;ah), in this case his action is OK, and he has performed the prayer \r\n          at the right time. But if the sun rises when he has not completed the \r\n          first rak&#8217;ah, then he has not prayed at the right time and he has sinned \r\n          by making the rak&#8217;ah too long.

The Prophet (sa) wiped over his hair when it was held \r\n    together with a sticky substance (mulabbad), and he wiped over his turban.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But in the case of ghusl, it must be removed so that the \r\n    water can reach all of the skin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars differed with regard to whether it is \r\n    permissible for a woman to wipe over her head cover.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of them said that it is not acceptable because Allah \r\n    enjoined wiping the head when He said (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;<span>rub \r\n    (by passing wet hands over) your heads<\/span>&rdquo; [al-Maa&rsquo;idah 5:6]<\/i>; and if \r\n    she wipes over her head cover, she has not wiped over her head, rather she \r\n    has wiped over a barrier, namely the head cover, so it is not permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Others said that it is permissible, and they drew an analogy \r\n    between the head cover and the man&rsquo;s turban: the head cover for women is \r\n    like the turban for men, and difficulty is present in both cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Whatever the case, if there is any difficulty because of cold \r\n    weather, or in taking it off and wrapping it again, then there is nothing \r\n    wrong with wiping over it in that case, although it is better not to wipe \r\n    over it, and there is no saheeh hadeeth in this regard.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the hair is stuck together with henna or dye or honey and \r\n    the like, it is permissible to wipe over it, because it is proven that the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to stick his hair \r\n    together with something when he entered ihram, and whatever is applied to \r\n    the hair in this fashion is regarded as being part of the head.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This indicates that there is some element of leniency with \r\n    regard to purifying the head.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, if a woman has stuck her hair together with \r\n    henna, it is permissible for her to wipe over it, and there is no need for \r\n    her to undo her hair and scrape away this henna.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It may be said that there is a precedent, namely the ring; \r\n    the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to wear a \r\n    ring, but despite that he did not make the water go between the ring and the \r\n    skin. Such matters may be overlooked in sharee&lsquo;ah, especially since the \r\n    basic principle concerning the head is that it does not have to be purified \r\n    by washing; rather it is purified by wiping. Hence its purification is \r\n    reduced to wiping.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The turban, khuff (leather slipper) and head cover may only \r\n    be wiped in the case of minor impurity, not major impurity. The evidence for \r\n    that is the hadeeth of Safwaan ibn &lsquo;Assaal who said: The Messenger of Allah \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us when we were \r\n    travelling not to take off our khufoof (leather slippers) for three days and \r\n    nights, except in the case of janaabah, but not in the case of defecation, \r\n    urination or sleep.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words &ldquo;except in the case of janaabah&rdquo; refer to major \r\n    impurity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words &ldquo;but not in the case of defecation, urination or \r\n    sleep&rdquo; refer to minor impurity. If a person becomes junub during the period \r\n    when wiping over the khufoof is permitted, then he should not wipe over \r\n    them; rather he has to do ghusl, because in the case of major impurity, \r\n    there is nothing that can be wiped over at all, except a plaster cast.

This is \r\n    an explanation of the command mentioned in the Qur&rsquo;aan to wash the face when \r\n    purifying oneself.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So if a person omits rinsing the mouth and nose when \r\n    purifying himself, his purification is not valid, whether he did that \r\n    deliberately or by mistake.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person forgets to wash any of the parts of the body that \r\n    should be washed when doing wudoo&rsquo;, or he omits any portion of that, even if \r\n    it is small, if it was during wudoo&rsquo; or immediately afterwards and the \r\n    traces of water are still on his limbs and have not dried yet, then he \r\n    should wash the part that he forgot and those that come after it only.

Hence when &lsquo;Umar \r\n    and &lsquo;Ammaar became junub and &lsquo;Umar did not pray and &lsquo;Ammaar prayed after \r\n    rolling in the dust, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    did not tell either of them to repeat the prayer. Similarly he did not tell \r\n    Abu Dharr to repeat the prayers when he was junub and did not pray for \r\n    several days.

One view is that \r\n    she does not have to make up the prayers &ndash; as was narrated from Maalik and \r\n    others &ndash; because when the woman who was suffering from istihaadah said to \r\n    the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;I have been \r\n    bleeding heavily for some time and it prevents me from praying and fasting,&rdquo; \r\n    he told her what she should do in the future, and he did not tell her to \r\n    make up the prayers of the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;End quote from <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 21\/101&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no.\r\n    [fatin]45648[\\fatin]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But you should do a lot of naafil prayers, because the naafil \r\n    prayers will make up for any shortfall in the obligatory prayers.

What they have said about ghusl meaning to \r\n    pass the hand over something is not sound, because the word <i>ghasala<\/i> \r\n    is used in Arabic to refer to washing a vessel, even if one does not wipe it \r\n    with the hand.&nbsp; And the reason why in tayammum we are commanded to wipe with \r\n    the hand is because it is purification using dust and it is not possible to \r\n    make the dust reach the skin without passing the hand over it.

This is the \r\n    view on which the answer to your question is based, which is the command to \r\n    the one who omits a single prayer with no excuse until the time for it is \r\n    over to do ghusl. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>That is because it is \r\n    prescribed for a kaafir who becomes Muslim to do ghusl, as it is also \r\n    prescribed for an apostate who returns to Islam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said \r\n    in <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> (1\/202):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a kaafir becomes Muslim, \r\n    he has to do ghusl whether he is new to Islam or had apostatized.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;New to Islam&rdquo; means one \r\n    who formerly belonged to another religion all his life, such as a Jew or \r\n    Christian or Buddhist, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Had apostatized&rdquo; means \r\n    that he had been a Muslim, then he apostatized from Islam &ndash; we ask Allaah to \r\n    keep us safe and sound from that &ndash; such as one who did not pray, or thought \r\n    that Allaah has a rival or partner, or prayed to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) seeking his help at a time of hardship, or \r\n    prayed to someone else seeking his help in a matter in which he could not \r\n    help.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The evidence that ghusl is \r\n    required in such cases is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>1 &ndash; The hadeeth of Qays ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Aasim, who said that when he become Muslim the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered him to do ghusl using water and \r\n    lotus leaves. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 605; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \r\n    in <i>Saheeh al-Tirmidhi<\/i>. So the basic principle with regard to this \r\n    matter is that it is obligatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>2 &ndash; He has cleansed himself \r\n    inwardly from the filth of shirk, so wisdom dictates that he should cleanse \r\n    himself outwardly by doing ghusl.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Some of the scholars said \r\n    that he does not have to do ghusl, and they quoted as evidence the fact that \r\n    no general command was narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him), such as saying whoever becomes Muslim let him do \r\n    ghusl, as he said, &ldquo;Whoever comes to Jumu&rsquo;ah, let him do ghusl.&rdquo; How many of \r\n    the Sahaabah become Muslim but there is no report that he told them to do \r\n    ghusl or said, whoever becomes Muslim let him do ghusl. If it were \r\n    obligatory it would have been well known because the people need to know \r\n    about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>We could say that the first \r\n    view, that ghusl is required, is stronger, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued a rule to one member of the \r\n    ummah for which there is no reason to assume that it applied only to him, so \r\n    it may be assumed that it applies to the ummah as a whole. The fact that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued the command \r\n    to one person does not imply that he did not issue the same command to \r\n    others as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to the fact \r\n    that it is not narrated from each one of the Sahaabah that he did ghusl when \r\n    he become Muslim, the fact that there are no reports does not mean that it \r\n    did not happen, because the basic principle is to do that which the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded, and it is not \r\n    essential for there to be a report from each person who did it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>\r\n    al-Mughni<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a kaafir becomes Muslim \r\n    he has to do ghusl, whether he is new to Islam or had apostatized&hellip; this is \r\n    the view of Maalik, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It says in <i>al-Mawso&rsquo;oah \r\n    al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i> (31\/206):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Maalikis and Hanbalis \r\n    are of the view that a kaafir&rsquo;s becoming Muslim necessitates ghusl.

But the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    did not tell them to make up the prayers that they had missed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, if a person did not purify himself as \r\n    prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah because the text had not reached him, such as if he \r\n    ate camel meat and did not do wudoo&rsquo;, then the text reached him and he came \r\n    to know that it is obligatory to do wudoo&rsquo; after eating camel meat, or if he \r\n    prayed in a camel pen then the text reached him (which says that it is not \r\n    allowed to pray in camel pens), does he have to repeat the past prayers? \r\n    There are two opinions, both of which were narrated from Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A similar case is if a man touches his penis and prays, then \r\n    he finds out that the one who touches his penis has to do wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view in all these cases is that he does not have \r\n    to repeat the prayers, because Allaah has forgiven things done by mistake or \r\n    out of forgetfulness, and because He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to \r\n    give warning)&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Isra&rsquo; 17:15]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person has not heard \r\n    of the command of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) concerning a particular matter, then the obligation is \r\n    not confirmed in his case. Hence when &lsquo;Umar and &lsquo;Ammaar became junub and \r\n    &lsquo;Umar did not pray and &lsquo;Ammaar prayed after rolling in the dust, the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell either of them \r\n    to repeat the prayer. Similarly he did not tell Abu Dharr to repeat the \r\n    prayers when he was junub and did not pray for several days. And he did not \r\n    tell those of his companions who had eaten until they could distinguish the \r\n    white thread from the black thread to make up their fasts, and he did not \r\n    tell those who had prayed facing Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) before news of \r\n    the abrogation reached them to make up those prayers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A similar case is that of the woman who was suffering from \r\n    istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) and had not prayed for some time \r\n    because she thought that she did not have to pray. There are two views as to \r\n    whether such a woman has to make up the prayers she missed. One view is that \r\n    she does not have to make up the prayers &ndash; as was narrated from Maalik and \r\n    others &ndash; because when the woman who was suffering from istihaadah said to \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;I have been \r\n    bleeding heavily for some time and it prevents me from praying and fasting,&rdquo; \r\n    he told her what she should do in the future, and he did not tell her to \r\n    make up the prayers of the past.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It seems to me, based on mutawaatir reports, that with regard \r\n    to women and men living in the desert and elsewhere who have reached the age \r\n    of puberty and do not know that prayer is obligatory for them, and even if \r\n    it is said to such a woman, &ldquo;You have to pray&rdquo; and she says, &ldquo;Not until I \r\n    grow up and become an old woman, thinking that the command to pray is only \r\n    addressed to old women, and even the followers of some shaykhs (among the \r\n    Sufis) groups do not know that prayer is obligatory for them, according to \r\n    the correct view, they do not make to make up past prayers regardless of \r\n    whether it is said that they were kaafirs or they were excused for their \r\n    ignorance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 21\/101, \r\n    102.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also the answer to question no. 21806.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It may be noted here that \r\n    if the questioner was in a place where the means of acquiring knowledge were \r\n    available but he was careless and did not try to find out, then he has to \r\n    make up the prayers that he offered without ghusl from janaabah, so long as \r\n    he is not very old.

He said, &ldquo;O So and so, what kept you \r\n    from praying with the people?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I became \r\n    junub and there is no water.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;You should use clean earth, for it \r\n    will suffice you.&rdquo; According to another report the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) found water and gave a vessel of water to \r\n    the one who had become junub, and said, &ldquo;Go and pour this over yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This indicates that tayammum is a means of purification and \r\n    suffices instead of water, but if water is available then it must be used. \r\n    Hence the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him \r\n    to pour it on himself even though no new janaabah had occurred.

You did not pray, but I rolled in the dust \r\n    and prayed, and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    said, &lsquo;It would have been sufficient if you had struck the ground with your \r\n    hands then wiped your face and hands with them.&rsquo;&rdquo; &lsquo;Umar said: &ldquo;Fear Allaah, \r\n    O &lsquo;Ammaar!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;If you wish I will not narrate it.&rdquo; &lsquo;Umar said: &ldquo;We \r\n    accept what you say.&rdquo; According to another report, &lsquo;Ammaar said: &ldquo;O Ameer \r\n    al-Mu&rsquo;mineen, if you wish, because of your position, I will not tell it to \r\n    anyone.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) had forgotten that \r\n    event.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &ldquo; &lsquo;Umar said: &lsquo;Fear Allaah, O &lsquo;Ammaar!&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash; What this means is \r\n    that &lsquo;Umar said to &lsquo;Ammaar: Fear Allaah with regard to what you are \r\n    narrating, for perhaps you have forgotten or become confused.

He (or she) does not have the right to delay the \r\n    prayer beyond its prescribed time.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> \r\n    (10\/201):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Does tayammum mean that the junub person no longer has to do \r\n    ghusl at all? How many prayers may he offer with tayammum?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Tayammum takes the place of water, as Allaah has made the \r\n    earth a place of worship and a means of purification for the Muslims. If no \r\n    water is available or the person is unable to use it because of sickness, \r\n    then tayammum takes its place and remains sufficient until he finds water. \r\n    When he finds water he has to do ghusl to cleanse himself of the previous \r\n    janaabah. Similarly if the sick person recovers and Allaah heals him, he has \r\n    to do ghusl to cleanse himself from the previous janaabah from which he had \r\n    purified himself by means of tayammum, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Clean earth is the wudoo&rsquo; of the \r\n    Muslim if he cannot find water for ten years.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;When you find \r\n    water, then make it touch your skin.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from the \r\n    hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him); narrated by \r\n    al-Bazzaar and classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qattaan, from the hadeeth of Abu \r\n    Hurayrah may Allaah be pleased with him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the junub person finds water then he should make it touch \r\n    his skin, i.e. wash with it. With regard to his past prayers, they are valid \r\n    by virtue of the tayammum he did when water was not available or he was \r\n    unable to use it, because of sickness that prevented him from using it, \r\n    until the sickness ends and he recovers and until he finds water, if none was available, even if that takes a long time.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4454","question_id":"4454","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person has an erotic dream then when he wakes up he does \r\n    not see any trace of semen on his clothes, then he does not have to do \r\n    ghusl.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person thinks that \r\n    he had an erotic dream, but he did not see any semen, then he does not have \r\n    to go ghusl.

Ibn Qudaamah (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person has a wet dream or has \r\n    intercourse, and ejaculates, then he does ghusl, then some semen comes out \r\n    of him, the well-known view narrated from Ahmad is that he does not have to \r\n    do ghusl again. Al-Khallaal said: there are many reports from Abu \r\n    &lsquo;Abd-Allaah &ndash; i.e., Imam Ahmad &ndash; that say that all he has to do is wudoo&rsquo;, \r\n    whether he urinated or not, and this is the view that he settled on. This \r\n    was also narrated from &lsquo;Ali, Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, &lsquo;Ata&rsquo;, al-Zuhri, Maalik, al-Layth, \r\n    al-Thawri and Ishaaq.

This is the view of al-Awzaa&rsquo;i and Abu Haneefah, and was also \r\n    narrated from al-Hasan. That is because this is the left overs of what was \r\n    emitted as a result of desire, so ghusl is required as it was in the first \r\n    instance. But after urinating, it comes out without gushing and with no \r\n    feelings of desire, and we cannot be sure that it is something left over \r\n    from the first instance, because if it were something left over then it \r\n    would not have stayed after urinating.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Qaadi said: there is also a third opinion, which is that \r\n    he has to do ghusl in either case. This is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i, because \r\n    what matters is that it has come out, as in the case of all the things that \r\n    nullify purity. He said elsewhere: he does not have to do ghusl, because the \r\n    janaabah is one and the same so there is no need for two ghusls. It is as if \r\n    it all came out in one go&hellip; From <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/128.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that if it comes out with no feelings of \r\n    desire, then ghusl is not required, as it says in <i>al-Insaaf<\/i>, 1\/232; \r\n    and in <i>Kashshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo;<\/i>, 1\/141, where it says &ldquo;If semen comes out \r\n    after doing ghusl then ghusl is not required. Or if semen comes out &ldquo;after \r\n    doing ghusl following intercourse in which he did not ejaculate&rdquo;, with no \r\n    feelings of desire, then no ghusl is required; and if the remaining semen \r\n    comes out with no feelings of desire he does not have to do ghusl, because \r\n    of the report narrated from Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, that he was asked about something \r\n    coming out of a person after he had done ghusl from janaabah. He said: &ldquo;Let \r\n    him do wudoo&rsquo;.&rdquo; Something similar was narrated by Imam Ahmad from &lsquo;Ali. And \r\n    because this is one emission of semen so only one ghusl is required, as if \r\n    it all came out in one go. And because it came out with no feelings of \r\n    desire, as in the case when it is emitted because of cold. This is the \r\n    reason that Ahmad gave; he said: because the desire is past, and rather it \r\n    is a nullification of purity and I hope that wudoo&rsquo; will be sufficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    The words &ldquo;if something comes out after that, he does not have to do (ghusl) \r\n    again&rdquo; mean: if he does ghusl for this emission of semen, then some more \r\n    comes out when he starts to move about, then he does not have to repeat \r\n    ghusl. The evidence for that is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The reason is one and the same, so two ghusls are not \r\n    required.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; When it comes out after that, it is not accompanied by \r\n    feelings of pleasure. And ghusl is only required if it comes out with \r\n    feelings of pleasure.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if semen is emitted \r\n    anew with feelings of desire, then ghusl is required as a result of this new \r\n    reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 1\/281.

Al-Bukhaari (251) and Muslim (476) narrated that Maymoonah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I prepared water for the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for ghusl.

Then he was brought \r\n    a cloth but he did not use it.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you remove some impurity etc that does not invalidate ghusl because what is required in ghusl is to wash the entire body with water &ndash; as well as rinsing the mouth and nose, according to the correct opinion &ndash; with the intention of doing ghusl.

But it is recommended for the Muslim to hasten to do ghusl so that he\r\n    will always be in a state of tahaarah, as is the Sunnah, and because the angels do not\r\n    come near a person who is junub. The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    said: &ldquo;There are three things which the angels do not approach: the dead body of a\r\n    kaafir, a man who has perfumed himself with saffron (because this is frivolous and\r\n    foolish behaviour, and is an imitation of women &ndash; <i>Qayd al-Qadeer<\/i>, 3\/325), and a person who is junub, until he does ghusl.&rdquo; (Narrated by Abu\r\n    Dawood, 4180; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, 3522).<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a woman is busy and it is not easy for her to do\r\n    ghusl from janaabah straight after intercourse, this does not affect her and she is not\r\n    naajis.

This false belief is based on false and\r\n    fabricated ahaadeeth that have been narrated on this topic.

The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Um Salamah,\r\n    who said: &#147;I said, &#145;O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman who braids her hair,\r\n    should I undo it to do ghusl after having intercourse?&#146; (According to another report,\r\n    she said: &#145;and after my period?&#146;) He said, &#145;No. It is enough for you to\r\n    pour water on your head three times.&#146;&#148; (Reported by Muslim).

Then I brought him a\r\n    cloth, but he did not want it, and he started to wipe the water away with his hands.&#148;\r\n    (Agreed upon). A lot of the requirements (of ghusl) are listed in these two hadeeth.\r\n    Beginning on the right is important because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) liked to always start on the right when purifying himself. According to a\r\n    hadeeth narrated from &#145;Aa&#146;ishah, when the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl to purify himself from janaabah, he would call\r\n    for something like a milking-vessel, and he would take some water in his hands, then he\r\n    would start with the right side of his head, then the left. Then he would take some water\r\n    in his hands and start pouring it over his head.&#148; (Agreed upon). With regard to\r\n    washing the feet after doing ghusl, there was some dispute as to what Ahmad actually said.\r\n    According to one report, he said, &#145;I would rather wash them (the feet) after doing\r\n    wudoo&#146;, because of the hadeeth of Maymoonah.&#146; According to another report, he\r\n    said, &#145;We should act according to the hadeeth of &#145;Aa&#146;ishah, which says that\r\n    he did wudoo&#146; for prayer before doing ghusl.&#146; And Allaah knows best.<\/p>\r\n    <p>He said: &#147;If he does ghusl once and makes water reach every part\r\n    of his head and body, and does not do wudoo&#146;, that should be sufficient if he rinses\r\n    his mouth and nose and has the intention to do ghusl and wudoo&#146;, but in this case is\r\n    not doing that which is better.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is mentioned here is what is sufficient, but the perfect way is\r\n    preferable, which is why he said &#147;he is not doing that which is better&#148; i.e., if\r\n    he does no more than that, this is sufficient even though he is not doing what is perfect\r\n    and preferable. The phrase &#147;has the intention to do ghusl and wudoo&#146;&#148; means\r\n    that ghusl is sufficient for both if he has the intention for both. This is what was\r\n    stated by Ahmad. Another opinion was also narrated from him, which is that ghusl is not\r\n    sufficient for wudoo&#146; unless he does wudoo&#146; either before or after ghusl. This\r\n    is also one of the two opinions of al-Shaafa&#146;i, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that, and because both janaabah (major impurity) and\r\n    hadath (minor impurity) are present, and purification from both is required.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<\/p>\r\n    <i><p>&#147;&#133; approach not al-salaah (the prayer) when you are in a\r\n    drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state\r\n    of janaabah (i.e., in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except\r\n    when travelling on the road, till you wash your whole body&#133;&#148; [al-Nisa&#146;\r\n    4:43]<\/p>\r\n    <\/i><p>So the lack of ghusl has been made the factor that prevents a\r\n    person from praying, and if a person has done ghusl, he has no reason not to pray. Both\r\n    are acts of worship of the same type. In ghusl a lesser type is incorporated in a major\r\n    type, as &#145;umrah is incorporated in Hajj.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn &#145;Abd al-Birr said: The one who does ghusl to purify himself\r\n    from janaabah, if he does not do wudoo&#146; but he makes water reach every part of his\r\n    body, he has done what is required of him, because Allaah has enjoined upon the one who is\r\n    in a state of janaabah to do ghusl, not wudoo&#146;, when He says (interpretation of the\r\n    meaning): <i>&#147;&#133; if you are in a state of janaabah (i.e., had a sexual\r\n    discharge), purify yourself (bathe your whole body.&#148; [al-Maa&#146;idah 5:6]<\/i>. This\r\n    is the consensus of the scholars and there is no dispute among them; they are agreed that\r\n    it is mustahabb to do wudoo&#146; before doing ghusl, in emulation of the Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and because this reinforces and\r\n    perfects ghusl.<\/p>\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A <br> Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid"},{"id":"4485","question_id":"4485","answers":"<p><big>Praise be to Allaah.<span>&nbsp;<o>\r\n    <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n      <p><big>If <i>maniy<\/i> (fluid emitted at the point of climax)\r\n      comes out of a woman without intercourse, she has to do ghusl.

And Allah is \r\n    Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[Aal &lsquo;Imraan 3:31]<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second type of rulings are those of which the meaning is \r\n    known and the wisdom behind them is understood, such as the prohibition on \r\n    khamr (intoxicants), so as to protect the mind, body and wealth, and the \r\n    prohibition on dead meat and pork, because they are harmful, and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars were of the view that the meaning of \r\n    ghusl for janaabah may be understood on a rational basis; they said: The \r\n    emission of maniy (semen) affects the body with some measure of weakness, \r\n    laziness and exhaustion. Ghusl counters that and re-energises the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <i>I&lsquo;laam \r\n    al-Muwaqqi&lsquo;een<\/i>, 2\/77-78:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ghusl following emission of maniy is one of the most \r\n    beneficial things for the body, heart and soul, and indeed to every part of \r\n    the body, which is refreshed by doing ghusl. Ghusl counters the effects of \r\n    emission of maniy; this is something that is well known from experience. \r\n    Moreover, becoming junub makes one very tired but ghusl re-energizes one. \r\n    Hence Abu Dharr said, when he did ghusl for janaabah: It is as if I have \r\n    thrown a weight from me.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up: this is something that everyone who has any common \r\n    sense will understand and realize that ghusl after janaabah refreshes the \r\n    body and the heart. As janaabah causes one&rsquo;s heart and soul to become \r\n    alienated, doing ghusl takes away that alienation. Prominent doctors have \r\n    stated that doing ghusl after intercourse restores energy to the body; it is \r\n    one of the most beneficial things for body and soul, and not doing it is \r\n    harmful. The testimony of reason and sound human nature is sufficient to \r\n    show that it is good. And Allah is the source of strength.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allah knows best<span>. <\/span><\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4496","question_id":"4496","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Emission of maniy whilst doing ghusl must be one of two \r\n    things:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It happened with desire or<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    -<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>It happened without desire.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it happened with desire, then this invalidates the first \r\n    ghusl.

This was the view of al-Thawri and ashaab al-ra&rsquo;y.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Mundhir narrated \r\n    that &lsquo;Abd al-Rahmaan ibn &lsquo;Awf and &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas thought that the \r\n    menstruating woman who becomes pure one-rak&rsquo;ah before dawn should pray \r\n    Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;, and if she becomes pure before the sun sets, she should \r\n    pray Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr together.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Because the time for the \r\n    second prayer is the time for the first at the time when the excuse is \r\n    applicable, so when the one who had an excuse no longer has an excuse, then \r\n    he must offer the obligatory prayer, and he must offer the obligatory prayer \r\n    for the second prayer too. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) favoured&nbsp; the view that she only has to offer the \r\n    prayer the time of which she caught up with, and she does not have to join \r\n    to it the prayer that came before it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>In order to be on the safe \r\n    side, you should follow the view of the majority of scholars and offer the \r\n    two prayers together. But if a woman offers only the prayer the time of \r\n    which she caught up with, we hope that there is no sin on her. If a woman \r\n    did not do that in the past because she was unaware of the ruling, she does \r\n    not have to do anything, because of the general meaning of the evidence that \r\n    the one who is ignorant and the one who makes a mistake are excused, and \r\n    because the issue is one where there is a difference of scholarly opinion, \r\n    as stated above. <\/p>\r\n    <p>See also the answer to \r\n    question no.

[According to some scholars, you will not be \r\n    mustahaadah unless the bleeding lasts for most of a month.]&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is established that you are mustahaadah, then one of \r\n    three scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    You previously had a regular cycle, so you should count on \r\n    your former cycle and refrain from prayer etc. accordingly, then do ghusl \r\n    and pray. Any bleeding outside of your normal period is istihaadah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you did not previously have a regular cycle, then you have \r\n    to distinguish between types of bleeding: menstrual blood is dark and thick, \r\n    and has an unpleasant odour, and is usually accompanied by pains (cramps). \r\n    The blood of istihaadah is light and thin. So your menses is the days when \r\n    the blood is dark and thick, and the other blood is istihaadah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you cannot make this distinction, then you should refrain \r\n    from praying for six or seven days, because that is the usual length of \r\n    women&rsquo;s menses, then do ghusl and pray.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The woman who is mustahaadah may fast, pray and have \r\n    intercourse, but she must do wudoo&rsquo; for every obligatory prayer after the \r\n    time for it begins, and she may offer whatever naafil prayers she wants to \r\n    with that wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Cases of istihaadah, with evidence, have been discussed in \r\n    the answer to question no.

Drawing an analogy between intercourse with a woman experiencing \r\n    istihaadah and a woman who is menstruating is not correct, because they are \r\n    not the same, even in the view of those who think that it is haraam, and \r\n    analogies are not valid if the two things concerned are different.

But since no one narrated \r\n    any prohibition concerning that from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him), it is not permissible to regard it as haraam, since \r\n    it is known that he did not forbid that, and as he did not forbid that \r\n    despite the fact that menstruation was widespread at his time, it is known \r\n    that it is not haraam.

But she \r\n    has to make up any obligatory fasts that she misses, because of the hadeeth \r\n    of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: &ldquo;That &ndash; meaning \r\n    menses &ndash; used to happen to us and we were commanded to make up fasts but we \r\n    were not commanded to make up prayers.&rdquo; Agreed upon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a woman gets her menses when she is fasting, her fast \r\n    becomes invalid even if that happens just before Maghrib, and she has to \r\n    make up that day if it was an obligatory fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if she feels that the period was coming before Maghrib, \r\n    but no blood came out until after the sun set, then her fast is complete and \r\n    is not invalidated, according to the correct view, because there is no \r\n    ruling connected to blood that is still inside the body, and when the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about a \r\n    woman who sees in a dream what a man sees (i.e., an erotic dream), does she \r\n    have to do ghusl? He said: &ldquo;Yes, if she sees water.&rdquo; So the ruling is \r\n    connected to seeing water, not feeling body sensations.

In this case she should refer to the regular period that she \r\n    used to have, and during that time she should stop praying and she is \r\n    subject to the rulings on menses, and anything other than that is \r\n    istihaadah, and she is subject to the rulings on istihaadah at that time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: A woman used to get her period for 6 days at the \r\n    beginning of each month, then she began to experience istihaadah and she \r\n    bleeds all the time. So her period is the first six days of every month, and \r\n    everything else is istihaadah, because of the hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with her) according to which Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh \r\n    said: O Messenger of Allaah, I am experiencing istihaadah and I never become \r\n    pure; should I stop praying? He said: &ldquo;No, that is a vein. But stop praying \r\n    for the number of days that you used to menstruate, then do ghusl and pray.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari. In <i>Saheeh Muslim<\/i> it says that the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Umm Habeebah: &ldquo;Stop \r\n    praying for the number of days that your menses used to last, then do ghusl \r\n    and pray.&rdquo; Based on this, the woman who is experiencing istihaadah should \r\n    stop praying for the number of days that her period used to last, then she \r\n    should do ghusl and pray, and not worry about the bleeding at that time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; If she did not have a regular period before the \r\n    istihaadah, rather she has been experiencing istihaadah since the first time \r\n    she got her menses, then she should distinguish between different types of \r\n    blood. Her menses is when the blood is dark or thick or has a distinctive \r\n    odour, and she is subject to the rulings on menses at that time. Anything \r\n    other than that is istihaadah and she comes under the rulings on \r\n    istihaadah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: A woman sees blood when she first starts to \r\n    menstruate, and it is continuous, but for ten days it is dark and the rest \r\n    of the time it is red. Or she sees that it is thick for ten days and thin \r\n    for the rest of the time. Or she notices that for ten days it has the odour \r\n    of menstrual blood and for the rest of the time it has no odour. So her \r\n    menses is the dark blood in the first case, the thick blood in the second \r\n    and the blood that has an odour in the third. Everything apart from that is \r\n    istihaadah, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said to Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh: &ldquo;When it is menstrual blood it is \r\n    dark and recognizable, so when it&nbsp; is like that, then stop praying, and when \r\n    it is otherwise, do wudoo&rsquo; and pray, for that is from a vein.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa&rsquo;i; classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. \r\n    Although the isnaad and text of this hadeeth are subject to further \r\n    discussion, the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) followed it, and \r\n    that is better than trying to make her follow the pattern of the majority of \r\n    women. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; If she does not have a regular period and cannot \r\n    distinguish it properly because the istihaadah is ongoing from the first \r\n    time she saw the blood, and her blood is all the same or its characteristics \r\n    are varied but it cannot be menstrual blood. This woman should act on the \r\n    basis of what is the usual pattern among women, so her menses is six or \r\n    seven days each month, and she should start from the first time when she saw \r\n    blood; everything apart from that is istihaadah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: if the first time she saw blood was on the fifth \r\n    of the month, and it continued with no change to distinguish menstrual \r\n    bleeding by colour etc, then her period is six or seven days of each month \r\n    starting from the fifth of the month, because of the hadeeth of Hamnah bint \r\n    Jahsh (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I \r\n    bleed a great deal all the time.

As for passing \r\n    through the mosque, there is nothing wrong with that, subject to the \r\n    condition that there is no risk of the mosque being contaminated with the \r\n    blood that is coming out of her. If it is not permissible for her to stay in \r\n    the mosque, it is not permissible for her to go there to listen to halaqahs \r\n    and recitation of Qur&rsquo;aan, unless there is a place outside the mosque where \r\n    the sound can reach via loudspeakers, in which case there is nothing wrong \r\n    with her sitting there to listen to the dhikr. There is nothing wrong with a \r\n    woman listening to dhikr and recitation of Qur&rsquo;aan, as it is proven that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lay his \r\n    head in &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah&rsquo;s lap and recite Qur'aan when she was menstruating. But it \r\n    is not permissible for a menstruating woman to go to the mosque and stay \r\n    there to listen to dhikr or Qur&rsquo;aan recitation. Hence when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard, during the Farewell \r\n    Pilgrimage, that Safiyyah was menstruating, he said: &ldquo;Has she detained us?&rdquo; \r\n    because he thought that she had not done tawaaf al-ifaadah, but they said \r\n    that she had already done it. This indicates that it is not permissible to \r\n    stay in the mosque even for acts of worship. And it is proven that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told women to go \r\n    out to the Eid prayer-place to pray and remember Allaah (dhikr), but he told \r\n    the menstruating women to keep away from the prayer-place itself. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Fataawa al-Tahaarah<\/i>, p. 273.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See the views of the fuqaha&rsquo; in <i>al-Mabsoot<\/i>, 3\/153; <i>\r\n    Haashiyat al-Dasooqi<\/i>, 1\/173; <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/388; <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, \r\n    1\/195&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A menstruating woman may \r\n    read Qur&rsquo;aan without touching the Mus-haf, as we explained in the answer to \r\n    question no.

This indicates that \r\n    the reason for the ruling is menstruation, and whether it is present or not. \r\n    When menstruation is present, the ruling applies, and when the period ends \r\n    the attendant rulings no longer apply. Moreover there is no evidence for \r\n    putting a time limit on menses, even though there was a need (at the time of \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) to explain the \r\n    definition if any such definition had existed.

Based on \r\n    this, every time a woman sees the kind of blood which is known to women as \r\n    being menstrual blood, then it is menstrual blood without that being \r\n    restricted to a certain time, unless the bleeding is continuous and never \r\n    stops, or it stops only for a short time such as one or two days in the \r\n    month, in which case it is istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    11\/271&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on this, it is not \r\n    permissible for you to pray except after the period has ended and you have \r\n    done ghusl (full ablution).

As this is the \r\n    case, the fasting person is forbidden to eat and drink things that \r\n    strengthen him and nourish him, and he is forbidden to deliberately cause \r\n    his body to eject things that may weaken him. Otherwise if he were allowed \r\n    to do that, he would be a transgressor and one who goes to extremes in his \r\n    worship, and he would not be moderate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Things that come out of the body are of two types. The first \r\n    type is those that are unavoidable or which come out in a manner that does \r\n    not cause any harm.

But if a person vomits deliberately and \r\n    ejects the food and drink that give him nourishment, or masturbates \r\n    accompanied by feelings of desire &hellip; and the menstruation that causes blood \r\n    to flow.

It is governed by rulings which differ from those\r\n    governing menstruation. This blood (<i>istihaadah<\/i>) may be distinguished from the blood\r\n    of menstruation by the following:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Colour: menstrual blood is black [dark red] whilst the blood of\r\n    istihaadah is red.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Consistency: menstrual blood is thick and heavy, whilst the blood of\r\n    istihaadah is thin.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Smell: menstrual blood has an offensive odour whilst the blood of\r\n    istihaadah does not, because it comes from an ordinary vein.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Clotting: menstrual blood does not clot when it comes out of the body\r\n    whilst the blood of istihaadah does clot because it comes from a vein.<\/p>\r\n    <p>These are the characteristics of menstrual blood, so if this\r\n    description fits the blood that is coming out, it is hayd (menstruation); ghusl is waajib\r\n    (obligatory) and this blood is naajis (impure), but ghusl is not required in the case of\r\n    istihaadah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>When a woman has her period she is not allowed to pray, but when the\r\n    bleeding is istihaadah, that is not the case.

If blood\r\n    comes out whilst she is praying, it does not matter.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Thirdly; a woman can know that her period has ended by two things:<\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>The white discharge which comes from the womb to show that the period is\r\n        over.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Complete dryness, if a woman does not have this white discharge. In this\r\n        case she can find out if her period has ended by inserting a piece of white cotton or\r\n        something similar into the place where the blood comes from; if it comes out clean, then\r\n        her period is over and she has to do ghusl and pray. If the cloth comes out red, yellow or\r\n        brown, she should not pray.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n    <\/ol>\r\n    <p>The women used to send small containers in which were these cloths with\r\n    traces of yellow on them to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah, and she would say, &ldquo;Do not hasten\r\n    until you see the white discharge.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari <i>mu&rsquo;allaqan<\/i>.\r\n    <i>Kitaab al-Hayd, Baab iqbaal al-muhayd wa idbaarihi<\/i>.

It was also narrated by al-Bukhaari, 320,\r\n    but he did not mention &ldquo;after a woman&rsquo;s period was over.&rdquo;)<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;We did not bother about&rdquo; means we did not\r\n    think it was menstruation, but it is a <i>naajis<\/i> (impure) discharge which means that a\r\n    woman has to wash it away and do wudoo&rsquo;. But if the white discharge is immediately\r\n    followed by a period, then it is part of the period.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Fourthly: if a woman believes that her period has ended, then she\r\n    starts bleeding again, if the blood has the characteristics of menstrual blood as\r\n    described above, then this is menstrual bleeding, otherwise it is istihaadah. <\/p>\r\n    <p>If it is the former, she should not pray. If it is the latter, she\r\n    should be careful and do wudoo&rsquo; for each prayer, then pray.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Concerning the brownish discharge, if she sees this after her period\r\n    has ended, then the ruling is that it is taahir (pure), but it requires her to do\r\n    wudoo&rsquo; only.

It was\r\n    reported that the man who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity), in\r\n    particular, should not read Qur&rsquo;aan whilst he is junub, because of the hadeeth of\r\n    &lsquo;Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). With regard to the woman who is menstruating\r\n    or bleeding after childbirth there is the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Umar: &ldquo;The\r\n    menstruating woman and the man who is junub should not read Qur&rsquo;aan&rdquo; &ndash; but\r\n    it is da&rsquo;eef (weak), because the hadeeth was reported by Ismaa&rsquo;eel ibn\r\n    &lsquo;Ayyaash from the Hijaaziyeen, and he is da&rsquo;eef in his reports from them. But\r\n    she should read without touching the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur&rsquo;aan in Arabic), from\r\n    memory. In the case of the man who is junub, he should not recite Qur&rsquo;an at all,\r\n    either from memory or from the Mus-haf, until he has done ghusl. The difference between\r\n    them is that the timespan for the one who is junub is very short, he can do ghusl\r\n    straightaway, as soon as he finished having intercourse with his wife. He is not junub for\r\n    long, and it is up to him when he wants to do ghusl; if he cannot find water, he can do\r\n    tayammum (&ldquo;dry ablution&rdquo; using dust etc.) and pray and read Qur&rsquo;aan. But\r\n    the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth has no control over her\r\n    situation &ndash; it rests with Allaah, may He be glorified. The period lasts for a number\r\n    of days and nifaas (post-natal bleeding) is the same. So it is permissible for them to\r\n    recite Qur&rsquo;aan so that they do not forget it and so that they do not miss out on the\r\n    blessings of reciting Qur&rsquo;aan and learning the rules of sharee&rsquo;ah from the Book\r\n    of Allaah.

What makes it more likely to be correct is the fact that yellow and \r\n    brownish colours are among the colours of blood according to most of the \r\n    fuqaha&rsquo;.

That is, he has \r\n    to do ghusl and repeat the prayers from when he last slept. This is the \r\n    least complicated and the clearest of the scholarly opinions. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \r\n    al-Mukhtaar ash-Shanqeeti (may Allah preserve him) was asked about a woman \r\n    who saw some menstrual blood after Maghrib prayer, and she does not know \r\n    whether it came before Maghrib or after &ndash; what is the ruling on her prayer \r\n    and fasting?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>He replied: If she saw the \r\n    blood and thinks it most likely that it came before Maghrib, then there is \r\n    no doubt that the fast of that day is invalid and she has to make it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if she thinks it most \r\n    likely that the blood is fresh and that it happened after Maghrib, then \r\n    there is no doubt that her fast is valid and she has to pray Maghrib when \r\n    she becomes pure (i.e., her period ends and she does ghusl); she should make \r\n    it up and offer that prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if she is uncertain, \r\n    then the basic principle according to the scholars (may Allah have mercy on \r\n    them) is that it should be attributed to the closest time.

Among those who regarded it as obligatory is Ahmad&hellip; it is the \r\n    correct view that is well known and was stated by al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him), and the majority stated definitively that it is \r\n    obligatory for both men and women. end quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>Fath al-Baari<\/i>, 10\/340; <i>Kishshaaf al-Qinaa&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    1\/80&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That circumcision is Sunnah for both males and females. \r\n    This is the view of the Hanafis and Maalikis, and was narrated in one report \r\n    from Ahmad.

This view was also favoured by \r\n    al-Muwaffaq ibn Qudaamah in <i>al-Mughni<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>al-Tamheed<\/i>, 21\/60; <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/63&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (5\/223):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>\r\n    Circumcision is one of the Sunnahs of the fitrah, and it is \r\n    for both males and females, except that is it obligatory for males and \r\n    Sunnah and good in the case of women.

Even though there is a fiqhi principle which says that the \r\n    decree of a ruler may put an end to a dispute regarding controversial \r\n    matters, the decree of the ruler in this case cannot be but either of two \r\n    things: that it is either obligatory or recommended, and it is not correct \r\n    to issue a decree banning it, so as not to go against sharee&rsquo;ah which is the \r\n    principal source of legislation in our land, whose constitution states that \r\n    Islam is the official religion of the country. It is permissible to issue \r\n    some legislation that provides guidelines for performing this procedure \r\n    (female circumcision) in the proper manner in such a way that does not \r\n    contradict the rulings of sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp; <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words of the doctors and others are not definitive. \r\n    Scientific discoveries are still opening doors every day which change our \r\n    old perceptions.

As for the opinions of \r\n    doctors who say that female circumcision is harmful, these are individual \r\n    opinions which are not derived from any agreed scientific basis, and they do \r\n    not form an established scientific opinion. They acknowledge that the rates \r\n    of cancer among circumcised men are lower than among those who are not \r\n    circumcised, and some of these doctors clearly recommend that circumcision \r\n    should be done by doctors and not these ignorant women, so that the \r\n    operation will be safe and there will be no negative consequences.&nbsp; However, \r\n    medical theories about disease and the way to treat it are not fixed, rather \r\n    they change with time and with ongoing research. So it is not correct to \r\n    rely on them when criticizing circumcision which the Wise and All-Knowing \r\n    Lawgiver has decreed in His wisdom for mankind. Experience has taught us \r\n    that the wisdom behind some rulings and Sunnahs may be hidden from us. May \r\n    Allaah help us all to follow the right path.

In the \r\n    male it is also called i&rsquo;dhaar.

Abu Ya&rsquo;laa narrated that &lsquo;Ali ibn Rabaah said: &ldquo;Ibraaheem was commanded to circumcise himself, so he circumcised himself \r\n    with an adze and it was very painful for him. Then Allaah revealed to him saying, &ldquo;You rushed to do it before We told you what tool to use.&rdquo; He \r\n    said, &ldquo;O Lord, I did not want to delay obeying Your command.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Circumcision was one of the things with which \r\n    Allaah tested Ibraaheem, His Close Friend. He did them perfectly so Allaah made him a leader of mankind. It was narrated that he was the first one \r\n    who was circumcised, as mentioned above. What it says in <i>al-Saheeh<\/i> is that Ibraaheem circumcised himself when he was eighty years old. \r\n    After him, circumcision continued among the Messengers and their followers, even the Messiah. He was circumcised and the Christians affirm that, \r\n    and do not deny that, as they also affirm that he was forbidden the flesh of pigs&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tuhfat al-Mawdood<\/i>, \r\n    p. 158-159&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    them) differed as to the ruling on circumcision.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy \r\n    on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The most correct view \r\n    is that it is obligatory in the case of men and Sunnah in the case of women. The difference between them is that in the case of men, it serves an \r\n    interest which has to do with one of the conditions of prayer, namely purity (tahaarah), because if the foreskin remains, when the urine comes out \r\n    of the urethra, some of it will collect there, and this causes burning and infection every time the person moves, and every time the foreskin is \r\n    squeezed, some drops of urine come out, thus causing najaasah (impurity).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the case of women, it serves a useful \r\n    purpose which is to reduce desire. This is seeking perfection, not removing something harmful.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    1\/133-134&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him). Ibn Quddamah said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (1\/115): As for circumcision, it is obligatory for men and it is good in the case of \r\n    woman, but it is not obligatory for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>3 &ndash; Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Abu&rsquo;l-Barakaat said in his book al-Ghaayah: \r\n    In circumcision of a man, the skin at the tip of the penis (the foreskin) is removed; if he only removes most of it, that is permissible. It is \r\n    mustahabb to circumcise females provided that is not done in an extreme manner. It was narrated that &lsquo;Umar said to a woman who circumcised \r\n    females, &ldquo;Leave some of it if you circumcise (a girl).&rdquo; Al-Khallaal said in his <i>Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>: What is cut when circumcising: Muhammad ibn \r\n    al-Husayn told me that al-Fadl ibn Ziyaad told them: Ahmad was asked, How much should be cut in circumcision? He said, Until the glans (tip of the \r\n    penis) becomes visible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn al-Sabbaagh said in <i>al-Shaamil<\/i>: \r\n    What is obligatory in the case of a man is to cut the skin on the tip of the penis until the entire glans becomes visible. In the case of a woman, \r\n    it means cutting the skin that looks like the comb of a rooster at the top of the vagina, between the two labia; if it is cut the base of it \r\n    should be left like a date pit. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The well-known correct view is that \r\n    everything covering the glans must be cut.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, \r\n    1\/351&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Al-Juwayni said: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The hadeeth indicates that not too much of it \r\n    should be removed (in the case of women), because he said, &ldquo;Leave something sticking out and do not go to extremes in cutting.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Tuhfat al-Mawdood<\/i>, \r\n    190-192&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The point is that in the case of males, all \r\n    the skin covering the tip of the penis should be cut, but in the case of females only a part of the skin that is like a rooster&rsquo;s comb at the top \r\n    of the vagina should be cut.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>4 &ndash; The wisdom behind circumcision&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to a man, he cannot be clean from \r\n    urine unless he is circumcised, because drops of urine collect underneath the foreskin and he cannot be sure that they will not drip and make his \r\n    clothes and body impure. Hence &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn &lsquo;Abbaas was very strict on the issue of circumcision. Imam Ahmad said: Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas was very strict \r\n    on this matter, and it was narrated that there is no Hajj and no prayer for him, i.e., if a person is not circumcised his Hajj and prayer are not \r\n    valid. <i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 1\/115&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>With regard to the \r\n    wisdom behind the circumcision of women, it is to regulate their desire so it will be moderate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have \r\n    mercy on him) was asked about whether women should be circumcised or not. He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Praise be to Allaah. \r\n    Yes, they should be circumcised, i.e., the top of the piece of skin that looks like a rooster&rsquo;s comb should be cut. The Messenger of Allaah (S) \r\n    said to the woman who did circumcisions: &ldquo;Leave something sticking out and do not go to extremes in cutting. That makes her face look brighter and \r\n    is more pleasing to her husband.&rdquo; That is because the purpose of circumcising a man is to make him clean from the impurity that may collect \r\n    beneath the foreskin. But the purpose of circumcising women is to regulate their desire, because if a woman is not circumcised her desire will be \r\n    strong. Hence the words &ldquo;O son of an uncircumcised woman&rdquo; are used as an insult, because the uncircumcised woman has stronger desire. Hence \r\n    immoral actions are more common among the women of the Tatars and the Franks, that are not found among the Muslim women. If the circumcision is \r\n    too severe, the desire is weakened altogether, which is unpleasing for men; but if it is cut without going to extremes in that, the purpose will \r\n    be achieved, which is moderating desire. And Allaah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, \r\n    21\/114&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; It is permissible to pay money for \r\n    circumcision.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is permissible to \r\n    pay money for circumcision and for medical treatment. We do not know of any difference of opinion on this matter, because it is doing something \r\n    that is needed and which is allowed in sharee&rsquo;ah. So it is permissible to pay money for it, like all other permissible actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Al-Mughni<\/i>, 5\/314.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4637","question_id":"4637","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Noorah is \r\n    composed of calcium and arsenic and was used to remove hair.

Ibn Qudaamah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said: &ldquo;Section: With regard to circumcision, it \r\n    is obligatory for men and an honour for women, but is not obligatory for \r\n    them. This is the view of many of the scholars. Ahmad said: It is more \r\n    obligatory for a man, because if a man is not circumcised, then that skin is \r\n    covering the glans and it cannot be cleaned properly. And it is less \r\n    important for women.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Abu &lsquo;Abd-Allaah (i.e., Imam Ahmad) said: Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas was very \r\n    strict on this issue. It was narrated from him that there is no Hajj and no \r\n    prayer for one who is not circumcised. But al-Hasan granted a concession \r\n    with regard to that, and said: If a person becomes Muslim, it does not \r\n    matter if he is not circumcised. He said: Black and white people became \r\n    Muslim, and no one examined them, and they did not get circumcised. The \r\n    evidence that it is obligatory is that covering the &lsquo;awrah is obligatory, \r\n    and if it were not for the fact that circumcision is obligatory it would not \r\n    be permissible to transgress the sanctity of the person being circumcised \r\n    and look at his &lsquo;awrah in order to carry out this procedure. And this is one \r\n    of the symbols of the Muslims. So it is obligatory, as are all the other \r\n    symbols of Islam. If an adult man becomes a Muslim and he fears that being \r\n    circumcised will harm him, it is waived in his case, because ghusl and \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;, etc are also waived if there is the fear that they will cause harm, \r\n    so it is more appropriate that circumcision be waived (in this case).

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Trimming does not mean removing it altogether, rather it \r\n    means removing part of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The more correct view &ndash; and Allaah knows best &ndash; is the second \r\n    one, which is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache and not to shave it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (11\/<i>Baab al-Siwaak wa Sunan al-Fitrah<\/i>\/question \r\n    no. 54):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best is to trim the moustache as is the Sunnah. As for \r\n    shaving it, that is not Sunnah. The analogy drawn by some of them, that it \r\n    is prescribed to shave it as the head is shaved in Hajj is an analogy when a \r\n    clear text states something else, so this analogy does not carry any weight. \r\n    Hence Maalik said concerning shaving the moustache: It is an innovation that \r\n    has appeared among the people, but we should not turn away from what is \r\n    mentioned in the Sunnah, because following it is guidance, righteousness, \r\n    happiness and success. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: In a \r\n    number of ahaadeeth it says &ldquo;trim the moustache&rdquo;. Is shaving different from \r\n    trimming? Some people trim the first part of the moustache that is closest \r\n    to the upper lip, and they leave the hair of the moustache, so they trim \r\n    nearly half of the moustache and leave the rest. Is this what is meant? Or \r\n    does trimming the moustache mean shaving off all of it? Please advise me of \r\n    the manner in which the moustache should be trimmed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The saheeh ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicate that it is prescribed to trim \r\n    the moustache. For example, the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different \r\n    from the mushrikeen.&rdquo; (Agreed upon). And he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be \r\n    different from the Magians,&rdquo; and in some versions it says: &ldquo;Trim the \r\n    moustache.&rdquo; Trimming means cutting it very short. The one who cuts his \r\n    moustache very short so that the upper lip is visible or trims it is not to \r\n    blame, because the ahaadeeth mention two things, but it is not permissible \r\n    to leave the edges of the moustache, rather the whole moustache should be \r\n    trimmed or cut, in accordance with the Sunnah.

It is cleaner and healthier in terms of urination and intercourse,\r\n    and prevents infection, etc. These and other benefits far outweigh the pain caused, which\r\n    is less for infants than for adults. <\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, a number of the scholars have said that circumcision is\r\n    obligatory for males. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book <i>al-Mughni<\/i>:\r\n    &#147;Circumcision is an obligation for men and an honour, not an obligation, for\r\n    women.&#148; This is the opinion of a number of scholars. Ahmad said: &#147;It is more of\r\n    an obligation for men, because if a man is not circumcised, this piece of skin will be\r\n    dangling down over the head of the penis and it will be too difficult to clean left-over\r\n    urine properly.&#148; It is not so strict in the case of women. Abu &#145;Abd-Allaah said:\r\n    &#147;Ibn &#145;Abbaas used to be very strict in this matter, and it is reported that he\r\n    said that no Hajj or salaah would be accepted, i.e., from the one who is not\r\n    circumcised.&#148; Al-Hasan was more lenient; he said: &#147;If a person enters Islam, it\r\n    is not essential for him to be circumcised.&#148; And he said: &#147;Black and white\r\n    people embraced Islam, but not one of them was checked or forced to get circumcised.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The evidence that it is obligatory is the fact that covering the <i>&#145;awrah<\/i>\r\n    (private parts) is obligatory, so if circumcision were not obligatory, it would not be\r\n    permissible for the one who wants to be circumcised to uncover his <i>&#145;awrah<\/i> for\r\n    this purpose. Circumcision is one of the signs of a Muslim, and like the other signs, it\r\n    is obligatory. If an adult male embraces Islam and is afraid that circumcision would be\r\n    harmful for him, then he is excused, because a person may be excused from ghusl,\r\n    wudoo&#146;, etc., if he fears that they may be harmful for him, so it is more so in the\r\n    case of circumcision. If a person is confident that it will not be harmful, then he has to\r\n    do it. Hanbal said: &#147;I asked Abu &#145;Abd-Allaah about the Dhimmi (non-Muslim under\r\n    Islamic rule) who embraces Islam: did he think that he should be circumcised? He said:\r\n    &#145;There is no alternative to that (i.e. he has to).&#146; I asked: what if he or she\r\n    is advanced in age? He said: &#145;It is better for him to be circumcised, because of the\r\n    hadeeth: &#147;Ibraaheem was circumcised when he was eighty years old,&#148; and Allaah\r\n    says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&#147;&#133; it is the religion of your father\r\n    Ibraaheem&#133;&#148; [al-Hajj 22:78]<\/i>&#146;&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>So our advice to you is to go ahead and have your son circumcised by\r\n    someone who is skilled and experienced.

Hammaad \r\n    said: And &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Muhammad ibn &lsquo;Aqeel told me: I saw a few hairs of \r\n    the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in \r\n    the possession of Anas ibn Maalik that were dyed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A group (of scholars) \r\n    said that the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) used to use a great deal of perfume, and his hair had become red \r\n    from that, so people though that he had dyed it but he had not. Abu Rithmah \r\n    said: I came to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) with a son of mine, and he said: &ldquo;Is this your son?&rdquo; I said, \r\n    &ldquo;Yes, I bear witness to that.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;He is not responsible for your sins \r\n    and you are not responsible for his sins.&rdquo; He said: And I saw grey hair that \r\n    had been dyed red. Al-Tirmidhi said: This is the best and clearest report \r\n    that has been narrated concerning this, because the saheeh reports state \r\n    that the Prophet did not turn grey. Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated from \r\n    Sammaak ibn Harb that it was said to Jaabir ibn Samurah: &ldquo;Was there any grey \r\n    hair on the head of the Prophet?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;There was no grey hair on his \r\n    head except a few hairs at the parting, and when he put on perfume, its \r\n    colour covered them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From <i>Zaad al-Ma&rsquo;aad<\/i>, 1\/169&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to thinking of following the example of the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in dyeing the hair \r\n    when there is no grey hair, I know that there is a strong difference of \r\n    opinion as to whether the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) did in fact dye his hair or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, dyeing the hair as enjoined in the Sunnah is not \r\n    something that is done for its own sake, rather it is done to change grey \r\n    hair, and to be different from the Jews and Christians, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Change grey hairs \r\n    and do not be like the Jews.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Nasaa&rsquo;i, 4986; al-Tirmidhi, \r\n    1674.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It was narrated by Muslim (3924) that when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw grey hair on the head of Abu \r\n    Bakr&rsquo;s father, he said: &ldquo;Change this with something.&rdquo; According to \r\n    al-Bukhaari (5448) he said: &ldquo;The Jews do not dye their hair, so be different \r\n    from them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, dyeing the hair when there is no grey hair is \r\n    not Sunnah and is not regarded as following the Prophet&rsquo;s example, because \r\n    there is no reason to do that, and it does not serve the same shar&rsquo;i \r\n    interests as are achieved by dyeing grey hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The most that we can say is that it is permissible so long as it does not involve imitating the kuffaar or cause any harm to one's health, in which case it is haraam.

Some kind of adornment may be appropriate at \r\n    one time but not at others, or one kind of adornment may be appropriate for \r\n    young men and some other kind for old men but not for young men. Do you not \r\n    see that if the old man or the middle aged man trims his moustache, that \r\n    befits him and is an adornment for him, but if a young man does that, it \r\n    will look silly, because the beard has not grown yet and if he trims his \r\n    moustache when it first appears, his face will look silly, but when his \r\n    beard grows, if he trims his moustache, that is an adornment for him. It was \r\n    narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) that he said: &ldquo;My Lord commanded me to let my beard grow and to trim \r\n    the moustache.&rdquo; Narrated by Ibn Jareer and others; classed as hasan by \r\n    al-Albaani.

All of that is part of fulfilling \r\n    his duties towards his wife, so a man should do that on the basis of what is \r\n    appropriate and brings harmony, and he should adorn himself for his wife in \r\n    a way that makes her happy and keeps her chaste so that she is not tempted \r\n    by other men.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The same applies to kohl for men; there are some for whom it \r\n    is befitting and others for whom it is not befitting.

In <i>al-Furoo&lsquo;<\/i> it says: This wording, &ldquo;according to our \r\n    companions&rdquo; -- i.e., the Hanbalis -- implies that it is haraam. Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Qur&rsquo;aan, \r\n    Sunnah and scholarly consensus indicate that it is enjoined to be different \r\n    from the disbelievers and it is forbidden to resemble them in general terms, \r\n    because resembling them on the outside leads to resembling them in \r\n    blameworthy attitudes and actions, and even in beliefs, as it generates love \r\n    and friendship on the inside; by the same token, love on the inside \r\n    generates resemblance of the outside. Al-Tirmidhi narrated that the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;He is \r\n    not one of us who resembles people other than us.

In <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> it is narrated \r\n    that &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: Faatimah bint Abi \r\n    Hubaysh came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    and said: &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman who suffers irregular \r\n    bleeding (istihaadah) and I do not become pure; should I stop praying?&rdquo; The \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;No. That is just a vein and it is not menses. When the time of your regular \r\n    menses comes, stop praying, then when it ends wash the blood from yourself \r\n    and start praying again.&rdquo; He (Hishaam) said: My father (&lsquo;Urwah ibn \r\n    al-Zubayr) said: &ldquo;Then do wudoo&rsquo; for every prayer, until that time comes.&rdquo; \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (no. 228). Al-Haafiz said in <i>al-Fath<\/i> \r\n    concerning the additional material which speaks of wudoo&rsquo;: Some of them say \r\n    that this is mu&rsquo;allaq, but that is not correct, rather it was narrated with \r\n    the isnaad mentioned from Muhammad, from Abu Mu&rsquo;aawiyah, from Hishaam. \r\n    Al-Tirmidhi explained that in his narration. Someone else claimed that the \r\n    words &ldquo;Then do wudoo&rsquo;&rdquo; are the words of &lsquo;Urwah, but this is debatable, \r\n    because if they were his words, he would have spoken in the third person, \r\n    and said, &ldquo;Then she should do wudoo&rsquo;&rdquo; etc. But as it appears in the \r\n    imperative, it goes with the instructions mentioned in the marfoo&rsquo; report \r\n    when he said, &ldquo;Then wash the blood from yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>End quote.\r\n    <i>Al-Fath<\/i>, 1\/332; see also 1\/409 and <i>al-Irwa&rsquo;<\/i> 1\/146, 224.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second \r\n    opinion is that it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;. This is the view of Ibn \r\n    Hazm.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh \r\n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah has two views on this issue, like the two views \r\n    mentioned above. In <i>al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i> he favoured the view that it does \r\n    not invalidate wudoo&rsquo; and in <i>Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa <\/i>he favoured the view \r\n    of the majority.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>See: <i>\r\n    Majmoo&rsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i> (21\/221) and <i>al-Ikhtiyaaraat<\/i> (p. 27).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen discussed the two views in detail and said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>After \r\n    researching the matter, it seems to me that the discharge that comes from a \r\n    woman, if it does not come from the bladder and it comes from the uterus, \r\n    then it is taahir, but it invalidates wudoo&rsquo; even though it is taahir, \r\n    because it is not essential for the thing that invalidates wudoo&rsquo; to be \r\n    naajis. The wind that comes from the back passage has no substance, but it \r\n    still invalidates wudoo&rsquo;. Based on this, if it is emitted by a woman and she \r\n    has wudoo&rsquo;, then her wudoo&rsquo; is invalidated and she has to renew it. But if \r\n    it is continuous then it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, but she should not do \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; for prayer until the time for the prayer begins. Then she may offer \r\n    both obligatory and naafil prayers, read Qur&rsquo;aan and do whatever she wants \r\n    of permissible things, as the scholars said concerning one who suffers from \r\n    urinary incontinence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is the \r\n    ruling on this discharge with regard to purity; it is taahir and does not \r\n    make clothing or the body naajis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>As for the \r\n    ruling with regard to wudoo&rsquo;, it invalidates wudoo&rsquo; unless it is continuous. \r\n    If it is continuous it invalidates wudoo&rsquo; but the woman does not have to do \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; for any prayer until after the time for it has begun, and she has to \r\n    wear sanitary pads.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if it \r\n    comes and goes, and it usually stops during the times of prayer, then she \r\n    should delay her prayer until the times when it stops, so long as there is \r\n    no fear of the time for prayer ending. If she fears that the time for prayer \r\n    will end, then she should do wudoo&rsquo; and wear a sanitary pad and pray. It \r\n    makes no difference whether there is a little or a lot, because all of it is \r\n    coming from the same place and a little of it or a lot invalidates wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard \r\n    to the belief of some women that it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, I know of no \r\n    basis for this apart from the view of Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him), who said that it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, but he did not mention \r\n    any evidence for that. If he had any evidence from the Qur&rsquo;aan or Sunnah or \r\n    sayings of the Sahaabah, that would be proof. Women should fear Allaah and \r\n    strive to purify themselves, because prayer is not accepted without purity, \r\n    even if a woman prays one hundred times. Some scholars even say that the one \r\n    who prays without being pure is a kaafir because this is a kind of mocking \r\n    the signs of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><i>Majmoo&rsquo; \r\n    Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;thaymeen<\/i> (1\/284-286)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>For more \r\n    information please see question no. \r\n    [fatin]7776[\\fatin] and \r\n    [fatin]13948[\\fatin].<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4688","question_id":"4688","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>The society of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with them all) was extremely keen to protect women and cover their &lsquo;awrahs, and a woman is all &lsquo;awrah, as the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said.

It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: \r\n    The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    passed by two graves and said, &ldquo;They are being punished, but they are not \r\n    being punished for something that was difficult to avoid.

See the answer to \r\n    question no. [fatin]9790[\\fatin].&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly, with regard to the points raised in the question:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If najaasah (impurity) gets onto a person&rsquo;s clothes, he does \r\n    not have to do ghusl, because najaasah is not one of the things that \r\n    invalidate wudoo&rsquo; or ghusl. Rather ghusl is required in the case of major \r\n    impurity and wudoo&rsquo; is required in the case of minor impurity. But what he \r\n    has to do in this case is to remove the impure material (najaasah).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We are commanded to remove impurity from our clothes because \r\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;And purify your garments&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Muddaththir 74:4]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>And the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood \r\n    that gets on the clothes, &ldquo;Take hold of the soiled <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    place, rub it and put it in water and rub it in order to \r\n    remove the traces of blood and then pour water over it. Then pray in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If najaasah gets onto something that can be wrung out, then \r\n    this is what must be done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Removing the impurity may be done by washing it until the \r\n    traces of the impurity have&nbsp; disappeared. So if the najaasah gets onto his \r\n    clothes, he only has to wash the part of the garment where the impurity is, \r\n    and he does not have to wash the rest of it. Also, he does not have to \r\n    change his clothes, but if he wants to change his clothes there is nothing \r\n    wrong with him doing that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; With regard to the ruling on praying in a garment on \r\n    which there is some impurity, it should be noted that being pure and free \r\n    from najaasah is a condition of the prayer being valid, and if a person is \r\n    not free from impurity then his prayer is invalid, because he prayed when he \r\n    was contaminated with this impurity, So if he prays when he is contaminated \r\n    with impurity then he has prayed in a manner that is not enjoined by Allaah \r\n    and His Messenger. It was narrated that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whoever does an action that is not \r\n    part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    When impurities get onto clothes, one of the following \r\n    scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When a person is certain that \r\n    impurity has gotten onto a particular part of his garment, in which case he \r\n    must wash the area where the impurity is.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When he thinks it most likely \r\n    that the impurity is on a particular part of the garment.<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>When a person thinks that there \r\n    may be some impurity in some part of the garment.

This is the view of Abu Haneefah and was the \r\n    view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, especially with regard to \r\n    problems that many people face, because it is too difficult to be thorough \r\n    and to clean it properly all the time. Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and [Allaah] has not laid upon you in religion any \r\n    hardship&rdquo;<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Hajj 22:78]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is the view of Abu Haneefah and Ibn \r\n    Taymiyah. Among the small amounts of impurity that may be overlooked because \r\n    it is too difficult to guard against it is a small amount of urine in the \r\n    case of one who suffers from incontinence but tries to guard against it as \r\n    much as he can.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i> by Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen, 1\/382&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to what \r\n    constitutes a small amount, whatever ordinary people consider to be a lot is \r\n    a lot, and whatever they consider to be a little is a little. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    On this basis it may be said that the basic principle is that \r\n    if a few drops of urine get on a person&rsquo;s garment and he washes off whatever \r\n    got on it, until he thinks it most likely that the najaasah has disappeared, \r\n    then whatever is left and is not washed comes under the heading of the small \r\n    amount of najaasah that may be overlooked, as stated above. And Allaah knows \r\n    best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about the case of one who is \r\n    unaware of the najaasah. He said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If he does not find out that it is impure until after he has \r\n    finished praying, then his prayer is valid, because when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was told by Jibreel whilst he \r\n    was praying that there was something dirty on his shoe, he did not repeat \r\n    the first part of his prayer. The same applies if he knows about it (i.e., \r\n    the impurity) before he prays, then he forgets and prays wearing (the \r\n    garment with the impurity), and does not remember until after he has \r\n    finished praying, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <h1>&ldquo;Our Lord!

Then if \r\n    he is not sure whether he has removed the impurity or not, he should go by \r\n    that which is certain, which is that he has not yet removed the impurity. \r\n    The converse also applies, if he is certain that his clothes are pure, then \r\n    he is not sure whether something impure got onto them or not, he should go \r\n    by that which is certain, which is that his clothes are pure because that is \r\n    what he is certain of.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen said: with regard to a person&rsquo;s \r\n    clothes, the basic principle is that they are taahir (pure) so long as he is \r\n    not certain that some impurity has gotten onto his body or clothes. This \r\n    basic principle is supported by what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) said when a man complained to him that something \r\n    happened to him during his prayer &ndash; i.e., he broke his wudoo&rsquo;. The Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: &ldquo;Do not stop \r\n    praying unless you hear a sound or detect a smell.&rdquo; If a person is not sure \r\n    about it, then the basic principle is that he is taahir (pure). A person may \r\n    think it is more likely that his clothes have become contaminated with \r\n    najaasah but so long as he is not certain, the basic principle is that they \r\n    remain taahir.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, 11\/107&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>5 &ndash; The only thing that is not permissible if a person has najaasah on his clothes is prayer, even if he has not broken his wudoo&rsquo;.

May Allah reward you with \r\n    good.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the impurity that is on the carpets is not clearly \r\n    visible, then it seems that it does not affect anyone who steps on it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, what usually happens is that when a person washes \r\n    his feet after wudoo' and then steps on the carpet, the carpet quickly dries \r\n    whatever wetness is on his feet at first, so it is possible to wash the mats \r\n    that are placed close to the bathrooms to dry the feet after wudoo', and \r\n    after that it will not matter if one steps on the contaminated carpets \r\n    because the feet are no longer damp after stepping on the carpets that are \r\n    nearest to the bathrooms. There is no need for this strictness in telling \r\n    people not to step on those impure carpets. You can put towels at the doors \r\n    of the bathrooms which will absorb the dampness from the feet after \r\n    finishing wudoo', and after that any slight dampness on the feet will not \r\n    matter and will not invalidate the prayer or transfer impurity.

She says, &ldquo;I feel that my clothes got dirty.&rdquo; In that case, she is \r\n    not certain that there was any impurity on her clothes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on that, if the Muslim is certain that there is any \r\n    impurity on his body or garment, what he has to do is remove it, and it is \r\n    not permissible for him to pray in that garment before he removes the \r\n    impurity. If he is uncertain as to whether there is any impurity, then he \r\n    should not pay any attention to it, because the basic principle is that \r\n    there is no impurity and he does not have to do anything further if he \r\n    prayed or circumambulated the Ka&lsquo;bah when this was the case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have \r\n    mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Islam &ndash; praise be to Allah &ndash; is complete in all aspects and \r\n    is suited to the nature of man as Allah created him. It is a religion of \r\n    ease and in fact came to keep man away from confusion, whispers and thoughts \r\n    for which there is no basis. Based on that, the basic principle with regard \r\n    to the individual and his garments is that they are pure, unless there is \r\n    certainty that there is any impurity on his body or garments. This basic \r\n    principle is attested to in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of \r\n    Allah be upon him) when a man complained to him that he thought that he \r\n    found something whilst praying &ndash; referring to minor impurity. The Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not stop until you hear \r\n    a sound or notice a smell.&rdquo;. So the basic principle is that things remain as \r\n    they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to clothes that people wear when entering \r\n    bathrooms and relieving themselves &ndash; as mentioned in question &ndash; if they get \r\n    damp, who can be certain that this dampness is caused by an impurity such as \r\n    urine or water tainted with stools and the like? If we are not certain about \r\n    that, then the basic principle is that things remain pure (taahir). It is \r\n    true that he may think it most likely the case that it has been contaminated \r\n    with something impure, but so long as we are not certain of that, then the \r\n    basic principle is that it remains pure.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So in answer to this question, we say: if they are not \r\n    certain that their garments have got anything impure on them, then the basic \r\n    principle is that they remain pure and they do not have to wash their \r\n    garments. They can pray in them with no problem. And Allah knows best.

However it is \r\n    better to avoid using their vessels and garments until they have been \r\n    washed. Al-Hajaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in <i>Zaad \r\n    al-Mustaqni&lsquo;<\/i>: It is permissible to use the vessels of the kuffaar, even \r\n    if their meat is not halaal, and to use their garments if it is not known \r\n    what state they are in.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If \r\n    someone were to ask, what is the evidence for that?

Moreover, if Allah has permitted us to \r\n    eat the food of the People of the Book, then it is well known that they \r\n    sometimes bring it to us cooked in their vessels. And it is proven that the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was invited by a Jewish \r\n    boy to eat some barley bread and fat, and he ate some of it. Similarly, he \r\n    ate some of the poisoned mutton that was given to him (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) in Khaybar. And it is proven that he (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions did wudoo&rsquo; from the waterskin \r\n    of a mushrik woman. All of that indicates that whatever has been handled by \r\n    the kuffaar is taahir (pure).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the hadeeth of Abu Tha&lsquo;labah al-Khushani, \r\n    according to which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    said: &ldquo;Do not eat from them (vessels of the kuffaar) unless you cannot find \r\n    anything else, (in which case) wash them and eat from them&rdquo;, this indicates \r\n    that it is better to avoid using them, but many of the scholars interpreted \r\n    this hadeeth as referring to people who are known to handle and deal with \r\n    impurities such as pork and the like. They said: the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) forbade eating from their vessels unless we \r\n    cannot find anything else, in which case we should wash them and may then \r\n    eat from them. This interpretation is good and it is in accordance with the \r\n    guidelines of sharee&lsquo;ah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words &ldquo;and their garments&rdquo; mean their garments are \r\n    permissible. That includes what they manufacturer and what they wear. Their \r\n    garments that they manufacture are permissible and we do not say that \r\n    perhaps they were woven on an impure loom or dyed with an impure dye, \r\n    because the basic principle is that things are permissible and pure. \r\n    Similarly, clothes that they have worn are also permissible for us to wear, \r\n    but in the case of those whom it is known do not take care to avoid \r\n    impurities, such as the Christians, it is better to avoid wearing them, \r\n    based on the implications of the hadeeth of Abu Tha&lsquo;labah al-Khushani (may \r\n    Allah be pleased with him).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The words &ldquo;if the condition is not known&rdquo; may be understood \r\n    in two ways:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>That they are known to be pure<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>or that they are known to be \r\n    impure. <\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it is known that they are impure then they should not be \r\n    used until they have been washed. If it is known that they are pure then \r\n    there is no problem. Rather the problem arises when their condition is not \r\n    known. Should we say that the basic principle is that they do not take \r\n    precautions to avoid impurities and they are haraam, or should we say that \r\n    the basic principle is that things are pure unless it is proven that they \r\n    are impure?

That is because the \r\n    basic principle concerning substances is that they are pure, and we cannot \r\n    regard anything as impure or haraam except on the basis of evidence to that \r\n    effect, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;He has explained to you in detail what \r\n    is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity&rdquo; <\/span>\r\n    <\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[al-An &lsquo;aam 6:119]<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>&ldquo;And Allah will never lead a people \r\n    astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they \r\n    should avoid&rdquo;<\/span><\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i><span>[at-Tawbah 9:115]<\/span><\/i><span>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) said in the saheeh hadeeth: &ldquo;One of the most serious sins a \r\n    Muslim may commit is to ask about something that was not forbidden, then it \r\n    becomes forbidden because of his asking.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <span>In <i>as-Sunan<\/i> it is narrated from \r\n    Salmaan al-Faarisi in a marfoo&lsquo; report that he said: &ldquo;What is permissible is \r\n    that which Allah has permitted in His Book, and what is forbidden is that \r\n    which Allah has forbidden in His Book. And what He has said nothing about is \r\n    that which He has forgiven. As that is the case, the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The purification of the vessel of one of \r\n    you, if it is licked by a dog, is to wash it seven times, the first of which \r\n    should be with dust.&rdquo; All versions of this hadeeth mention nothing except \r\n    licking; they do not mention any other parts of the dog, so regarding the \r\n    dog itself as impure is a conclusion that is reached only by analogy&hellip; With \r\n    regard to every animal that was said to be impure, the argument concerning \r\n    its hair or feathers is like the argument concerning the hair of the dog. If \r\n    it is said that every wild animal that has fangs and every bird that has \r\n    talons is impure &ndash; except cats and whatever is smaller than them, as is the \r\n    view of many of the scholars, the scholars of the people of Iraq, and it is \r\n    the better known of the two reports from Ahmad &ndash; then the issue of the hair \r\n    or feathers of such creatures is subject to the same argument, whether it is \r\n    impure or not. There are two reports from Ahmad, one of which says that it \r\n    is pure. This is also the view of the majority, such as Abu Haneefah, ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i \r\n    and Maalik. The second view is that it is impure, which is the view favoured \r\n    by many of the later companions of Ahmad.

If the command of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) concerning a specific matter has not reached a person, \r\n    then the ruling that it is obligatory has not been proven to him.

Similarly, \r\n    when Abu Dharr became junub and did not pray for several days, he did not \r\n    tell him to make up the prayers; and he did not tell the Sahaabah who ate \r\n    until the white thread became distinct from the black to make up that fast; \r\n    and he did not tell those who prayed facing Jerusalem before news of the \r\n    abrogation to make up those prayers reached them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This also includes the woman who suffers from istihaadah \r\n    (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) who does not pray for a while, because she \r\n    thinks that prayer is not obligatory for her. There are two views as to \r\n    whether making up the prayers is obligatory for her, one of which is that \r\n    she does not have to make them up, as was narrated from Maalik and others, \r\n    because when the woman who suffered from istihaadah said to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;I have been bleeding severely, \r\n    heavily and awfully, and it prevented me from praying and fasting,&rdquo; he told \r\n    her what she had to do in the future, and he did not tell her to make up \r\n    past prayers.

This is the view \r\n    of Ishaaq, al-Muzani, al-Hasan al-Basri and Ibn al-Mundhir, because of the \r\n    hadeeth of Safwaan ibn &lsquo;Assaal (may Allaah be pleased with him) quoted \r\n    above, where he mentioned sleep as one of the things that invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, \r\n    and did not define it any further.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; That sleep does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo; in all cases, \r\n    because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik, according to which the Sahaabah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to wait for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; at the time of the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until \r\n    their heads drooped, then they prayed and they did not do wudoo&rsquo;. Narrated \r\n    by Muslim, 376. According to the report of al-Bazzaar: they would lie on \r\n    their sides.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of Abu Moosa al-Ash&rsquo;ari (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) and Sa&rsquo;eed ibn al-Musayyib.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These two views are opposite, and each of them is based on a \r\n    part of the evidence. However the majority of scholars reconciled this \r\n    evidence and said that sleep invalidates wudoo&rsquo; in certain circumstances and \r\n    not in others, although they differed in the way in which they reconciled \r\n    between the evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; If a person sleeps sitting with his backside firmly on \r\n    the ground, it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, and if his backside is not firmly \r\n    on the ground, it does invalidate wudoo&rsquo;, regardless of what position he is \r\n    in. This is the view of the Hanafis and Shaafa&rsquo;is. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/14&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4 &ndash; Sleep invalidates wudoo&rsquo; except light sleep in the case \r\n    of one who is sitting or standing. This is the view of the Hanbalis. See <i>\r\n    al-Insaaf<\/i>, 2\/20, 25&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason why an exception is made in the case of light \r\n    sleep of one who is sitting or standing is that in this case the place where \r\n    wind is emitted will be joined together and in this case one may think it \r\n    most likely that he has not broken his wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5 &ndash; Some of them said: a great deal of sleep invalidates \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; whatever the case, unlike a little sleep. This is the view of Maalik \r\n    and was narrated in one report from Ahmad.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The difference between a great deal of sleep and a little is \r\n    that a great deal of sleep is deep sleep in which a person does not feel \r\n    that he has broken his wudoo&rsquo; if that takes place. A little sleep is that in \r\n    which a person does feel that he has broken his wudoo&rsquo; if that takes place, \r\n    such as passing wind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This view is the one favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah \r\n    (may Allaah have mercy on him), and among our contemporary scholars it was \r\n    the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen and the scholars \r\n    of the Standing Committee, and it is the correct view. This view reconciles \r\n    all the evidence, for the hadeeth of Safwaan ibn &lsquo;Assaal indicates that \r\n    sleep invalidates wudoo&rsquo; and the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with \r\n    him) indicates that it does not do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The hadeeth of Anas is to be interpreted as referring to \r\n    light sleep in which a person can feel that he has broken his wudoo&rsquo; if that \r\n    takes place, and the hadeeth of Safwaan is to be interpreted as referring to \r\n    deep sleep in which a person does not feel if he breaks his wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is supported by the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;The eye is the string that ties the anal \r\n    sphincter; when the eyes sleep, the string is loosened.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad, \r\n    4\/97; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&rsquo;<\/i>, 4148.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What this means is that wakefulness is the string that ties \r\n    the anal sphincter, i.e. it keeps what is inside from coming out, because so \r\n    long as a person is awake he can feel what comes out, but when he sleeps the \r\n    string is loosened.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Teebi said: When a person is awake, he keeps control of \r\n    what is in his stomach but when he sleeps he loses that control and his \r\n    muscles relax. End quote from <i>&lsquo;Awn al-Ma&rsquo;bood<\/i>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If a person cannot \r\n    control his sphincter in the sense that if he breaks his wudoo&rsquo; he cannot \r\n    feel it, then his sleep invalidates wudoo&rsquo;, otherwise it does not. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See: <i>al-Sharh al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 1\/275&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-San&rsquo;aani said in <i>Subul al-Salaam<\/i> (1\/97):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The most likely to be \r\n    correct is the view that sleep invalidates wudoo&rsquo;, because of the hadeeth of \r\n    Safwaan&hellip; but the word nawm (sleep) in his hadeeth is general in meaning, and \r\n    there is the hadeeth of Anas which speaks of the sleep of the Sahaabah and \r\n    says that they did not do wudoo&rsquo; even if they snored, and that they used to \r\n    lie on their sides, and that they would be woken up. The basic principle is \r\n    that they are people of integrity and that they were not unaware of what \r\n    invalidates wudoo&rsquo;, especially since Anas narrated this from the Sahaabah in \r\n    general, and it is well known that among them were knowledgeable men who had \r\n    deep knowledge of the religion, especially the prayer which is the greatest \r\n    pillar of Islam, and especially those among them who used to wait to pray \r\n    with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They were \r\n    the elite of the Sahaabah, and as that is the case, the general wording of \r\n    the hadeeth of Safwaan is to be taken as referring to deep sleep only, in \r\n    which a person is no longer aware, and what Anas said about snoring, lying \r\n    on their sides and being woken up is to be understood as referring to sleep \r\n    that was not deep, because a person may snore at the beginning of sleep, \r\n    before sleep has become deep, and lying one one&rsquo;s side does not necessarily \r\n    mean that one is sleeping deeply. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> <i>al-Fataawa<\/i>, when listing the things that invalidate \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>A great deal of sleep \r\n    means if it is such that the sleeper does not feel it if he breaks his \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;. But if the sleep is light and the sleeper can feel it if he breaks \r\n    his wudoo&rsquo;, then sleep does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;. It makes no difference if \r\n    the sleeper is lying down, sitting leaning on something or sitting without \r\n    leaning. What matters is the level of awareness. If it is such that he will \r\n    feel it if he breaks his wudoo&rsquo;, then his wudoo&rsquo; is not invalidated by \r\n    sleep. If he is in a state where he would not feel it if he breaks his \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;, then he must do wudoo&rsquo;, because sleep itself does not invalidate \r\n    wudoo&rsquo;, rather there is the probability that one has broken one's wudoo&rsquo; \r\n    when sleeping. But if one is still aware and can be certain that he has not \r\n    broken his wudoo&rsquo; because he can feel it if it happens, then sleep does not \r\n    invalidate his wudoo&rsquo;. The evidence that sleep itself does not invalidate \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; is the fact that light sleep does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo;. If sleep did \r\n    invalidate wudoo&rsquo; then a little or a lot of it would do so, just as a little \r\n    or a lot of urine invalidates wudoo&rsquo;. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly in <i>Fataawa Ibn Baaz<\/i> (10\/144) it says:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sleep invalidates wudoo&rsquo; if it is so deep that one is no \r\n    longer aware, because the great Sahaabi Safwaan ibn &lsquo;Assaal al-Muraadi (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) said:&nbsp; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to command us, if we were travelling, \r\n    not to take off our khufoof for three days and nights, except in the case of \r\n    janaabah, but not in the case of stools, urine or sleep. Narrated by \r\n    al-Nasaa&rsquo;i and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Mu&rsquo;aawiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that \r\n    the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The eye \r\n    is the string that ties the anal sphincter; when the eyes sleep, the string \r\n    is loosened.&rdquo; Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabaraani. Its isnaad contains some \r\n    weakness, but there are corroborating reports that support it, such as the \r\n    hadeeth of Safwaan mentioned above, thus it is counted as a hasan hadeeth. \r\n    As for feeling drowsy, this does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo; because it does not \r\n    cause loss of awareness. Thus the ahaadeeth that have been narrated on this \r\n    topic can be reconciled. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Deep sleep may lead to \r\n    breaking of wudoo&rsquo;, so whoever sleeps deeply in the mosque or elsewhere has \r\n    to repeat his wudoo&rsquo;, whether he was standing, sitting or lying down, and \r\n    whether he has a masbahah in his hand or not. But if the sleep is not deep, \r\n    such as dozing off, in which one does not lose awareness, he does not have \r\n    to repeat his wudoo&rsquo;, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth which have been \r\n    narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    concerning that, as mentioned above.

The fact that he said, &#147;If you wish&#148; indicates that these ahaadeeth\r\n    came after the hadeeth of Jaabir.<\/p>\r\n    <p>In cases of abrogation there must be evidence that what is being\r\n    abrogated came first chronologically, and there is no such evidence here.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Moreover, the hadeeth of abrogation is general in meaning, but this\r\n    hadeeth (about camel meat) is more specific, and thus excludes (camel meat) from the\r\n    general ruling.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fact that he also asked about mutton makes it clear that the issue\r\n    here is not whether the meat has been touched by fire; if that were the case then camel\r\n    meat and mutton would be regarded in the same way.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(B) They also take their evidence from the hadeeth, &#147;Wudoo&#146;\r\n    has to do with what comes out, not what goes in.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Response:<\/p>\r\n    <p>This hadeeth was narrated and classed as <i>da&#146;eef<\/i> (weak) by\r\n    al-Bayhaqi (1\/116) and al-Daaraqutni (p. 55).

It is obligatory to interpret the terminology of sharee&#146;ah in\r\n    accordance with the meanings of sharee&#146;ah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(D) Some of them take as evidence a story that has no basis; the story\r\n    in question may be summed up as follows:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was addressing\r\n    the people one day, and one of them emitted an odour (i.e., passed wind), but he felt too\r\n    shy to get up from among the people. He had also eaten camel meat, so the Messenger of\r\n    Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, covering for him, &#147;Whoever\r\n    has eaten camel meat, let him do wudoo&#146;.&#148; So a group of people who had eaten\r\n    camel meat got up and went and did wudoo&#146;.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Response:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>This story has no basis anywhere in the books of Sunnah or elsewhere in\r\n    the books of Fiqh and Tafseer, as far as I know.<\/p>\r\n    <p>(<i>al-Silsilah al-Da&#146;eefah<\/i>, 3\/268).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The correct view regarding this matter is that the\r\n    ruling on doing wudoo&#146; after eating anything that has been touched by fire has been\r\n    abrogated, but it is obligatory to do wudoo&#146; after eating camel meat.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Nawawi said:<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa, Abu Bakr ibn\r\n    al-Mundhir and Ibn Khuzaymah thought that it (eating camel meat) breaks wudoo&#146;; this\r\n    was also the view favoured by al-Haafiz Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi. It was reported from the\r\n    scholars of hadeeth and from a group of the Sahaabah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>They took as evidence the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn Samurah which was\r\n    narrated by Muslim.

This\r\n    view has stronger evidence even though the majority follow the opposite.&#148;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The majority responded to this with the hadeeth of Jaabir: the last of\r\n    the two commands from the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    was that there was no need to do wudoo&#146; after eating meat that had been touched by\r\n    fire. But this hadeeth is general, whereas the hadeeth about doing wudoo&#146; after\r\n    eating camel meat is specific, and a specific ruling takes precedence over a general one.

Whoever claims something that is contrary to the basic \r\n    principle has to provide evidence, but it is proven that man is taahir by \r\n    the shar&rsquo;i evidence, and whatever is proven by the shar&rsquo;i evidence cannot be \r\n    altered except by further shar&rsquo;i evidence.

Those who think that bleeding breaks wudoo&rsquo; quote as evidence the hadeeth\r\n    of Abu&rsquo;l-Darda&rsquo; (may Allaah be pleased with him): &ldquo;The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) vomited, then did wudoo&rsquo;.&rdquo; They drew an\r\n    analogy between vomit and blood, because both are naajis (impure) when they come out of\r\n    the body. <\/p>\r\n    <p>This hadeeth was narrated by Ahmad (4\/449), Abu Dawood (2981) and\r\n    al-Tirmidhi (87), who said: &ldquo;More than one of the scholars among the Companions of\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others among the\r\n    Taabi&rsquo;een thought that wudoo&rsquo; should be done after vomiting or having a\r\n    nosebleed. This is the opinion of Sufyaan al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ahmad and Ishaaq.\r\n    Some scholars said that wudoo&rsquo; is not necessary after vomiting or having a nosebleed.\r\n    This is the opinion of Maalik and al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.&rdquo; This was also narrated as being\r\n    the opinion of Ahmad. Al-Baghawi said: It is the opinion of most of the Sahaabah and\r\n    Taabi&rsquo;een.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The most correct view is that bleeding does not break one&rsquo;s\r\n    wudoo&rsquo;, although it is preferable (mustahabb) to make wudoo&rsquo; after bleeding. The\r\n    evidence for this is as follows: <\/p>\r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li><p>Wudoo&rsquo; is considered to be valid until there is proof that\r\n        something breaks it. There is no proof narrated from the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n        of Allaah be upon him) that bleeding breaks wudoo&rsquo;, hence Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allaah\r\n        have mercy on him) said, &ldquo;There is no proof whatsoever that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\n        and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made it obligatory to do wudoo&rsquo; because of that\r\n        (bleeding).&rdquo; Shaykh Ibn Sa&rsquo;di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, the correct\r\n        opinion is that bleeding and vomiting, etc., do not break wudoo&rsquo;, whether they are\r\n        large or small in volume, because there is no evidence to proof that they break\r\n        wudoo&rsquo;, and the guiding principle is that wudoo&rsquo; remains valid. <\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>One cannot draw an analogy between blood and anything else, because the\r\n        reasons behind them are not the same.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The idea that bleeding breaks wudoo&rsquo; is contrary to what was\r\n        reported from the salaf (early generations), for example, &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may\r\n        Allaah be pleased with him) continued to pray although his wound was pouring with blood.\r\n        Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, &ldquo;The Muslims continue to pray\r\n        even when they are wounded.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>The fact that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n        him) did wudoo&rsquo; after he vomited does not indicate that it is obligatory to do so,\r\n        because the rules of fiqh say that the mere fact that he did something, unless it was\r\n        accompanied by a command to do it, does not make it obligatory.

In the event of this \r\n    uncertainty, the basic principle is that the prayers that were done \r\n    previously are valid. The basic principle according to the scholars in this \r\n    case is that if uncertainty arises after finishing an act of worship &ndash; was \r\n    it valid or not? &ndash; no attention should be paid to this uncertainty and the \r\n    Muslim should proceed on the basis of this principle, which is that an act \r\n    of worship remains valid until one is certain that it has been invalidated.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person prays in a state of impurity because he was \r\n    unaware of its presence, or he was aware but then forgot, his prayer is \r\n    valid according to the correct opinion.

He has to repeat the prayer according to the author&rsquo;s view, because \r\n    he annulled one of the conditions of prayer, which is avoidance of impurity, \r\n    so it is as if he prayed having broken his wudoo&rsquo; and having forgotten that \r\n    he had done so.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is also like one who forgot to wash it off.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The more correct view in all these cases is that he does not \r\n    have to repeat it, whether he forgot it, or he forgot to wash it, or he was \r\n    unaware that it had gotten onto him, or he was unaware that it was an \r\n    impurity, or he was unaware of the ruling on it, or he was unaware that it \r\n    happened before the prayer, or after the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence for that is the important general principle that \r\n    Allaah set out for His slaves, as in the verse (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope.

It is also \r\n    closer to the apparent meaning of the evidence, because the Prophet \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;There is no wudoo&rsquo; unless \r\n    there is a sound or a smell.&rdquo; Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 74; he said: a hasan \r\n    saheeh hadeeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This hadeeth and similar hadeeths on this topic were quoted \r\n    as evidence by Imam Ibn al-Mubaarak and others to show that wudoo&rsquo; is \r\n    rendered invalid by emission of wind from the back passage.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Imam at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of the scholars, that he does not have to do \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; except if he breaks wind and hears a sound or notices a smell. \r\n    &lsquo;Abdullah ibn al-Mubaarak said: If he is uncertain as to whether he has \r\n    broken wind, he does not have to do wudoo&rsquo; unless he is so certain that he \r\n    would swear to it. And he said: If wind is emitted from a woman&rsquo;s front \r\n    passage, she has to do wudoo&rsquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is also the view of ash-Shaafa&lsquo;i and Ishaaq.

It is known that wind emitted from the back passage invalidates \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; according to scholarly consensus. If the source of the wind is \r\n    uncertain &ndash; is it from the back passage, which invalidates wudoo&rsquo; according \r\n    to scholarly consensus, or is it from the front passage, which invalidates \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; according to many of the scholars? &ndash; the view that it does invalidate \r\n    wudoo&rsquo; becomes very strong, especially since the basic principle concerning \r\n    wind is that it comes from the back passage. As for that which is emitted \r\n    from the front passage, it is rare and is not a regular occurrence; this is \r\n    the basis on which those who said that it does not invalidate wudoo&rsquo; based \r\n    their opinion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this wind is continual and happens in all situations, then \r\n    this woman comes under the heading of those who are excused, even if she is \r\n    certain that it comes from the back passage. So she should do wudoo&rsquo; for \r\n    each prayer after the time for it has begun, then offer the obligatory \r\n    prayer and whatever she wants of naafil (supererogatory) prayers, and she \r\n    does not have to repeat wudoo&rsquo; every time she passes wind.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh ash-Shanqeeti (may Allah preserve him) was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The wind that comes out of a woman&rsquo;s front passage happens a \r\n    great deal at different times; should she do wudoo&rsquo; for each prayer?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    There is a well-known difference of opinion among the \r\n    scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) concerning this issue: does the \r\n    front passage come under the same ruling as the back passage with regard to \r\n    emission of wind? Some of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said \r\n    that emission of wind from the front passage comes under the same ruling as \r\n    emission of wind from the back passage. This is by way of judging like by \r\n    like; it is a strong opinion and is undoubtedly more on the safe side.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if it happens with a woman in a way that it is out of \r\n    control, or it causes her hardship and difficulty, in that case she comes \r\n    under the same ruling as the woman who is suffering from istihaadah \r\n    (irregular non-menstrual bleeding), such as when her bleeding is persistent. \r\n    She should do wudoo&rsquo; when the time for each prayer begins, and after that it \r\n    will not matter if she passes wind. The same also applies if she continually \r\n    passes wind from the back passage. It is more appropriate to be on the safe \r\n    side concerning her religious commitment and worship.

If a person is out in an open space and cannot find anything to conceal him\r\n        when he needs to answer the call of nature, he should move far away from the other people\r\n        around him, because al-Mugheerah ibn Shu&#146;bah said: &#147;I was with the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a journey, when he felt the need to answer\r\n        the call of nature, so he went far away.&#148; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 20; he said it is\r\n        a saheeh hasan hadeeth). &#145;Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Quraad said: &#147;I went out with the\r\n        Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to an open space, and\r\n        when he needed to answer the call of nature, he moved away.&#148; (Reported by\r\n        al-Nisaa&#146;i, 16; see also <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 4651) <\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>A person should not uncover his &#145;awrah (private parts) until after\r\n        he has squatted close to the ground, because this is more concealing, as Anas (may Allaah\r\n        be pleased with him) reported: &#147;When the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n        be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature, he would not lift his garment until he\r\n        had squatted close to the ground.&#148; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 14; see also <i>Saheeh\r\n        al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 4652). If a person is in a (modern) toilet, he should not lift his\r\n        garment until he has closed the door and is out of sight of other people. With regard to\r\n        this point and the one before, it is worth noting that the habit of many people in the\r\n        West and elsewhere, of urinating in a standing position in front of other people in public\r\n        toilets (using urinals) is something which goes against good manners, modesty and decency,\r\n        and is repulsive to anyone who possesses sound common sense and wisdom. How can anybody\r\n        uncover in front of other people the &#145;awrah (private parts) which Allaah has placed\r\n        between his legs to conceal it and commanded him to cover it? The idea that it should be\r\n        covered is well established among all wise and decent people of all races. It is wrong in\r\n        principle to build restrooms of this shameful type, where the users can see one another,\r\n        thus making them worse than some kinds of animals whose habit is to conceal themselves\r\n        from one another when urinating or defecating.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>It is also good manners according to Sharee&#146;ah to recite certain\r\n        adhkaar (supplications) when entering or leaving the toilet, which are quite appropriate\r\n        to the situation and place. Our Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n        taught us that when entering the toilet, we should say: &#147;<i>Allaahumma innee\r\n        a&#146;oodhi bika min al-khubthi wa&#146;l-khabaa&#146;ith<\/i> (O Allah, I seek refuge\r\n        with You from male and female devils).&#148; When leaving the toilet, he should say:\r\n        &#147;<i>Ghufraanak<\/i> (I seek Your forgiveness).&#148;<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>He should be careful to remove all impurity after answering the call of\r\n        nature, because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned\r\n        against being careless in cleaning oneself after urinating: &#147;Most of the punishment\r\n        of the grave will be because of urine.&#148; (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 342; see also <i>Saheeh\r\n        al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 1202). Ibn &#145;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both)\r\n        reported that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n        passed by two graves, and said: &#147;They are being punished, but they are not being\r\n        punished for any major sin. One of them used not to protect himself (i.e. keep himself\r\n        clean from) his urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious gossip.&#148;\r\n        (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5592).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>Any impurity should be washed or wiped three times or an odd number of\r\n        times greater than three, according to whatever is needed to cleanse it, because\r\n        &#145;Aa&#146;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace\r\n        and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to wash his posterior three times. Ibn\r\n        &#145;Umar said: &#147;We did this too and found it to be healing and cleansing.&#148;\r\n        (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 350; see also <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 4993). Abu Hurayrah\r\n        (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n        Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;When anyone of you cleans himself (with stones or similar\r\n        material) let him use an odd number.&#148; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; classed as hasan in <i>Saheeh\r\n        al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 375).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>He should not use bones or dung to clean himself or wipe away the\r\n        impurity, rather, he should use tissue, stones, and the like. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be\r\n        pleased with him) reported that he used to carry a vessel for the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) to do wudoo&#146; and clean himself after answering the\r\n        call of nature. Whilst he was following him, he (the Prophet) asked, &#147;Who is\r\n        that?&#148; He said: &#147;I am Abu Hurayrah.&#148; He said: &#147;Get me some stones I\r\n        can use to clean myself, but do not bring me any bones or dung.&#148; So I brought him\r\n        some stones, carrying them in the hem of my garment, and placed them by his side, then I\r\n        went away. When he had finished, I came back and asked him, &#147;What is wrong with bones\r\n        and dung?&#148; He said: &#147;They are the food of the jinn.&#148; (Reported by\r\n        al-Bukhaari, 3571).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>A person should not urinate into stagnant water, because Jaabir (may\r\n        Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n        blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade anyone to urinate into stagnant water (reported\r\n        by Muslim, 423), and because this makes the water impure and harms those who use it.<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>A person should not urinate by the roadside or in places where people\r\n        seek shade, because this is offensive to them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n\r\n        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &#147;Fear the two things that bring\r\n        curses.&#148; They asked, &#147;What are the two things that bring curses, O Messenger of\r\n        Allaah?&#148; He said: &#147;When a person relieves himself in the road where people walk\r\n        or in the place where they seek shade.&#148; (Reported by Abu Dawud, 23; see also <i>Saheeh\r\n        al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>, 110).<\/p>\r\n      <\/li>\r\n      <li><p>One should not greet a person who is answering the call of nature, or\r\n        return a greeting whilst one is answering the call of nature, out of respect to Allaah by\r\n        not mentioning His name in a dirty place. [Translator&#146;s note: the Islamic greeting is\r\n        &#147;<i>al-salaam &#145;alaykum<\/i> (peace be upon you)&#148;; one of the names of Allaah\r\n        is <i>al-Salaam<\/i> (the Peace)]. Jaabir ibn &#145;Abd-Allaah reported that a man passed\r\n        by the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst he was urinating,\r\n        and greeted him. The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n        said to him: &#147;If you see me in this state, do not greet me, because if you do, I will\r\n        not respond.&#148; (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 346; see also <i>Saheeh al-Jaami&#146;<\/i>,\r\n        575).

The companions of the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) said, &ldquo;Do not interrupt him; leave him.&rdquo; So they left him alone until he had finished urinating, then the Messenger of Allaah \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him and said to him: &ldquo;These mosques are not the place for urinating or for anything \r\n    filthy, rather they are for the remembrance of Allaah, prayer and reading Qur&rsquo;aan.&rdquo; Then he told a man to bring a bucket of water and he threw it \r\n    over (the urine).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 217; Muslim 285.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) felt a sense of pride and \r\n    protective jealousy (<i>gheerah<\/i>), so they shouted at that Bedouin and wanted to stop him and denounce him so that he would not carry on \r\n    urinating. It may be understood from this that it is not permissible to approve of an evil action, rather we must hasten to denounce the one who \r\n    is doing something wrong, but in this incident denunciation may have led to something even more harmful, and it was for that reason that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them not to do it, and he rebuked them for shouting at the Bedouin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the first issue that should be noted with regard to this question, which is that it is \r\n    haraam to relieve oneself in the mosque. That applies if a person is going to relieve himself on the floor of the mosque, but if it is going to be \r\n    in a vessel then some scholars were of the view that it is permissible if that is necessary or if it is too difficult to go out of the mosque \r\n    because one is sick etc. That appears to be the case in the situation mentioned here.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in <i>al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>(With regard to) urinating in a vessel in the mosque, some of them forbade that \r\n    and some allowed it if that is necessary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And he said elsewhere that it may be permissible if there is a need for that. He \r\n    said in <i>al-Fataawa al-Misriyyah<\/i>:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is more likely that it is permissible when necessary.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If a person needs to relieve himself then he should conceal himself so that no one \r\n    will see him and look at his private parts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas said: The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) passed by two graves and said: &ldquo;They are being punished but they are not being punished for anything that was difficult to \r\n    avoid, but it is a major sin. One of them used not to take care to avoid getting urine on his clothes, and the other used to walk around spreading \r\n    malicious gossip (nameemah).&rdquo; Then he took a green date palm leaf, cut it in two and placed one on each grave. They said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, \r\n    why did you do that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;So that their punishment might be reduced until this dries out.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 213 and 5708 &ndash; this version was narrated by him; and by \r\n    Muslim, 292.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the second issue that should be noted with regard to this question, which \r\n    is that it is essential to conceal one&rsquo;s &lsquo;awrah when relieving oneself and indeed in all situations. If the sister was keen to do this and did do \r\n    it, then there is no sin on her, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The third issue that should be noted with regard to this question is the disposal \r\n    of this urine. If she had kept it in a safe container until she took it outside the Haram, or in a place where it could not come into contact with \r\n    pure (taahir) things, that would have been better. But with what she did &ndash; which was to throw it into the place where the water of Zamzam is \r\n    disposed of &ndash; there is the fear that it may have contaminated some of the people who were there at the taps. If the urine was disposed of in such \r\n    a way that the people would not have been contaminated by it, then there is nothing wrong with this action, but the first action suggested above \r\n    is more correct, as we have mentioned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In conclusion, what this woman did is permissible because she needed to do that, \r\n    but we should take into consideration the fact that she should conceal herself when relieving herself so that her &lsquo;awrah will not become visible \r\n    and she will not annoy the people or contaminate them with this najaasah (impurity).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4791","question_id":"4791","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>It is known that the jinn can see people, but \r\n    people cannot see the jinn.

So he should eat and \r\n    then go to the mosque, and if he catches up with the congregation that is fine , otherwise there is no blame on him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But this should not become a habit whereby \r\n    his food is only prepared at the time of prayer, because this means that he is determined not to pray in congregation.

The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may \r\n    Allaah be pleased with him) who said that when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said the salaam after two rak&rsquo;ahs in one of \r\n    the two afternoon prayers, either Zuhr or &lsquo;Asr, and they told him about \r\n    that, he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did the rest of \r\n    the prayer, then he said the salaam, then he prostrated twice (the \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness) after saying the salaam. Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari, 482; Muslim, 573.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Ibn Mas&rsquo;ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led them \r\n    in praying Zuhr and he prayed five rak&rsquo;ahs. When he had finished it was said \r\n    to him: &ldquo;Has something been added to the prayer?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said: &ldquo;Why are you asking that?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    They said: &ldquo;You prayed five (rak&rsquo;ahs).&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So he turned towards the qiblah and prostrated twice. \r\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4040; Muslim, 572.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><u>In the case of \r\n    omitting something<\/u>, if a person omits one of the \r\n    essential parts of the prayer, one of the following two scenarios must \r\n    apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Either he remembers it before he reaches the same point in \r\n    the following rak&rsquo;ah, so he has to go back and do that essential part of the \r\n    prayer and whatever came after it,&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or he does not remember it until he reaches the same point in \r\n    the following rak&rsquo;ah, in which case the following rak&rsquo;ah takes the place of \r\n    the one in which he omitted that essential part, and he should make up the \r\n    invalid rak&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In either of these two cases, he should do the prostration of \r\n    forgetfulness after saying the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: a man stood up after doing the first prostration \r\n    of the first rak&rsquo;ah and did not sit or do the second prostration. When he \r\n    started to recite Qur&rsquo;aan he remembers that he had not done the second \r\n    prostration or sat between the two prostrations. In that case he should go \r\n    back and sit as between the two prostrations, then prostrate, then stand up \r\n    and do whatever is left of his prayer, and do the prostration of \r\n    forgetfulness after saying the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of one who did not remember until after he reached \r\n    the same point in the following rak&rsquo;ah is a man who stood up following the \r\n    first prostration in the first rak&rsquo;ah and did not do the second prostration \r\n    or sit between the two prostrations, but he did not remember that until he \r\n    sat between the two prostrations in the second rak&rsquo;ah. In this case he \r\n    should make the second rak&rsquo;ah the first rak&rsquo;ah, and add another rak&rsquo;ah to \r\n    his prayer, then say the salaam then do the prostration of forgetfulness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Omitting an obligatory part of the prayer &ndash; such as if he \r\n    omits an obligatory part and moves on to the next part of the prayer. For \r\n    example, he forgets to say Subhaan Rabbiy al-A&rsquo;la (Glory be to my Lord Most \r\n    High) and he does not remember until he has got up from prostrating. In this \r\n    case he has omitted an obligatory part of the prayer by mistake, so he \r\n    should carry on with his prayer then do the prostration of forgetfulness \r\n    before saying the salaam, because when the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) omitted the first tashahhud he carried on with his \r\n    prayer and did not go back and repeat anything, then he did the prostration \r\n    of forgetfulness before saying the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <u>In the case of being uncertain<\/u>, \r\n    such as if a person is not sure if he has done something extra or omitted \r\n    something, e.g., he is not sure whether he has prayed three rak&rsquo;ahs or four, \r\n    one of the following two scenarios must apply:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Either he thinks that one or the other is more likely to be \r\n    case, whether it is doing more or omitting something, in which case he \r\n    should proceed on the basis of what he thinks is more likely to be the case, \r\n    complete his prayer accordingly, then do the prostration of forgetfulness \r\n    after saying the salaam;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or neither appears more likely to be the case, so he should \r\n    proceed on the basis of what is certain, namely the lesser amount, and \r\n    complete his prayer accordingly, then do the prostration of forgetfulness \r\n    before saying the salaam.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    For example: a man prays Zuhr then he is not sure whether he \r\n    is praying the third or fourth rak&rsquo;ah, but he thinks it more likely that it \r\n    is the third. So he should pray another rak&rsquo;ah, then say the salaam, then do \r\n    the prostration of forgetfulness.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>An example of when \r\n    neither seems to him more likely to be the case is when a man is praying \r\n    Zuhr and is not sure whether he is in the third rak&rsquo;ah or the fourth, and \r\n    neither seems to him more likely to be the case. In that case he should \r\n    proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is the lesser amount. So he \r\n    should regard it as the third rak&rsquo;ah, then do another rak&rsquo;ah and do the \r\n    prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salaam. Thus it becomes clear \r\n    that this should be done before the salaam if you have omitted one of the \r\n    obligatory parts of the prayer or if you are not sure how many rak&rsquo;ahs you \r\n    have done, and neither of the two choices seems more likely to be the case. \r\n    And it should be done after the salaam if you have added something extra to \r\n    the prayer or you are not certain but one of the two choices seems more \r\n    likely to be the case.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh<\/i>, 14\/14-16&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4822","question_id":"4822","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And upon you be peace and the mercy of Allaah and His \r\n    blessings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This depends on what has happened to this worshipper.

It was prescribed during the time\r\n    of the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Madeenah.\r\n    According to the hadeeth of &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd ibn Abd Rabbihi, when the Messenger\r\n    of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) decided to use a bell even though\r\n    he disliked it because it was like what the Christians used, &lsquo;there appeared to me in\r\n    a dream a man who was wearing two green garments, in whose hand was a bell. I said,\r\n    &ldquo;O slave of Allaah, will you sell that bell?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What will you do\r\n    with it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We will call the people to prayer with it.&rdquo; He said,\r\n    &ldquo;Shall I not show you something better than that?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He\r\n    said, &ldquo;Say, <i>Allaahu akbar Allaah akbar<\/i> &hellip; (to the end of the\r\n    adhaan).&rdquo; When morning came, I went to the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) and told him what I had seen. He said, &ldquo;This is a true dream,\r\n    in sha Allaah. Get up with Bilaal and tell him what you have seen, so that he can give the\r\n    call, because he has a more beautiful voice than you.&rdquo; So I got up with Bilaal and\r\n    started telling him what I had seen, and he gave the call to prayer. &lsquo;Umar ibn\r\n    al-Khattaab heard that whilst he was in his house, and he came out, dragging his cloak\r\n    behind him, saying, &ldquo;By the One Who sent you with the truth, O Messenger of Allaah, I\r\n    saw the same as he saw.&rdquo; The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;To Allaah be praise.&rdquo;&rsquo; (Narrated by Ahmad, 1588;\r\n    al-Tirmidhi, 174; Abu Dawood, 421, 430; Ibn Maajah, 698).<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is clear from this hadeeth:<\/p>\r\n    <p>That the words of the adhaan came in a dream which was seen by a great\r\n    sahaabi and approved of by our great Prophet. They were not a suggestion as you mentioned,\r\n    but a dream, and it is known that dreams are one of the seventy parts of Prophethood,\r\n    because it was stated in a hadeeth narrated by Ibn &lsquo;Umar that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Dreams are one of the seventy parts of\r\n    Prophethood.&rdquo; (Narrated by Ahmad, 4449).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Al-Bukhaari narrated a different version: &ldquo;True\r\n    dreams are one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood.&rdquo; (Narrated by\r\n    al-Bukhaari,, 6474; Muslim, 4203, 42005).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The dream here, which the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings\r\n    of Allaah be upon him) described as a true dream, came from Allaah and was not a\r\n    suggestion from a person. So it was a part of Prophethood because it was approved of by\r\n    the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and was described by him as a\r\n    true dream. If the Prophet had not approved of it, it would not have been considered a\r\n    true dream and it would not have been a part of Prophethood. The one who judged it to be\r\n    true was the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the one who\r\n    commanded them to act upon it was the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him), who received revelation (wahy) from his Lord.<\/p>\r\n    <p>&lsquo;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) had seen a similar dream.\r\n    Let us not forget that &lsquo;Umar was one of the Rightly-guided khaleefahs\r\n    (al-khulafaa&rsquo; al-raashidoon), of whom the Messenger <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) said, &ldquo;I exhort you to adhere to my sunnah (way) and the sunnah of the\r\n    rightly-guided khaleefahs. Hold on tight to it with your back teeth.&rdquo; (Narrated\r\n    by al-Tirmidhi, 2600; Ibn Maajah, 43; Ahmad, 16519).<\/p>\r\n    <p>&lsquo;Umar&rsquo;s view frequently coincided with the\r\n    wahy and divine legislation. &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah reported that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, &ldquo;Among the nations who came before you\r\n    there were people who were muhaddathoon (inspired). If there is anyone like this in my\r\n    ummah, it is &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3282;\r\n    Muslim, 2398). Ibn Wahb said muhaddathoon means inspired.<\/p>\r\n    <p>You may ask, why did the adhaan start in this fashion, being seen in a\r\n    dream by two sahaabis then being confirmed by the wahy? Why was it not revealed directly?\r\n    The answer is that Allaah decrees whatever He wills, however He wills, may He be glorified\r\n    and exalted. Perhaps the way it happened was meant to demonstrate the virtue of these two\r\n    sahaabis and to confirm the how good this ummah is, because among them are some whose\r\n    opinions coincide with the wahy and some who had true dreams which confirmed their\r\n    truthfulness, for the people who have the truest dreams are the truest in speech as the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Finally:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The definition of the Sunnah given in the books of the scholars is that\r\n    it consists of everything that was narrated from the Messenger <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of\r\n    Allaah be upon him), everything that he &ldquo;said, did or approved of.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>What is meant by his words and actions is clear. What he approved of\r\n    refers to when someone did something in front of him and he approved of it &ndash; this is\r\n    also part of the sharee&rsquo;ah, not because that person did it, but because the Messenger\r\n<img>\r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of it. The Messenger <img>\r\n (peace and\r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) never kept quiet about falsehood and he never approved of\r\n    anything false or misguided that was done by others. He would disapprove of it and speak\r\n    out against it, as he did in the case of the sahaabi Abu Israa&rsquo;eel, as was narrated\r\n    by Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas, who said: &ldquo;Whilst the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) was giving a khutbah, he saw a man standing in the sun, and he asked about him.\r\n    They said, &lsquo;That is Abu Israa&rsquo;eel. He vowed to stand and not sit down, not to\r\n    seek shade, not to speak, and to fast.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Tell him to speak, seek shade\r\n    and sit down, but let him complete his fast.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari,\r\n    6326).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\r\n    approved of Abu Israa&rsquo;eel&rsquo;s vow to fast, but he cancelled the rest of his vow\r\n    and did not approve of it.<\/p>\r\n    <p>So it is clear that the adhaan became part of the religion when the\r\n    Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) confirmed what Allaah had shown the\r\n    two sahaabis in their dreams, and commanded &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd to teach it to\r\n    Bilaal so that he could call the people to prayer. Hopefully the explanation given above\r\n    will dispel your confusion and make matters clearer to you. We ask Allaah to grant us and\r\n    you understanding of Islam.

Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;We know of no \r\n    difference between the scholars (on this point).&quot; (Al-Mughni \r\n    ma&rsquo;a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1\/438). <\/li>\r\n  <li>All of the woman&rsquo;s body is &lsquo;awrah \r\n    and must be covered during prayer, except for her face, because the Prophet \r\n    <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &quot;No prayer will be accepted from an adult woman unless she wears a khimaar \r\n    (head-cover). (Reported by the five Muhadditheen) \r\n    There is some dispute as to whether her heels and feet should be covered. \r\n    The author of al-Mughni (2\/328) said: &quot;As for the rest of the free woman&rsquo;s \r\n    body, it must be covered during prayer. If any part becomes uncovered, it \r\n    renders her prayer invalid, except if only a little bit is uncovered.

This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory. <\/li>\r\n<li>This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the \r\nsalat of fear ordered in this verse. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>Second Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>Our Lord the Exalted has said in S68 V42-43 what may be translated as <em>&quot;The day that a \r\nShin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not \r\nbe able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had \r\nbeen summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had \r\nrefused.)&quot; <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>The evidence here is from several facets amongst them: <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Allah SWT punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate. <\/li>\r\n<li>The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by \r\nthe hadeeth of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet <img>\r\n told him <em>&quot;do you hear Hayya \r\nAlassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)&quot;<\/em>? He said yes, then the \r\nprophet <img>\r\n said <em>&quot;fahayhala&quot;<\/em> which means something like <em>&quot;then go answer the \r\ncall.&quot;<\/em> This hadeeth is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by \r\nAbu Dawood and Ahmad. <\/li>\r\n<li>So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>Third Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>Allah ta'aala said in S2 V43 what might be translated as <em>&quot;Establish salat and pay your \r\nzakat and bow with those that are bowing&quot;<\/em>. <\/p>\r\n<p>The proof therein is: <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>That Allah SWT ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the \r\nsalat. <\/li>\r\n<li>His, SWT, statement which was translated as <em>&quot;with those that are bowing&quot;<\/em> is an \r\norder to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except \r\nthrough congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because \r\nthe meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h5>B- Evidence From The Sunnah <\/h5>\r\n<p><strong>First Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>Abu Huraira R.A.A. narrated that the Messenger of Allah <img>\r\n said <em>&quot;The heaviest salat for \r\nthe hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would \r\nhave attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the \r\nsalat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go \r\nwith some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn \r\ntheir houses on them.&quot;<\/em> Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's \r\nversion. <\/p>\r\n<p>This hadeeth proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be \r\nburned for leaving a sunnah. <\/p>\r\n<p>Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses \r\nwith regards to this hadeeth which follow: <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah \r\n(Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadeeth of Abdullah Bin \r\nMas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet <img>\r\n said to a people that miss the \r\nFriday prayer <em>&quot;I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I \r\nwould burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer&quot;<\/em>. This is not in \r\ncontradiction to the hadeeth of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the \r\nburning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the \r\nburning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between \r\nthe two because the hadeeth of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it \r\nis likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning. <\/li>\r\n<li>They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has \r\nbeen abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation \r\nwithout evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge. <\/li>\r\n<li>They say: Ths prophet <img>\r\n wanted to burn their houses because they were \r\nhypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best \r\nrebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon \r\nhim in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of \r\ntheir hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors: <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>The first<\/strong>: cancelling what the Messenger <img>\r\n confirmed and related to missing \r\nthe congregation.<br>\r\n<strong>The second<\/strong>: Confirming what the Messenger <img>\r\n cancelled. For he never \r\npunished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept \r\nfrom them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them \r\nand Allah. <\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>As such the hadeeth of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the \r\nobligation of salat al jama'ah. <\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Second Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, <em>&quot;Oh Messenger of Allah, I do \r\nnot have someone to guide me to the Mosque,&quot;<\/em> and thus asked the Messenger <img>\r\n to \r\ngrant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, \r\nthe Messenger called him and said <em>&quot;Do you hear the call? &quot;<\/em>, he said &quot;yes&quot;. He <img>\r\n said, \r\n<em>&quot;Then answer.&quot;<\/em> Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by \r\nIbn Maktoom that he said: <em>&quot;Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have \r\na guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?&quot;<\/em> He said \r\n<em>&quot;Do you hear the call?&quot;<\/em> Ibn Maktoom replied &quot;Yes&quot;. The Prophet <img>\r\n then said <em>&quot;I \r\ncannot find an excuse for you&quot;<\/em>. If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in \r\ncongregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see? <\/p>\r\n<p>Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, &quot;This is an order to pray in \r\ncongregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah&quot;. <\/p>\r\n<p>The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive \r\nevidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about \r\nsupportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory. <\/p>\r\n<p>If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply \r\npreference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying \r\npreference, and nothing would remain obligatory. <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Third Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the \r\nProphet <img>\r\n said, <em>&quot;Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is \r\nno salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.&quot;<\/em> This is a sound, and authentic hadeeth. <\/p>\r\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat &quot;... and mind you this chain (referring to \r\nchain of narration of the above hadeeth) is authentic.&quot; This hadeeth has been narrated \r\nby Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also \r\nbeen traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, \r\nIbn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken \r\nabout this hadeeth, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic \r\nword mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to \r\nthe Prophet <img>\r\n contradict their claim. <\/p>\r\n<p>That hadeeth states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and \r\nthis judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order \r\nwhich implies preference, and not obligation. <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Fourth Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then \r\nlet him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda \r\n(guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to \r\nestablish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be \r\nabandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of \r\nyour prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that \r\npurifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these \r\nmosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), \r\nand raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, \r\nwhere not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a \r\nhypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would \r\nbe carried between two men until he is stood in the row. <\/p>\r\n<p>In another narration he said, &quot;the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and \r\namongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called&quot;. Narrated by \r\nMuslim. <\/p>\r\n<p>The evidence in this hadeeth is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of \r\nconfirmed hypocrisy. <\/p>\r\n<p>It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is \r\nobligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in \r\nwhose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites \r\nin their attributes. <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Fifth Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah <img>\r\n said, <em>&quot;If there are three \r\nlet one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is \r\nthe one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount \r\nmemorized, and ability to recite it properly)&quot;<\/em>.<\/li>\r\n<li>Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah <img>\r\n said <em>&quot;There are not three in a \r\ntown where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established \r\namongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to \r\njama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one&quot;<\/em>. Authentic hadeeth narrated by Abu \r\nDawood and Ahmed. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>Sixth Evidence<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the \r\nMu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got \r\nup from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the \r\nMasjid. Then Abu Huraira said &quot;as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the \r\nMessenger) <img>\r\n&quot;. Narrated by Muslim. <\/p>\r\n<p>Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal \r\nQasim <img>\r\n, and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of \r\nthe sunnah of Abal Qasim <img>\r\n. And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then \r\nhe has left something which is obligatory. <\/p>\r\n<p>These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim \r\nservant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will \r\nfind more and more. <\/p>\r\n<p>Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah \r\nis obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to \r\nreject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled \r\ndifferently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded \r\ndifferently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear \r\nevidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and \r\nSunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become \r\nImam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah. <\/p>\r\n<p>Know this because it is beneficial to you... <\/p>\r\n<p>Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the \r\ncompanions of the Messenger <img>\r\n, have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no \r\nnarrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. \r\nAnd following is what has been confirmed by them: <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ibn Mas'ood said, &quot;and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind \r\nexcept for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known.&quot; (5th evidence) <\/li>\r\n<li>Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have \r\nstated, &quot;Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for \r\nhim unless he has a valid excuse.&quot; (3rd evidence) <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: &quot;These are \r\nstatements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is \r\nnot one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of \r\nthese pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one \r\nanother. Verily in Allah is our success.&quot; <\/p>\r\n<p>These are the statements of the people of knowledge: <\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3\/349), &quot;More than one of the companions \r\nwere of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is \r\nno salat for him.&quot; <\/li>\r\n<li>Ata'a bin Rabah said, &quot;There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or \r\ncountry side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.&quot; <\/li>\r\n<li>Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &quot;If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in \r\ncongregation, out of pity, he should not obey her. <\/li>\r\n<li>Al-Awza'i said: &quot;There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or \r\nthe daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer \r\nor not.&quot;<\/li>\r\n<li>Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, \r\nAl-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and \r\nmost of Ahl Al-Hadeeth, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning \r\nthe obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as \r\nsuch from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.) <\/p>\r\n<p>Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is \r\ncorrect; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the \r\nacceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of \r\nZaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not. <\/p>\r\n<p>We ask Allaah to help us in remembering and thanking him and better worshipping \r\nhim.

In such a situation, the Muslim should \r\n  pray in the best way that he can, even if he is sitting in his seat and even \r\n  if he is not facing the qiblah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \r\n  &quot;<em>So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can&#133;<\/em>&quot; \r\n  [al-Taghaabun 64:16], and because the Prophet <img> (peace \r\n  and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If I have commanded you to \r\n  do something, do as much of it as you can.&quot; (Reported \r\n  by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 7288)<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  An exception to be above is naafil (supererogatory) prayers offered when riding \r\n  a camel, which is permissible even if one cannot get down or if one is not facing \r\n  the qiblah. This is known from the report of Ibn 'Umar, who said: &quot;The \r\n  Prophet <img> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n  him) used to pray when travelling on his camel, no matter which direction it \r\n  was facing, and he would gesture with his head to indicate the movements of \r\n  the night prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray witr \r\n  on his camel too.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 945)<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Prophet <img> \r\n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray voluntary (nafl) prayers \r\n  when riding on his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, when he came \r\n  from Makkah to Madeenah.&quot; Then Ibn 'Umar recited this aayah (interpretation \r\n  of the meaning): &quot;<em>And to Allaah belong the east and the west, so wherever \r\n  you turn yourselves or your faces, there is the Face of Allaah (and He is High \r\n  above, over His Throne)&#133;<\/em>&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:115] <\/p>\r\n<p>Ibn 'Umar said: &quot;It \r\n  was concerning this that this aayah was revealed.&quot; (Reported \r\n  by al-Tirmidhi, 2883; he said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth)<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  We should not forget to point out here that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries \r\n  sometimes delay or abandon their prayers for another, completely different, \r\n  reason, which is that they feel too embarrassed to pray in front of the kuffaar \r\n  in public or open places, or they are afraid that they will make fun of them \r\n  and regard them as odd. This is a serious mistake. How can a Muslim feel embarrassed \r\n  about proclaiming the truth and worshipping openly, hastening to fulfil the \r\n  command of Allaah at the time when Allaah has said it is to be done?

An old man may become confused and unable to distinguish \r\n    things, which may mean that he is no longer accountable, but he is not \r\n    described as insane, because an insane person may be treated whereas a \r\n    senile person cannot be treated. Hence it does not say in the hadeeth &ldquo;until \r\n    he recovers&rdquo;, because in most cases he cannot recover from it, until he \r\n    dies.

End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    explained that senility means that one is no longer accountable: Fasting is \r\n    not obligatory unless certain conditions are met: one, being of sound mind; \r\n    two, being an adult; three, being Muslim; four, being able to do it; five, \r\n    not being a traveller; six, being free of menses and postpartum bleeding \r\n    (nifaas) in the case of women.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Being of sound mind, the opposite of which is having lost \r\n    one&rsquo;s mind, whether that is due to insanity or senility, i.e., old age, or \r\n    because of an accident which has caused one to lose one&rsquo;s mind and sense of \r\n    awareness. Such a person is not obliged to do anything because he has lost \r\n    his mind. Based on this, the old man who has reached the stage of senility \r\n    is not obliged to fast or feed poor persons instead, because he lost all \r\n    sense of reason.

If that is not possible then she may pray sitting and \r\n    intending in her heart to bow and prostrate, whilst facing the qiblah. If \r\n    she is unable to face the qiblah, then she may pray facing in any direction. \r\n    If we assume that she can only pray whilst lying down, then she may do that. \r\n    The point is that prayer is not waived for one who is accountable under any \r\n    circumstances.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The basic principle \r\n    concerning that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the \r\n    meaning): <i>&ldquo;Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope&rdquo; [al-Baqarah \r\n    2:286]<\/i> and the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him): &ldquo;Pray standing, and if you cannot then sitting, and if you \r\n    cannot then on your side.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1117) and Abu Dawood \r\n    (952).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The fuqaha&rsquo; mentioned some \r\n    cases in which the requirement to face the qiblah and bow and prostrate is \r\n    waived, such as when fleeing from a wild animal or a flood or when fighting \r\n    breaks out on the battlefield, when there is not enough time to do the \r\n    prayer properly with all its essential parts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Mughni<\/i> (1\/258): To sum up: if the fear \r\n    is so intense that one cannot pray facing the qiblah or one needs to walk or \r\n    is unable to do some of the essential parts of prayer, either because of \r\n    permissible flight from an enemy, flood, wild beast or fire and the like, \r\n    which one can only escape by fleeing, or when engaging in fighting the enemy \r\n    or when fighting breaks out on the battlefield, and there is a need to \r\n    charge and retreat and stab and strike and chase, then he may pray according \r\n    to his situation, whether he is walking or riding, facing the qiblah if \r\n    possible, or facing any other direction if that is not possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>If he is unable to bow and \r\n    prostrate, he may gesture to indicate them, and lean forward more for \r\n    prostration than bowing, according to what he is able to do.

If he needs to stab and strike and charge and retreat, \r\n    he may do that. He should not delay the prayer until the time for it is over \r\n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>&ldquo;And if you fear (an \r\n    enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on foot or riding&rdquo; [al-Baqarah 2:239]<\/i>. And \r\n    Maalik narrated from Naafi&rsquo; that Ibn &lsquo;Umar said: If the fear is greater than \r\n    that, they may pray walking, standing on their feet, or riding, facing the \r\n    qiblah or otherwise. Naafi&rsquo; said: I do not think that Ibn &lsquo;Umar narrated it \r\n    from anyone but the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him).

If a prisoner fears for his life if he prays, or if \r\n    someone is hiding in a place, then they should pray however they are able \r\n    to. This was stated by Ahmad with regard to the prisoner. If the one who is \r\n    hiding is sitting and cannot stand, or he is lying down and cannot stand up \r\n    or move, then he should pray according to his situation. This is the view of \r\n    Muhammad ibn al-Hasan. Al-Shaafa&rsquo;i said: He should pray and repeat it (later \r\n    on), but this is not correct, because the one who is afraid should pray \r\n    according to what he is able to do, and he does not have to repeat it, as is \r\n    also the case for one who is fleeing. It makes no difference whether one is \r\n    travelling or not, because what makes it permissible is fear of death, and \r\n    that is the same in both cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Whenever he can find a \r\n    refuge to do his prayer, such as if the one who is fleeing from a flood can \r\n    climb to a high place and the one who fears an enemy can enter a fortress \r\n    where he will be safe from the enemy&rsquo;s attack and from harm, then he should \r\n    pray there then come out, and he does not have the right to offer the prayer \r\n    of extreme fear, because that is only permitted in cases of necessity, so it \r\n    is only to be done when necessary.

According to the view that takbeer is obligatory, he has invalidated \r\n    his prayer if he did that deliberately, and if he did it by mistake he must \r\n    perform the prostration of forgetfulness (sujood al-sahw).

There is no scholarly \r\n    difference of opinion on this matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But if he \r\n    starts it before that or ends it after that, and some of it happens outside \r\n    the proper place, then this is like not doing it at all, because he did not \r\n    complete it at the right time. It is like one who completes his recitation \r\n    whilst bowing, or who starts to recite the tashahhud before sitting.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>But he may \r\n    be forgiven for that, because avoiding it is difficult, and mistakes are \r\n    often made, and it is too harsh to suggest that this invalidates the prayer \r\n    or requires the prostration of forgetfulness.

Reciting out loud is general and applies to every dhikr that is \r\n    prescribed after prayer, whether it is tahleel (saying <i>Laa ilaaha \r\n    ill-Allaah<\/i> (there is no god but Allaah), tasbeeh (saying <i>Subhaan \r\n    Allaah <\/i>(Glory be to Allaah)), takbeer (saying <i>Allaahu akbar<\/i> \r\n    (Allaah is Most Great)) or tahmeed (saying <i>Al-hamdu Lillaah<\/i> (praise \r\n    be to Allaah)), because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Abbaas. There is no report from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) to suggest differentiating between tahleel and other \r\n    dhikrs, rather in the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas it says that they would know \r\n    that the prayer of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) had ended from the takbeers. Thus the view of those who say that the \r\n    voice should not be raised in tasbeeh, tahmeed and takbeer is refuted.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to those who say that raising the voice in these \r\n    dhikrs is an innovation (bid&rsquo;ah), they are wrong. How can something that was \r\n    known and practised at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) be a bid&rsquo;ah? Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn Sahmaan (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) said: It has been proven that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that and approved of it, and the \r\n    Sahaabah used to do that at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he taught it to them, and he approved \r\n    of them doing it, so they acted upon the teachings of the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); they did it and he approved of \r\n    that after teaching them and he did not criticize them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the argument that reciting out loud is disapproved \r\n    because of the verse <i>&ldquo;And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and \r\n    with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings and in the \r\n    afternoons&rdquo; [al-A&rsquo;raaf 7:205]<\/i>, we say: the one who was enjoined to \r\n    remember his Lord within himself, humbly and with fear, was the same one who \r\n    used to recite dhikr out loud following obligatory prayers. Does the one who \r\n    says this know better what Allaah meant than His Messenger did?&nbsp; Or does he \r\n    believe that the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    knew what was meant but went against it? Moreover, the verse speaks of dhikr \r\n    at the beginning and end of the day (&ldquo;<i>in the mornings and in the \r\n    afternoons<\/i>&rdquo;), not the dhikr that is prescribed following prayers. In his \r\n    Tafseer, Ibn Katheer interpreted reciting out loud as meaning too loud or \r\n    extremely loud. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the argument that reciting out loud is disapproved \r\n    because of the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him): &ldquo;O people, take it easy&rdquo;, the one who said &ldquo;O people, take it \r\n    easy&rdquo; is the same one who used to recite dhikr out loud following the \r\n    prescribed prayers. There is a place for this and a place for that, and \r\n    truly following means following every text when appropriate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Moreover, the context of the phrase &ldquo;take it easy&rdquo; indicates \r\n    that they used to raise their voices in a manner that caused them hardship, \r\n    hence he said &ldquo;take it easy&rdquo;, i.e., be kind to yourselves and do not exhaust \r\n    yourselves; there should be no hardship or undue effort in reciting dhikr \r\n    out loud.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the one who says that it disturbs others, it may be \r\n    said to him: If you mean that it disturbs those who do not have the habit of \r\n    doing that, once the believer understands that it is Sunnah, it will no \r\n    longer disturb him. If you mean that it disturbs other worshippers, then if \r\n    there is no one among the worshippers who joined the prayer late and is \r\n    making up what he missed, then the raising of voices will not disturb them \r\n    at all, which is what actually happens, because they are all taking part in \r\n    it. But if there is someone among them who joined the prayer late and is \r\n    making up what he missed, if he is so close to you that you will be \r\n    disturbing him, then you should not recite so loudly as to disturb him, so \r\n    that he will not become confused in his prayer, but if he is far away from \r\n    you then he will not be disturbed by your reciting out loud.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From what we have mentioned it is clear that the Sunnah is to \r\n    raise the voice in dhikr following the obligatory prayers, and that does not \r\n    go against any saheeh text or sound opinion. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also said: When voices are mingled with one another then \r\n    there will be no disturbance, as you can see on Fridays when the people all \r\n    read Qur&rsquo;aan out loud, then someone comes and prays and he is not disturbed \r\n    by that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What matters is \r\n    the correct view, which is that it is Sunnah to recite dhikr following the \r\n    prayers in the manner prescribed, and it is also Sunnah to recite it out \r\n    loud but not to raise the voice so much that it becomes annoying, because \r\n    that is not appropriate. Hence when the people raised their voices in dhikr \r\n    at the time of the Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) when they were coming back from Khaybar, he said: &ldquo;O people, take it \r\n    easy.&rdquo; What is meant by raising the voice is that which does not cause \r\n    hardship or annoyance. End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> (13\/247, 261).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    From what we have mentioned above it is clear that the matter \r\n    is broad in scope, and that the difference of opinion is an ancient matter. \r\n    Perhaps the correct view is that which was mentioned by the Shaykh (may \r\n    Allaah have mercy on him) about raising the voice, but it should be raised \r\n    in a manner that does not cause annoyance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What I mentioned about uneducated people and the elderly, I \r\n    will repeat it once again. It may be appropriate to read the words of the \r\n    Shaykh to them so that they may learn the Sunnah and be encouraged to apply \r\n    it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which \r\n    pleases Him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4867","question_id":"4867","answers":"<p>Praise be to Allaah.<\/p>\r\n    <p>The most correct view is that it is not permissible to\r\n    pray in a room in which images of animate beings are hanging, on the basis of several\r\n    reports, including the following:<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who\r\n    said: the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The angels do\r\n    not enter a house in which there is a dog or images.&rdquo; (Agreed upon).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be\r\n    pleased with her) who said: &ldquo;The Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah\r\n    be upon him) returned from a journey and I had covered an alcove with a blanket on which\r\n    there were images. When the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\r\n    him) saw it, he tore it down and said, &lsquo;The people who will be most severely punished\r\n    on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of Allaah.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Agreed\r\n    upon).<\/p>\r\n    <p>The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with\r\n    him) who said: the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\r\n    &ldquo;Jibreel came to me and said: &lsquo;I came to you yesterday and nothing prevented me\r\n    from entering except that there was a statue by your door, and there was a curtain in your\r\n    house with images on it, and there was a dog in the house. So tell someone to cut the head\r\n    off the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to cut up the\r\n    curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on; and tell someone to put\r\n    the dog outside.&rsquo;&rdquo; So the Messenger of Allaah <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\r\n    upon him) did that. (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ahmad).<\/p>\r\n    <p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on\r\n    him) gave a brief answer to this question, when he was asked: is it permissible to pray in\r\n    synagogues and churches where there are images, or not? Can we say that they are the\r\n    houses of Allaah, or not? He replied: they are not the houses of Allaah, for the houses of\r\n    Allaah are the mosques. These (churches etc.) are houses in which people express their\r\n    disbelief (kufr) in Allaah. Even though Allaah may be mentioned in them, the house is the\r\n    same as its occupants, and their occupants are kuffaar, so they are the houses of worship\r\n    of the kuffaar.<\/p>\r\n    <p>As regards praying in them, there are three scholarly views in the\r\n    Madhhab of Ahmad and others: absolute prohibition, which is the view of Maalik; absolute\r\n    permission, which is the view of some of the companions of Ahmad; and the third view,\r\n    which is the correct view and was narrated from &lsquo;Umar ibn al-Khattaab and others, and\r\n    from Ahmad and others. This view states that if there are images in the church, we should\r\n    not pray there, because the angels do not enter a house in which there are images, and\r\n    because the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not enter the\r\n    Ka&rsquo;bah until the images inside it had been wiped out. Similarly, &lsquo;Umar said: we\r\n    do not enter their churches if there are images inside.<\/p>\r\n    <p>Churches are like mosques that are built over graves. In <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i>\r\n    it says that the Prophet <img>\r\n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was told about a\r\n    church in Ethiopia, and the adornments and images inside it. He said: &ldquo;When a\r\n    righteous man among them dies, they build a mosque (place of worship) over his grave and\r\n    put those images there. They will be the most evil of people with Allaah on the Day of\r\n    Resurrection.&rdquo; But the Sahaabah did pray in churches in which there were no images.\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Reference: Masaa&rsquo;il wa rasaa&rsquo;il, Muhammad al-Mahmoud al-Najdi, p. 28"},{"id":"4868","question_id":"4868","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Firstly: the \r\n    basic principle is that the prayer should be offered in the mosque, and this \r\n    is what the mosques were built for.

The shar&rsquo;i definition of the intention is: \r\n    &ldquo;Deciding to do an act of worship in order to draw closer to Allaah.&rdquo; This \r\n    definition includes two meanings:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The intention to do the action. This distinguishes acts \r\n    of worship from other actions, and distinguishes acts of worship from one \r\n    another. So one has the intention that these movements are the prescribed \r\n    prayer, and&nbsp; decides whether it is fard (obligatory) or naafil.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; The intention with regard to whom it is done for. This \r\n    means that by doing this action one is seeking the pleasure of Allaah and \r\n    nothing else.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The site of this intention is the heart. By simply deciding \r\n    in his heart to do this action, a person has made his intention. Hence it is \r\n    not prescribed to speak the intention out loud when one wants to do the \r\n    action. Rather speaking the intention out loud is a kind of innovation that \r\n    was not narrated in the Book of Allaah or in the Sunnah of His Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), nor was it narrated from any of \r\n    his Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them all). See <i>al-Sharh \r\n    al-Mumti&rsquo;<\/i>, 2\/283. For more information please see question no.\r\n    13337.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>With regard to what a \r\n    person should think about during the prayer, he should focus on the \r\n    greatness of his Lord before Whom he is honoured to stand. So he should \r\n    stand before Him properly, with humility and veneration. He should think \r\n    about what it is prescribed for him to say in every part of the prayer. When \r\n    he is standing he should ponder the meaning of what he is reciting from the \r\n    Qur&rsquo;aan. When bowing he should think about the meaning of the dhikr he is \r\n    reciting, and the same when prostrating and in other parts of the prayer. He \r\n    should also strive in all parts of the prayer to recite the dhikrs and \r\n    du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;s that were narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him). With regard to du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in the sense of asking Allaah for \r\n    what one needs of the good things in this world and in the Hereafter, the \r\n    time to do that is when prostrating, after reciting the prescribed dhikr, \r\n    because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \r\n    &ldquo;I have been forbidden to recite Qur&rsquo;aan when bowing and prostrating. As for \r\n    rukoo&rsquo; (bowing), glorify your Lord therein, and as for sujood (prostration), \r\n    strive in du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, for then it is more likely that your Lord will answer \r\n    you.&rdquo; (Narrated by Muslim, 738).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to what is mentioned in the question, that it is \r\n    narrated in some ahaadeeth that we have to call upon Allaah throughout the \r\n    prayer, none of the reputable scholars has mentioned this or referred to it. \r\n    Perhaps you have understood from the definition of some scholars that salaah \r\n    (prayer) means du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; (supplication), and this is the meaning that you \r\n    mentioned.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or perhaps you have heard some scholars saying that salaah is \r\n    all du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. By this they were referring to the second category of du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, \r\n    for some of the scholars divided du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; into two categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in the sense of asking, which means asking Allaah \r\n    for one&rsquo;s needs; and 2 &ndash; du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in the sense of worship, which means \r\n    worshipping Allaah in the ways that He has prescribed, by means of various \r\n    acts of worship such as prayer, fasting and zakaah. What this means is that \r\n    these acts of worship include asking from Allaah, is if one is saying, &ldquo;O \r\n    Allaah accept this from me&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reward me for this act of worship by \r\n    granting me forgiveness, admission to Paradise and salvation from Hell,&rdquo; \r\n    etc. All of prayer is considered to be du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; in this sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hence our advice to all Muslims is to adhere to the Sunnah of \r\n    the greatest of Messengers <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    throughout the prayer, following his command: &ldquo;pray as you have seen me \r\n    praying.&rdquo; (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 631). They should ponder the meanings of \r\n    what they recite from the Qur&rsquo;aan, and the dhikrs they recite, so that they \r\n    may fulfil the greater purpose of prayer which is, as Allaah explained:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah).

This \r\n    applies to all such rulings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Muslim has to accept the things for which Allaah has not \r\n    explained the reason, and say as the believers say: &ldquo;We hear and we obey.&rdquo; \r\n    He should not be like the Children of Israel who said: &ldquo;We hear but we \r\n    disobey.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Accepting what Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\n    <i>&ldquo;He [Allaah] cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be \r\n    questioned&rdquo; [al-Anbiya&rsquo; 21:23]<\/i> is better for the believer in his \r\n    religious and worldly affairs, for he is a slave who has a Lord, and the \r\n    slave has no right to ask his Lord why He enjoined something. Rather he has \r\n    to submit to His command. If he tells us why, we should do it, and if He \r\n    does not tell us why, we should still do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; In <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah<\/i> \r\n    (1\/49-51) there is a useful discussion which we will quote here:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to understanding the reasons why things have been \r\n    prescribed, we may divide the issues of fiqh into two categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; Rulings whose wisdom may be understood on a rational \r\n    basis, either because the reason is stated in the texts, or because it is \r\n    easy to work out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Such rulings are the majority of those that Allaah has \r\n    prescribed, such as enjoining prayer, zakaah, fasting and Hajj in general, \r\n    and such as enjoining the mahr (dowry) in marriage, &lsquo;iddah (waiting period) \r\n    following divorce or widowhood, spending on one&rsquo;s wife, children and \r\n    relatives, divorce when married life becomes unbearable, and many other such \r\n    issues of fiqh.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; Ruling which are enjoined on us as a kind of pure \r\n    worship. These are rulings in which the connection between the ruling and \r\n    the action is not clear, such as the number of prayers, the number of \r\n    rak&rsquo;ahs and most of the actions of Hajj. By the mercy of Allaah, such \r\n    rulings are few in relation to the rulings the wisdom behind which may be \r\n    rationally understood. These rulings are prescribed as a test to demonstrate \r\n    whether a person is a true believer. It should also be noted that sharee&rsquo;ah \r\n    &ndash; both general principles and minor details &ndash; does not prescribe anything \r\n    that contradict common sense, but it may prescribe something the reason for \r\n    which cannot be understood. There is a big difference between the two. If a \r\n    person is rationally convinced that Allaah exists and that He is wise, and \r\n    that He alone deserves to be acknowledged as Lord, and he is rationally \r\n    convinced that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    is a true Prophet, then he affirms that Allaah is the Sovereign and the \r\n    Lord, and that he is His slave. Then if he is commanded to do something or \r\n    is forbidden to do something, and he then says, &ldquo;I will not follow this \r\n    ruling until I know the reason behind this command or prohibition,&rdquo; then he \r\n    has proven himself to be false in his claim to be a believer in Allaah and \r\n    His Messenger. The human mind has a limit beyond which it cannot go.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The one who rebels against the rulings of Allaah that have to \r\n    do with rituals is like a sick person who goes to a trustworthy doctor who \r\n    prescribes various kinds of medicine for him, some to be taken before \r\n    eating, some to be taken during the meal and some to be taken afterwards, in \r\n    various amounts, and he says to the doctor: I will not take your medicine \r\n    until you explain to me the reason why this one should be taken before \r\n    eating and this one afterwards, and this one during the meal, and why are \r\n    they are varying amounts, some small and some big? Does this patient really \r\n    trust his doctor? The same may be said of a person who claims to believe in \r\n    Allaah and His Messenger, then he rebels against the rulings the wisdom \r\n    behind which he does not understand. The true believer, if he is commanded \r\n    to something or forbidden to do something, says, &ldquo;I hear and I obey,&rdquo; \r\n    especially when we have explained that there are no rulings that can be \r\n    rejected on the basis of reason. Not knowing something does not indicate \r\n    that it is not true. How many rulings are there, the reason for which has \r\n    been concealed from us in the past, then we discovered that there is great \r\n    wisdom behind them?

Indeed, one should not always \r\n    combine the two and regard them as being the same in status. Rather the \r\n    worshipper should do that sometimes and not do it sometimes, according to \r\n    the situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly dhikr and du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;s are among the best kinds of \r\n    worship. Acts of worship are based on tawqeef and following, not on whims \r\n    and desires and innovation. The du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;s and dhikrs narrated from the Prophet \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are the best that anyone can \r\n    find of dhikr and du&rsquo;aa&rsquo;, and the one who limits himself to them will be \r\n    safe and sound. The beneficial results that they bring cannot be put into \r\n    words or fully comprehended by man. Any other dhikrs may be haraam or they \r\n    may be makrooh. They may involve shirk which most people may not realize and \r\n    which would take too long to explain in detail.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    No one has the right to prescribe for people any kind of \r\n    dhikr or du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; that is not narrated in the Sunnah and make it an act of \r\n    worship that people should perform regularly as they perform the five daily \r\n    prayers regularly. Rather this is a kind of innovation in religion for which \r\n    Allaah has not given permission&hellip; As for adopting a wird that is not \r\n    prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah and dhikr that is not prescribed in sharee&lsquo;ah, this \r\n    is something that is forbidden. Moreover the du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;s and adhkaar that are \r\n    prescribed in sharee&lsquo;ah are the best and lead to achieving all aims and \r\n    goals; no one turns away from them and adopts innovated and invented adhkaar \r\n    except one who is ignorant, negligent or a wrong doer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 22\/510- 511&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    How long should Qunoot be? Is it prescribed to make it \r\n    lengthy or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If we study the hadeeth of al-Hasan ibn &lsquo;Ali quoted above, we \r\n    will find that the du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) taught him is a brief and concise du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; that only takes a few \r\n    minutes. This indicates that what is appropriate in du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; al-Qunoot is to \r\n    make it brief and to stick to concise phrases.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Mughni al-Muhtaaj<\/i>, 1\/369:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>al-Majmoo&lsquo;<\/i>, narrating from al-Baghawi: It \r\n    is makrooh to make Qunoot lengthy, like the first tashahhud. Al-Qaadi Husayn \r\n    said: If he makes Qunoot longer than is usual, that is makrooh. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In fact an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) indicated \r\n    that combining the du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \r\n    upon him) and the du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; of &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) in Qunoot \r\n    comes under the heading of making it lengthy, and one should pay attention \r\n    to the people&rsquo;s circumstances and find out whether they approve of that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He said: Our companions said: It is mustahabb to combine the \r\n    Qunoot of &lsquo;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and that which is mentioned \r\n    in the hadeeth quoted above. If they are combined, then the more correct way \r\n    is to recite the Qunoot of &lsquo;Umar second. And if he wants to keep it short, \r\n    he should limit it to what is narrated in the hadeeth. Rather it is \r\n    mustahabb to combine the two if he is praying on his own or if he is an imam \r\n    of people who approve of making it lengthy. And Allah knows best.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Majmoo&lsquo;<\/i>, 3\/478&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If combining the two du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;s mentioned, even though they are \r\n    brief, is regarded as a kind of making it lengthy, then how about what is \r\n    mentioned in your question of making it last for twenty minutes or \r\n    thereabouts? What about those who offer du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; for double that time or more, \r\n    which many imams do who do not care about anything except giving a \r\n    performance in front of people, Allah forbid? People have seen strange \r\n    things of that nature nowadays.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The best approach in all of that &ndash; and Allah knows best &ndash; is \r\n    to be moderate, for the best of affairs are those that are moderate; and \r\n    Islam forbids making things difficult for people, especially if there is a \r\n    custom of doing that every night.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen was asked the following question in <i>\r\n    Fataawa &lsquo;Ulama&rsquo; al-Balad al-Haraam<\/i> (152):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In Ramadan, some of the imams in the mosques make the du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; \r\n    long, and some make it short. Which is the correct way?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct way is not to exaggerate or to fall short. Making \r\n    it so long that it causes hardship for the people is forbidden. When the \r\n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) heard that Mu&lsquo;aadh ibn \r\n    Jabal was making the prayer very lengthy when he led his people in prayer, \r\n    he got angry in exhortation in an unprecedented manner, and he said to \r\n    Mu&lsquo;aadh ibn Jabal: &ldquo;O Mu&lsquo;aadh, do you want to put people off their \r\n    religion?&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6106; Muslim, 465.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So what should be done is adhering to the words narrated (in \r\n    hadeeth) or one may add more to that.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Undoubtedly making it very lengthy causes hardship to people \r\n    and exhausts them, especially the weak ones among them. Among the people are \r\n    those who have work ahead of them but they do not like to leave before the \r\n    imam, although it is difficult for them to stay with the imam. So my advice \r\n    to my brother imams is to adopt a moderate approach. By the same token, they \r\n    should refrain from offering du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; on occasion, so that the common folk do \r\n    not think that du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; is obligatory.

Even if it does not involve that, they \r\n    still raise their voices too much, more than is needed to convey the words, \r\n    and they focus too much on their performance of tunes to show their \r\n    proficiency in doing so, which has nothing to do with carrying out the act \r\n    of worship properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is obvious that the purpose behind this is to impress the \r\n    people. It is as if he is saying: Look at my beautiful voice and how I come \r\n    up with nice tunes, and that is wrong. I do not think that this would come \r\n    from one who really understands the meaning of prayer and worship!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If this is what he said concerning the mu&rsquo;adhdhins, then what \r\n    about the imams who do that in the prayer itself?! It is no wonder that he \r\n    commented further and said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, I think that coming up with nice tunes in du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;, \r\n    as some reciters do in our times, is not done by one who understands the \r\n    real meaning of du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; and asking of Allah. That is no more than a kind of \r\n    playing about. If you saw someone making a request of a king and he put on \r\n    this kind of performance, with his voice rising and falling as if singing, \r\n    he would be accused of mockery and fooling about, because the appropriate \r\n    way to ask is with beseeching and humility, not singing!

What is \r\n    your opinion of that?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    His reply was:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What I think is that if this is done within shar&lsquo;i limits, \r\n    without exaggerating, then there is nothing wrong with it. Hence Abu Moosa \r\n    al-Ash&lsquo;ari said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \r\n    If I had known that you were listening to my recitation, I would have \r\n    beautified it for you.&rdquo; If someone has a beautiful voice or recites in a way \r\n    that softens people&rsquo;s hearts, I do not think there is anything wrong with \r\n    that. But exaggerating with regard to that so that he does this with every \r\n    single word of the Qur&rsquo;an, as mentioned in the question &ndash; I think that this \r\n    is excessive and should not be done.

It also states in the verse that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud and the mushrikeen heard him and reviled the Qur'aan and the one who had bought it, so he was forbidden to recite out loud and he began to recite silently, but then the members of his household and those who were listening to him missed out on the benefit, so he was enjoined to recite at a moderate volume.&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him)."},{"id":"4882","question_id":"4882","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      Yes, the recording angels who write down the deeds of the \r\n      son of Adam enter houses in which there are images.

This is how it was narrated in \r\n    the hadeeth from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) and it is sounder than the opinions of the scholars.

Although the isnaad \r\n    of this hadeeth is da&rsquo;eef, it is supported by other reports and by the \r\n    general meaning of the evidence which suggests that there is no sin in that \r\n    case, because of the difficulty involved in preventing people from passing \r\n    in front of a worshipper in al-Masjid al-Haraam in most cases.

This relationship with Allah \r\n          is both demonstrated and put into practice, as well as improved and \r\n          increased, by the prayer. Therefore, if the prayers are sound and proper, \r\n          the rest of the deeds will be sound and proper; and if the prayers are \r\n          not sound and proper, then the rest of the deeds will not be sound and \r\n          proper, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself stated. <\/span><\/big><\/p>\r\n        <p><big><span>In \r\n          reality, the prayer is performed properly &ndash; with true remembrance of \r\n          Allah and turning to Him for forgiveness &ndash; it will have a lasting effect \r\n          on the person. After he finishes the prayer, his heart will be filled \r\n          with the remembrance of Allah. He will be fearful as well as hopeful \r\n          of Allah. After that experience, he will not want to move from that \r\n          lofty position to one wherein he disobeys Allah.

He said takbeer with the intention of \r\n    offering two rak&rsquo;ahs of Duha, then he remembered that he had not offered the \r\n    regular prayer of Fajr, so he changed it to the regular prayer of Fajr. This \r\n    is not valid, because the regular prayer of Fajr is two rak'ahs for which he \r\n    should have had the intention from the beginning of the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example is a man who started to pray &lsquo;Asr, but whilst \r\n    praying he remembered that he had not prayed Zuhr, so he intended this \r\n    prayer to be Zuhr. This is also not valid, because the intention for a \r\n    specific prayer must be there from the outset.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to changing from something general to something \r\n    specific, such as if a person started to offer a general (i.e., naafil) \r\n    prayer, then he remembered that he had not prayed Fajr or the Sunnah of \r\n    Fajr, so he changed his intention to Fajr prayer or the Sunnah of Fajr &ndash; \r\n    this is also not valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But if he changes from something specific to something \r\n    general, such as if he starts praying with the intention that it is the \r\n    regular prayer of Fajr, then whilst he is praying he remembers that he has \r\n    already offered this prayer, in that case he may change his original \r\n    intention to the intention to simply offer a prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another example is that of a man who starts to offer an \r\n    obligatory prayer on his own, then a group (jamaa&rsquo;ah) comes along, and he \r\n    wants to change his obligatory prayer to a naafil prayer so that he may cut \r\n    it short and offer two rak'ahs only, then offer the obligatory prayer with \r\n    the group. This is permissible, because he is changing from something \r\n    specific to something general.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the principle is:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Changing from one specific thing to another is not valid; \r\n    changing from something general to something specific is not valid; changing \r\n    from something specific to something general is valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    12\/ Question no. 347.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Shaykh was also asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is it permissible to change one&rsquo;s intention from one specific \r\n    thing to another?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied: It is not permissible to change one&rsquo;s intention \r\n    from one specific thing to another, or from something general to something \r\n    specific. Rather it is only permissible to change one's intention from \r\n    something specific to something general.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of the first, changing one's intention from one \r\n    specific thing to another, is changing the intention from praying Zuhr to \r\n    praying &lsquo;Asr. In this case the Zuhr prayer is invalidated, because one has \r\n    turned away from it, and ha has not started &lsquo;Asr prayer because that was not \r\n    the intention from the outset. In that case both prayers must be made up.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of the second, changing from something general to \r\n    something specific, is when a person starts to pray a general naafil prayer, \r\n    then turns the intention to a specific naafil prayer, then he changes it \r\n    into regular Sunnah prayer, i.e., a man starts to pray with a general \r\n    intention, then he wants to make it the regular Sunnah prayer of Zuhr &ndash; for \r\n    example. But this does not count as the regular Sunnah prayer, because he \r\n    did not have that intention from the outset.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    An example of the third, changing from something specific to \r\n    something general, is when a person intends to offer the regular Sunnah \r\n    prayer of Maghrib, then he decides to make it a general Sunnah prayer. This \r\n    is valid and does not invalidate the prayer, because the intention to \r\n    perform a specific prayer includes the intention to offer prayer in general, \r\n    so if the specific intention is cancelled out, the general intention still \r\n    remains, but if he does that, then his regular Sunnah prayer does not count \r\n    because he has turned away from it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    12\/ question no. 348.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p><span>And Allaah knows \r\n    best<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4910","question_id":"4910","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>In the answer to \r\n      question no [fatin]50684[\\fatin] we have stated \r\n      that standing is a pillar or essential part of the obligatory prayers, so \r\n      the prayer of one who prays sitting when he is able to stand is not valid. \r\n      But like all other obligatory duties, this may be waived in the case of \r\n      inability to do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said in <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (4\/201):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The ummah is unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to \r\n    stand in an obligatory prayer may pray sitting down, and he does not have to \r\n    repeat the prayer.

Slight difficulty is not sufficient (as an excuse).

However it may be divided into five \r\n      categories:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Obligatory movements<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Forbidden movements<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Makrooh movements<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Mustahabb movements<\/span><\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    5-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    <\/span><span>Permissible movements<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The obligatory movements are those on which the validity of \r\n    the prayer depends. For example if a person notices something impure on his \r\n    ghutrah (head gear), he has to move to remove it and take off his ghutrah. \r\n    That is because Jibreel came to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) when he was leading the people in prayer and told him \r\n    that there was something dirty on his shoe. So the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) took it off whilst he was praying and \r\n    carried on praying. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 650; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>al-Irwa&rsquo;<\/i>, 284.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or if someone tells him that he is not facing the qiblah, he \r\n    should move to face the qiblah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The forbidden movements \r\n    are continuous movements done for no reason, because this kind of movement \r\n    invalidates the prayer, and whatever invalidates the prayer is not \r\n    permissible, because it is like mocking the signs of Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The mustahabb movements are those done in order to do things \r\n    that are mustahabb in prayer, such as if a person moves to make the row \r\n    straight, or if he sees a gap in the row in front, so he moves forward \r\n    whilst praying, or if there is a gap in his row and he moves to fill the gap \r\n    and other such movements which allow one to do a deed that is mustahabb in \r\n    prayer, because that makes the prayer more perfect and complete. Hence when \r\n    Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) prayed with the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> \r\n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and stood to his left, the \r\n    Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took \r\n    hold of his head from behind and made him stand on his right. (Agreed \r\n    upon).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The permissible movements are small movements done when there \r\n    is a reason, or large movements done in cases of necessity. Small movements \r\n    done for a reason are like what the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) did when he was praying and he carried Umaamah, the \r\n    daughter of Zaynab the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), whose maternal grandfather he was. When he \r\n    stood up he picked her up, and when he prostrated he put her down. \r\n    Al-Bukhaari, 5996; Muslim, 543.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Large movements in cases of necessity include praying whilst \r\n    fighting. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>&ldquo;Guard strictly (five obligatory) As&#8209;Salawaat \r\n    (the prayers) especially the middle Salaah (i.e. the best prayer &#8209; &lsquo;Asr). \r\n    And stand before Allaah with obedience [and do not speak to others during \r\n    the Salaah (prayers)].<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>239.&nbsp;And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on \r\n    foot or riding.

This is the basic principle concerning movements whilst \r\n    praying. Based on this, we say to those who move whilst praying that their \r\n    action is makrooh and detracts from their prayer. This is something that is \r\n    seen in many cases, so you may see a person fiddling with his watch or pen \r\n    or ghutrah or nose or beard and so on. All of that comes under the heading \r\n    of makrooh, unless it is done a great deal and is continuous, in which case \r\n    it is haraam and invalidates the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He also stated that there is no specific number of movements \r\n    that invalidates the prayer, rather it is any movement that contradicts the \r\n    idea of prayer in the sense that if anyone saw this man doing that it would \r\n    look as if he were not praying. This is the kind of movement that \r\n    invalidates the prayer. Hence the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) \r\n    defined it as something based on custom (al-&lsquo;urf) and said: If movements are \r\n    many and are continuous then they invalidate the prayer, without mentioning \r\n    a specific number. Some scholars defined three such movements but that \r\n    requires evidence because everyone who sets a certain limit or number or \r\n    manner should produce evidence, otherwise he is introducing new ideas. <i>\r\n    Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh<\/i>, 13\/309-311&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked about a man who moved a great deal whilst praying: did that \r\n    invalidate his prayer and how could he rid himself of this habit?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Sunnah is to focus on one&rsquo;s prayer with proper humility, \r\n    body and soul, whether it is an obligatory prayer or a naafil prayer, \r\n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&ldquo;Successful indeed are the believers.<\/i><\/p>\r\n    <p>2.&nbsp;Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all \r\n    solemnity and full submissiveness&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>[al-Mu&rsquo;minoon 23:1-2]<\/i>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He must pray in a tranquil and dignified manner. This is one \r\n    of the most important pillars and obligations of prayer, because the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to one who prayed \r\n    badly and was not tranquil and dignified in his prayer: &ldquo;Go back and pray \r\n    for you have not prayed.&rdquo; And he did that three times. Then the man said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any \r\n    better than this, teach me.&rdquo; The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;When you stand up to pray, do wudoo&rsquo; well, then turn to \r\n    face the qiblah and say takbeer, and recite whatever you can of Qur&rsquo;aan. \r\n    Then bow until you are at ease in bowing, then raise your head until you are \r\n    standing up straight. Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, \r\n    then sit up until you are sitting up straight and are at ease in sitting. \r\n    Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then get up until you \r\n    are standing up straight. Then do that throughout your prayer.&rdquo; (Agreed \r\n    upon). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    According to a version narrated by Abu Dawood, he said: &ldquo;Then \r\n    recite the Essence of the Qur&rsquo;aan (al-Faatihah) and whatever Allaah wills.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This saheeh hadeeth indicates that being at ease in the \r\n    postures is a pillar or essential part of the prayer, and an important \r\n    obligation, without which prayer is not valid. Whoever pecks out his prayer \r\n    (by moving too rapidly), there is no prayer for him. Khushoo&rsquo; (proper focus \r\n    and humility) is the essence of prayer. It is prescribed for the believer to \r\n    pay attention to that and strive to achieve it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to defining the movements that contradict this \r\n    ease and focus in prayer and limiting them to three movements, there is no \r\n    hadeeth from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to \r\n    support this idea. Rather that is the suggestion of some scholars for which \r\n    there is no reliable evidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But it is makrooh to fidget during the prayer, such as \r\n    touching one's nose, beard or clothes and being distracted by that. \r\n    Fidgeting a great deal invalidates the prayer. But if it is done a little, \r\n    according to what is customary, or is done a great deal but is not \r\n    continuous, then the prayer is not invalidated thereby. But it is prescribed \r\n    for the believer to maintain proper focus and humility, and to avoid \r\n    fidgeting a little or a lot, and to strive to make his prayer perfect.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The evidence that small movements, or repeated movements that \r\n    are not continuous, do not invalidate the prayer is the report which says \r\n    that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) opened the \r\n    door for &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah one day whilst he was praying.

It was \r\n    narrated from Umm Humayd,&nbsp; the wife of Abu Humayd al-Saa&rsquo;idi, that she came \r\n    to the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &ldquo;O \r\n    Messenger of Allaah, I love to pray with you.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I know that you \r\n    love to pray with me, but your praying in your room is better for you than \r\n    your praying in your house, and your praying in your house is better for you \r\n    than your praying in your courtyard, and your praying in your courtyard is \r\n    better for you than your praying in the mosque of your people, and your \r\n    praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than your praying in \r\n    my mosque.&rdquo; So she gave orders that a &lsquo;mosque&rsquo; be built for her in the \r\n    innermost and darkest part of her house, and she used to pray there until \r\n    she met Allaah (i.e., died).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Narrated by Ahmad, 26550; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, \r\n    1689; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh al-Targheeb<\/i>, 340.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeem Abaadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The reason here is that women's praying at home is better so \r\n    as to avoid fitnah, and that was more strongly emphasized after the <i>\r\n    tabarruj<\/i> (wanton display) that women introduced.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>&lsquo;Awn al-Ma&rsquo;bood<\/i>, 1\/193.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>However, if a woman \r\n    wants to go to the mosque to pray, it is not permissible for anyone to stop \r\n    her, if she adheres to the conditions stipulated for her to go out, because \r\n    the Messenger <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Do not \r\n    stop your womenfolk from going to the mosques if they ask you for \r\n    permission.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 865; Muslim, 442.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also question no.

The scholars \r\n    differed concerning the ruling on one who prays in front of the imam. The \r\n    most correct of the views is that it is permissible when there is an \r\n    excuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Does prayer count if one prays in front of the imam or behind \r\n    him in the mosque with a barrier between them, or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If a person prays in front of the imam, there are three \r\n    scholarly views:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    1 &ndash; The prayer is valid in all cases, even though it may be \r\n    makrooh. This is the well-known view of the madhhab of Maalik, and is the \r\n    former view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    2 &ndash; It is not valid in all cases, as is the view of Abu \r\n    Haneefah, and of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and Ahmad according to the well-known views of \r\n    their madhhabs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    3 &ndash; It is valid if there is an excuse, but not otherwise, \r\n    such as if there is crowding and a person cannot offer Friday prayer or the \r\n    funeral prayer except by standing in front of the imam. In that case, \r\n    praying in front of the imam is better than not praying at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is the view of a number of scholars, and it is an \r\n    opinion in the madhhab of Ahmad and others. It is the fairest view and is \r\n    the most likely to be correct, because the most that can be said about not \r\n    standing in front of the imam is that it is one of the obligatory duties of \r\n    praying in congregation, and all the obligatory duties may be waived when \r\n    there is an excuse, even if they are essential parts of the prayer. So it is \r\n    more appropriate to say that the obligatory duties that are specific to \r\n    prayer in congregation prayer may be waived. Hence things that the \r\n    worshipper is unable to do are waived in his case, such as standing, \r\n    reciting, clothing himself, purity (tahaarah) and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the case of prayer in congregation, he may sit in the \r\n    odd-numbered rak&rsquo;ahs for the purpose of following the imam (i.e., he may sit \r\n    after the first and third rak&rsquo;ahs &ndash; this applies to one who joins the prayer \r\n    late, after one rak&rsquo;ah). If he does that deliberately when he is praying \r\n    alone, his prayer is invalid. If he catches up with the imam when he is \r\n    prostrating or sitting, then he should say takbeer and prostrate with him or \r\n    sit with him, in order to follow him, even though that will not count for \r\n    him. And he should do the prostration of forgetfulness with the imam, even \r\n    though he is not the one who forgot.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Also, during the fear prayer, he does not have to face \r\n    towards the qiblah, and he does many actions, and he leaves the imam before \r\n    the salaam, and he makes up the first rak&rsquo;ah before the imam says the \r\n    salaam, and he does other things that are done in order to be part of the \r\n    congregation. But if he does them with no excuse, then his prayer is \r\n    invalid. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The point here is that one prays in congregation according to \r\n    what one is able to do. If the member of the congregation cannot follow the \r\n    imam except by standing in front of him, the most that can be said is that \r\n    he has not stood where he should in order to be part of the congregation, \r\n    and this is less serious than other options.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The same applies to \r\n    praying behind a row standing alone. If a person cannot find someone to join \r\n    him, and he did not pull someone out of the row to stand with him, then he \r\n    should pray standing alone behind the row; he should not leave the \r\n    congregation. Similarly, if a woman cannot find another woman to stand with \r\n    her, then she should stand on her own behind the row. This is according to \r\n    the consensus of the imams, because standing with another person in a row is \r\n    enjoined when it is possible, not when it is not possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Al-Fataawa al-Kubra<\/i>, 2\/331-333&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was \r\n    asked: Is it permissible for a member of the congregation to stand in front \r\n    of the imam?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The correct view is that it is obligatory for the imam to \r\n    stand in front, and it is not permissible for a member of the congregation \r\n    to stand in front of the imam, because the imaam is supposed to be an \r\n    example and his place is in front of the members of the congregation, so it \r\n    is not permissible for a person to pray in front of the imam. The Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray in front of \r\n    the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and based on that, the \r\n    prayer of those who pray in front of the imam does not count, and they have \r\n    to repeat their prayer. But some scholars made an exception in cases of \r\n    necessity, such as if the mosque is small and there is not enough room for \r\n    everyone; in that case they may pray to the right and the left of the imam, \r\n    and in front of him and behind him, because of necessity.&nbsp; End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i>, \r\n    13\/44&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Based on this, you should try hard to make the place for women behind the imam; if there is no place and you cannot bring the imam forward, then there is no sin in it, in sha Allaah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And Allaah knows best.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4921","question_id":"4921","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span>&nbsp;  <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We praise Allaah Who has guided you to Islam, and we ask Him \r\n    to make you steadfast in following guidance and in faith, for He is \r\n    All-Hearing, Ever Responsive.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to prayer, it is not necessary to have the \r\n    agreement of the owner of the organization or business, and you do not have \r\n    to ask him for permission.

Another method is to make him yawn so much that this \r\n    distracts him from his prayer. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) stated that yawning comes from the Shaytaan, and he told \r\n    us to suppress yawning as much as we can, but if yawning overtakes us, then \r\n    he told us to put our hands over our mouths.

It does not mean that the Shaytaan causes \r\n    yawning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi said: We have explained that every makrooh \r\n    action is attributed to the Shaytaan in Islam because he is the means behind \r\n    it, and every good action is attributed to the angel in Islam because he is \r\n    the means behind it. Yawning is caused by a full stomach and leads to \r\n    laziness, and that is by the means of the Shaytaan, whereas sneezing is \r\n    caused by lack of food, and leads to energy, and that is by the means of the \r\n    angel.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Al-Nawawi said: Yawning is attributed to the Shaytaan because \r\n    it calls to desires, as it is caused by heaviness of the body and lassitude \r\n    and fullness. What is means is: beware of the causes that lead to that, \r\n    which is eating too much. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The phrase &ldquo;if one of you feels the urge to yawn, let him \r\n    suppress it as much as he can&rdquo; means: let him try to stop it. It does not \r\n    mean that he will be able to stop it, because what happens cannot be \r\n    reversed, and it was said that what is meant by &ldquo;if he feels the urge to \r\n    yawn&rdquo; is if he wants to yawn&hellip;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Our Shaykh &ndash; i.e., al-Haafiz al-Iraaqi &ndash; said in <i>Sharh \r\n    al-Tirmidhi<\/i>: Most of the reports in <i>al-Saheehayn<\/i> refer to yawning \r\n    in general terms, but in another report it is limited to yawning when \r\n    praying. So it may be that the general wording is to be understood in terms \r\n    of the specific. The Shaytaan is very keen to distract the worshipper when \r\n    he is praying, and it may be that yawning is more makrooh in the case of \r\n    prayer, but that does not necessarily mean that it is not makrooh in cases \r\n    other than prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fact that it is makrooh in general terms is supported by \r\n    the fact that it comes from the Shaytaan, as was clearly stated by \r\n    al-Nawawi. Ibn al-&lsquo;Arabi said: Yawning should be suppressed in all \r\n    situations, but especially in prayer because it is the situation in which it \r\n    is most appropriate that it be warded off, because it distorts one&rsquo;s \r\n    appearance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the phrase in the report by Muslim, &ldquo;the \r\n    Shaytaan enters&rdquo; it may be that what is meant is entering in a real sense, \r\n    because although the Shaytaan flows through man like his blood, he cannot \r\n    gain any control over him so long as he remembers Allaah, but when a person \r\n    is yawning he is not remembering Allaah, so the Shaytaan is able to enter \r\n    him in a real sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Or it may be that what is meant by entering is gaining \r\n    control over him, because the one who enters a thing is able to gain control \r\n    of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    As for the command to place the hand over the mouth, this is \r\n    the case if he opens his mouth, so he should cover it with his hand, or if \r\n    he yawns whilst his mouth is closed, he should still put his hand over it, \r\n    lest it opens.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the meaning of placing the hand over the mouth \r\n    or covering the mouth with one's garment, which serves the same purpose, the \r\n    hand is mentioned in particular if yawning cannot be warded off otherwise. \r\n    No differentiation is made in this regard between one who is praying and one \r\n    who is not, rather it is more important in the case of prayer as stated \r\n    above, and in this case an exception is made to the prohibition of placing \r\n    the hand over the mouth when praying.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Another thing that is enjoined upon the person who yawns \r\n    whilst praying is to stop reciting until the yawning has ended, lest he \r\n    distort the recitation.

If anyone experiences that, let him do what was enjoined by the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as \r\n    suppressing it as much as he can, and if he cannot, then let him place his \r\n    hand over his mouth so that he will not give the Shaytaan any way to reach \r\n    him. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He should strive to come to prayer when he is energetic and \r\n    active, and he should ask Allaah to protect him against what is happening to \r\n    him in his prayer.

The second view is \r\n    that it can only be one rak&lsquo;ah that is prayed separately from whatever comes \r\n    before it, as is the view of some of the Hijazi scholars. The third view is \r\n    that both are permissible, as is the prevalent view of the Shaafa&lsquo;i madhhab, \r\n    Ahmad and others, and this is the correct view, however they favoured the \r\n    view that it should be separate from what comes before it. If the imam \r\n    thinks that it should be separate but the congregation favours the view that \r\n    Witr prayer should be done like Maghrib, and he goes along with that so as \r\n    to soften their hearts, then he has done well, as the Prophet (blessings and \r\n    peace of Allah be upon him) said to &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah: &ldquo;Were it not that your people \r\n    have only recently left Jaahiliyyah behind, I would have demolished (and \r\n    rebuilt) the Ka&lsquo;bah and made its door level with the ground, and I would \r\n    have given it two doors, one through which the people could enter and one \r\n    through which they could exit.&rdquo; But he refrained from doing that which was \r\n    better in his view lest he alienate the people.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Similarly, if a man thinks that the Basmalah (&ldquo;Bismillah \r\n    ir-Rahmaan ir-Raheem&rdquo;) should be recited out loud but he is leading in \r\n    prayer people who do not think that doing so is mustahabb, or vice versa, \r\n    and he goes along with them, then he has done well. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Majmoo&lsquo; al-Fataawa<\/i>, 22\/268&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) \r\n    was asked:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Is it permissible to refrain from saying Ameen out loud in \r\n    the prayer and not to raise the hands?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Yes, if he is among people who do not raise their hands or do \r\n    not say Ameen out loud, then it is better not to do that, so as to soften \r\n    their hearts and be able to call them to what is good, and so that he can \r\n    teach them and guide them, and so that he will be able to teach them the \r\n    right way. That is because if he differs from them they will find that \r\n    objectionable, because they think that this is the Islamic way, and they \r\n    think that not raising the hands, apart from the opening takbeer, is the \r\n    Islamic way, and they have been used to that all their lives. The same \r\n    applies to not saying Ameen out loud, which is the subject of a well-known \r\n    difference of opinion among the scholars; some of them say that it should be \r\n    said out loud and some of them say that Ameen should not be said out loud. \r\n    According to the hadeeth, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \r\n    him) raised his voice, and according to other hadeeths he said it quietly. \r\n    Even though the correct view is that Ameen should be said out loud and it is \r\n    something mustahabb, and he will be omitting something mustahabb in this \r\n    case, the believer should not do something mustahabb if it will lead to \r\n    division, dispute and fitnah; rather the believer should refrain from doing \r\n    that which is mustahabb in that case. For the one who is calling people to \r\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, if his refraining from something \r\n    will serve a greater interest, then he should do so. An example of that is \r\n    when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) refrained from \r\n    demolishing the Ka&lsquo;bah and rebuilding it on the foundations of Ibraaheem. He \r\n    said: &ldquo;Quraysh have only recently left kufr behind,&rdquo; and it is for that \r\n    reason that he left it as it was and did not change it, in the public \r\n    interest.

If he catches up with him when he is prostrating or in the first \r\n    tashahhud, he should say takbeer when he stands up with the imam for the \r\n    third rak&rsquo;ah, because he is following him, so he should follow him in saying \r\n    takbeer, like one who catches up with him at the beginning.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo; Sharh al-Muhadhdhab<\/i>, 4\/218&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>This is unlike the \r\n    takbeer for bowing, which is counted for him, and it is unlike what he \r\n    should do after that when he moves with the imam, getting up from \r\n    prostration etc. He should say takbeer, following the imam in his movements, \r\n    even if it is not counted for him, as stated by Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him)&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The second opinion is that he should go down in prostration \r\n    with the imam, saying takbeer.

Rather they should start from behind the imam, then the row should be \r\n    completed to both the right and the left, so as to follow the Sunnah of \r\n    having the imam in the middle. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Based on this, then whoever is in the right half of the row \r\n    should look to his left and align himself with whoever is on his left and \r\n    whoever is in the left half should look to his right and align himself with \r\n    whoever is on his right.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the gaps between the feet, the worshipper \r\n    should stand in a moderate fashion, neither standing with his feet together \r\n    nor making them too far apart, because the further apart he makes them, the \r\n    further his shoulders will be from his neighbour&rsquo;s shoulders. Making the \r\n    rows straight and compact is achieved by standing foot-to-foot and \r\n    shoulder-to-shoulder. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the new things that we see some people doing, with no \r\n    evidence in sharee&rsquo;ah, is that in prayer they try to align themselves with a \r\n    person on the right if they are on the right hand side of the row, or to \r\n    align themselves with a person on their left if they are on the left hand \r\n    side of the row, and they turn their feet inward so that their ankles are \r\n    touching the ankles of the people next to them. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This is something for which there is no basis in sharee&rsquo;ah \r\n    and it is going to the extreme in implementing the Sunnah. This is wrong on \r\n    two counts.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The alignment of the row should begin from where the imam is \r\n    standing. Whoever is on the right of the row should align himself by looking \r\n    at those who are to his left (i.e., closer to the imam). Thus the line will \r\n    be straightened and the gaps will be filled. Alignment is done by lining up \r\n    necks, shoulders and ankles, and by completing the front rows.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But to try to spread the legs wide and turn the feet inward \r\n    so that one's ankles touch one&rsquo;s neighbours&rsquo; ankles is an obvious mistake \r\n    and an exaggeration, and a new interpretation which is indicative of going \r\n    to extremes in trying to apply the Sunnah. It causes annoyance and is not \r\n    prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah, and it widens the gaps between people standing in \r\n    prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    That becomes apparent when the people prostrate, and when \r\n    they stand up again they become distracted in trying to fill the gaps and \r\n    turning their feet to make their ankles touch their neighbours&rsquo; ankles, \r\n    which makes them miss out on what they should be doing, which is to make the \r\n    toes point in the direction of the qiblah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Doing that is like \r\n    competing with one&rsquo;s neighbour and trying to take his place. All of that is \r\n    not prescribed in sharee&rsquo;ah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <i>Laa jadeed fi Ahkaam al-Salaah<\/i>, 12. 13.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4932","question_id":"4932","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    When the imam says the salaam and the latecomer stands up to \r\n    make up what he missed of the prayer, then at this point he is in fact \r\n    praying alone, and he should prevent anyone who wants to pass in front of \r\n    him, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    enjoined that.

It was \r\n    narrated from the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \r\n    that he used to pray wearing his shoes. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be \r\n    pleased with him) was asked, &ldquo;Did the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) pray wearing shoes?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; (al-Bukhaari, 386; \r\n    Muslim, 555). This is to be understood as meaning, so long as there is no \r\n    impurity on the shoes; if there is any impurity on them then it is not \r\n    permissible to pray in them. If a person forgets and prays wearing shoes \r\n    when there is some impurity on them, then he has to take them off when he \r\n    finds out or remembers. This is because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa&rsquo;eed \r\n    al-Khudri who said: &ldquo;While the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) was leading his companions in prayer, he took off his \r\n    shoes and placed them to his left. When the people saw that, they took off \r\n    their shoes too. When the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) finished his prayer, he asked, &lsquo;What made you take off \r\n    your shoes?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We saw you take off your shoes, so we took ours off \r\n    too.&rsquo; The Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) said, &lsquo;Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to me and told me that there \r\n    was something dirty on them.&rsquo; When any one of you comes to the mosque, let \r\n    him look and if he sees anything dirty on his shoes, let him wipe them and \r\n    then pray in them.&rdquo; (Abu Dawood, 650; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <i>\r\n    Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, 605).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    One of the reasons why the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) prayed wearing shoes is to be found in the hadeeth, \r\n    &ldquo;Be different from the Jews, who do not pray in their shoes or in their \r\n    leather slippers (<i>khufoof<\/i>).&rdquo; (Abu Dawood, 652; classed as saheeh by \r\n    al-Albaani in <i>Saheeh Abi Dawood<\/i>, 607).&nbsp; That is regarded as mustahabb \r\n    for the purpose of differing from non-Muslims, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    This has to do with the kind of shoes and with the mosque at \r\n    that time. However if the mosque is furnished with carpeting, then the \r\n    mosque should be kept clean of shoes, and no one should enter wearing shoes \r\n    lest the place be made dirty. (<i>Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh &lsquo;Abd-Allaah ibn \r\n    Humayd<\/i>, p. 81). Moreover the furnishings of the mosque are a waqf which \r\n    should not be damaged or destroyed, and if dirt gets onto the carpets it \r\n    will offend those who pray and prostrate on them.

The evidence for that is that the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings \r\n    of Allaah be upon him) prayed Fajr in Mina one day, and when he finished he \r\n    saw two men who had not prayed with him, and asked them, &ldquo;Why did you not \r\n    pray?&rdquo; They said: We prayed in our camp. He said: &ldquo;If you have prayed in \r\n    your camp then you come to the mosque of the congregation, then pray with \r\n    them.&rdquo; This was after Fajr prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: When a person has done tawaaf around the Ka&rsquo;bah, it \r\n    is Sunnah to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs after tawaaf behind Maqaam Ibraaheem. If he \r\n    does tawaaf after Fajr prayer, he may pray the two rak&rsquo;ahs for tawaaf. The \r\n    evidence of that is the words of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him): &ldquo;O Banu &lsquo;Abd Manaaf, do not prevent anyone from \r\n    circumambulating this House or praying here at any time they want, night or \r\n    day.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Some of the scholars quoted this verse as evidence that when \r\n    a person has done tawaaf he may offer the two rak&rsquo;ahs even at times when \r\n    prayer is prohibited.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly: If a person enters the mosque on a Friday when the \r\n    khateeb is delivering the khutbah, if that is when the sun is at its zenith, \r\n    it is permissible for him to pray tahiyyat al-masjid (two rak&rsquo;ahs to greet \r\n    the mosque), because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) was delivering the khutbah to the people when a man came in and sat \r\n    down, and he said to him: &ldquo;Did you pray?&rdquo; He said: No. He said: &ldquo;Get up and \r\n    pray two rak&rsquo;ahs, but make them brief.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fourthly: When entering the mosque. If a person enters the \r\n    mosque after Fajr prayer or after &lsquo;Asr prayer, he should not sit down until \r\n    he has prayed two rak&rsquo;ahs, because there is a reason for this prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Fifthly: Solar eclipse. If the sun is eclipsed after &lsquo;Asr \r\n    prayer, we say: The eclipse prayer is Sunnah, so he should offer the eclipse \r\n    prayer. But if we say that the eclipse prayer is obligatory, then the matter \r\n    is clear, because there is no time at all when an obligatory prayer is \r\n    forbidden.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sixthly: After doing wudoo&rsquo;. If a person does wudoo&rsquo;, it is \r\n    permissible for him to pray two rak&rsquo;ahs at a time when prayer is otherwise \r\n    forbidden, because there is a reason for this prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Seventhly: Istikhaarah prayer. If a person wants to pray \r\n    istikhaarah and ask Allaah for guidance concerning a decision, he should \r\n    pray two rak&rsquo;ahs, then recite the du&rsquo;aa&rsquo; of istikhaarah. If he is faced with \r\n    a matter that he cannot delay, he may pray istikhaarah concerning it at a \r\n    time when prayer is otherwise forbidden. That is permissible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    To sum up, this hadeeth (&ldquo;There is no prayer after Fajr \r\n    prayer and there is no prayer after &lsquo;Asr prayer&rdquo;) is specific; if a person \r\n    offers a prayer for which there is a reason, then it is not prohibited.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What I have mentioned is the view of al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah \r\n    have mercy on him) and one of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad, as \r\n    well as being the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on \r\n    him) and it is the correct view, because there is no prohibition on the \r\n    prayers for which there is a reason.

So if a man \r\n    prays in a single garment that covers his &lsquo;awrah, but no part of it is on \r\n    his shoulder, then his prayer is valid although it is makrooh, whether he \r\n    was able to put something on his shoulder or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>Ahmad and some of \r\n    the salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them) said: If he was able to put \r\n    something over his shoulder, his prayer is not valid unless he covers his \r\n    shoulder, because of the apparent meaning of the hadeeth.

Moreover, the \r\n    author said: &ldquo;with one of his shoulders&rdquo; but the hadeeth indicates that both \r\n    shoulders must be covered. What the author said is the well known view of \r\n    the madhhab.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The second opinion \r\n    is that covering the shoulders is Sunnah and not obligatory, and there is no \r\n    difference between obligatory and naafil prayers, because of the hadeeth, \r\n    &ldquo;if it is too small, tie it around your waist&rdquo;. This view is the more \r\n    correct one, and it is the view of the majority. The idea that there should \r\n    be something on the shoulders is not because the shoulders are &lsquo;awrah, \r\n    rather it is so that the clothing may be complete and the waist wrapper be \r\n    tied properly, because if it is not secured at the shoulders, it may come \r\n    loose and fall. In this case the covering of the shoulders is sought for \r\n    another purpose; it is not sought in and of itself.

When the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) travelled, he would take with him a \r\n    short piece of wood and pray facing it. It is a confirmed Sunnah but it is \r\n    not obligatory, because it is proven that on some occasions, he <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace \r\n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed without a sutrah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to that which invalidates the prayer, it is a \r\n    donkey, a black dog, and an adult woman, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The prayer of a Muslim man is \r\n    invalidated if he does not have in front of him something like the back of a \r\n    saddle, by (the passage in front of him of) a woman, a donkey or a black \r\n    dog.&rdquo; Narrated by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh<\/i> from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him). Muslim also narrated it from Abu Hurayrah \r\n    (may Allaah be pleased with him), without mentioning the word black. The \r\n    basic principle is that a general statement is to be interpreted in terms of \r\n    the specific statement. In the hadeeth of Ibn &lsquo;Abbaas it says &ldquo;A woman who \r\n    menstruates&rdquo; i.e., an adult woman. The correct view is that which is \r\n    indicated by the hadeeth: that these three invalidate the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the words of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased \r\n    with her), they are her own opinion and conclusion. She said: &ldquo;What a bad \r\n    thing to liken us to donkeys and dogs.&rdquo; She said that she used to lie in \r\n    front of the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \r\n    him) when he was praying, but that is not passing in front, because lying is \r\n    not called passing . The Sunnah concerning that was not known to her, and \r\n    the one who learns something is a proof against the one who is unaware of \r\n    it. If a person prays facing someone who is opposite him, sitting or lying \r\n    down, that does not affect him. Rather what invalidates the prayer is if it \r\n    passes in front of him from one side to another, if the one who passes is \r\n    front is one of the three mentioned and passes in front of him, or between \r\n    him and the sutrah. If the female is young and has not reached the age of \r\n    puberty, or the dog is not black, or something such as a camel or sheep and \r\n    the like passes in front, then none of these invalidate the prayer. But it \r\n    is prescribed for the one who is praying not to let anything pass in front \r\n    of him, even if it does not invalidate the prayer, because of the hadeeth of \r\n    Abu Sa&rsquo;eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him), which says that the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If one of \r\n    you prays facing something that is screening him from the people, and \r\n    someone wants to pass [directly] in front of him, let him push him away, and \r\n    if he insists then let him fight him, for he is a devil.&rdquo; Saheeh &ndash; agreed upon.

In this case we have a conflict between two prohibitions: \r\n    the prohibition on letting the garment come below the ankle and the \r\n    prohibition on rolling up the garment when praying.

Is it possible to draw an analogy with prayer, i.e., does \r\n    sputum invalidate the prayer?<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    He replied:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The fuqaha&rsquo; are not unanimously agreed on this. Rather the \r\n    madhhab of Imam Ahmad has two opinions as to whether it breaks the fast or \r\n    not. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly:<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant by the kind of sputum that breaks the fast is \r\n    that which reaches the mouth. As for that which appears in the throat and \r\n    goes down into the chest, that does not break the fast. I do not think the \r\n    sputum reaches the mouth of anyone and is then swallowed, because it is \r\n    off-putting. But whatever the case, most of the Hanbali fuqaha&rsquo; say that if \r\n    sputum reaches the mouth and is then swallowed, it invalidates the fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the analogy of that, that if that happens \r\n    during prayer, it invalidates the prayer, if we say that this is like food. \r\n    But I have not come across anyone discussing this issue with regard to \r\n    prayer. Moreover the idea that it breaks the fast if it reaches the mouth \r\n    then is swallowed is subject to further discussion, because this is not \r\n    regarded as eating or drinking. It did not enter his body from outside, \r\n    rather it is still inside him, and the mouth is regarded as part of the \r\n    outside, not part of the inside.

If he omits or \r\n    changes some of the letters, this is a kind of recitation that is not \r\n    permissible. Rather he has to recite carefully and at a measured pace, so \r\n    that the letters and words are pronounced in full. The same applies to \r\n    prayer: he should not rush when bowing or prostrating, or when sitting \r\n    between the two prostrations, or when standing after bowing. Rather he \r\n    should move with deliberation and calmly. This is what is required. Moving \r\n    calmly is an essential obligation; &ldquo;pecking&rdquo; and moving hastily in prayer \r\n    invalidates the prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    We advise the questioner to move carefully and calmly when \r\n    bowing, and not to rush; he should say <i>Subhaan Rabbiy al-&lsquo;Azeem<\/i> three \r\n    or more times, and he should say: <i>Subhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, \r\n    Allaahumma ighfir li<\/i> (Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise; O Allah, \r\n    forgive me). When he raises his head from bowing he should settle into the \r\n    standing posture and say: <i>Rabbana wa laka&rsquo;l-hamd hamdan katheeran \r\n    tayyiban mubaarakan fihi mil&rsquo; al-samawaati wa mil&rsquo; al-ard wa mil&rsquo;a ma \r\n    baynahuma wa mil&rsquo;a ma shi&rsquo;ta min shay&rsquo;in ba&lsquo;d<\/i> (Our Lord, to You be \r\n    praise, much good and blessed praise, filling the heavens, filling the \r\n    earth, filling what is between them and filling whatever You will besides). \r\n    This is what is best for him. Saying <i>Rabbana wa laka&rsquo;l-hamd <\/i>is \r\n    obligatory according to the correct opinion. If he completes it by saying <i>\r\n    hamdan katheeran tayyiban mubaarakan fihi mil&rsquo; al-samawaati wa mil&rsquo; al-ard \r\n    wa mil&rsquo;a ma baynahuma wa mil&rsquo;a ma shi&rsquo;ta min shay&rsquo;in ba&lsquo;d<\/i>, that is more \r\n    complete and better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    And some extra words were narrated from the Messenger \r\n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): &ldquo;<i>Ahl al-thana&rsquo; wa&rsquo;l-majd, \r\n    ahaqqu ma qaala al-&lsquo;abd, wa kulluna laka &lsquo;abd, laa maani&lsquo; lima a&lsquo;tayta wa la \r\n    mu&lsquo;ti lima mana&lsquo;ta, wa la yanfa&lsquo;u dha&rsquo;l-jaddi minka al-jadd<\/i> (You are the \r\n    One Who most deserves praise and glorification, (this is) the soundest thing \r\n    a slave could say, and we are all Your slaves; none can withhold what You \r\n    give, and none can give what You withhold, and the good fortune of any \r\n    fortunate person is to no avail against You). This is perfection of praise. \r\n    Similarly when prostrating, he should not rush, and he should prostrate on \r\n    the seven parts: the forehead, the nose, the hands, the knees and the toes; \r\n    he should settle in the posture and not rush, and he should say <i>Subhaan \r\n    Rabbiy al-A&lsquo;la, Subhaan Rabbiy al-A&lsquo;la, Subhaan Rabbiy al-A&lsquo;la, subhaanaka \r\n    Allaahumma wa bi hamdika Allaahumma ighfir li<\/i> (Glory be to my Lord Most \r\n    High. Glory be to my Lord Most High, Glory be to my Lord Most High, Glory be \r\n    to You, O Allah, and praise, O Allah, forgive me). He should offer whatever \r\n    supplication he can, and say: <i>Allaahumma ighfir li dhanbi kullahu diqqahu \r\n    wa jullahu, awwalahu wa aakhirahu, &lsquo;alaaniyatahu wa sirrahu<\/i> (O Allah, \r\n    forgive me all my sins, small and great, first and last, open and secret). \r\n    This is a prescribed du&lsquo;aa&rsquo;. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) said: &ldquo;The closest a person is to his Lord is when he is \r\n    prostrating, so offer a lot of du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; then.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;As for \r\n    prostration, strive hard in supplication, because it is more likely that you \r\n    may receive a response.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The believer should not rush when prostrating; rather he has \r\n    to settle in the position, as this is one of the essential parts of prayer \r\n    and is necessary. Yet it is prescribed not to pause to long (in any \r\n    position) and not to rush, and he should offer du&lsquo;aa&rsquo; whilst prostrating and \r\n    repeat the words Subhaana <i>Rabbiy al-A&lsquo;la<\/i>. What is obligatory is to \r\n    say it once, but repeating it three or five or seven times is better.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Between the two prostrations he should also settle in the \r\n    posture and not rush. He should sit up between the two prostrations until \r\n    every vertebra returns to its place, and he should say, <i>Rabb ighfir li, \r\n    Rabb ighfir li, Rabb ighfir li, Allaahumma ighfir li wa&rsquo;rhamni wa&rsquo;hdini \r\n    wa&rsquo;jburni wa&rsquo;rzuqni wa &lsquo;aafini<\/i> (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, Lord \r\n    forgive me, O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, comfort me, \r\n    grant me provision, and grant me well being). All of that was narrated from \r\n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslim should \r\n    follow the example of his Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    and do as he did, and he should not be hasty in such matters, for prayer is \r\n    the foundation of Islam and prayer is an important matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So we advise the questioner to pay attention to this matter \r\n    and to fear Allah and remember that He is always watching; he should do his \r\n    prayer at a measured pace, and not rush. Similarly, his recitation should be \r\n    slow and careful, and not rushed; rather he should recite clearly, pondering \r\n    and thinking about (what he is reciting), and try to benefit from it. We ask \r\n    Allah to help and guide us all.

Rabbits, goats \r\n      and other animals do not interrupt the prayer. Rather the prayer is only \r\n      interrupted by three things according to the correct scholarly opinion: an \r\n      adult woman, a black dog and a donkey. This is what is narrated from the \r\n      Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: &ldquo;Three \r\n      things interrupt a man&rsquo;s prayer [by passing in front of him] if he does \r\n      not have in front of him something the height of the back of a saddle: a \r\n      woman, a donkey and a black dog.&rdquo; It was said: O Messenger of Allah, why \r\n      black and not red or yellow? He said: &ldquo;The black dog is a devil.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What is meant is that these three are the things that \r\n    interrupt the prayer according to the correct scholarly opinion. There is \r\n    some difference of opinion among the scholars, but the correct view is that \r\n    prayer is only interrupted by one of these three things, either a woman, or \r\n    a donkey in general, or a black dog specifically. As for other kinds of \r\n    animals, such as dogs that are not black, or camels, goats, rabbits, cats \r\n    and so on, none of these interrupt the prayer. But if it is possible not to \r\n    let them walk in front, and the worshipper tries not to let them pass in \r\n    front of him that is better. So he should not let anything pass in front of \r\n    him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Similarly, if a man walks in front of the worshipper it does \r\n    not interrupt his prayer, but it detracts from its reward, so he should \r\n    prevent anyone walking in front of him if possible. It is not permissible to \r\n    walk in front of the worshipper. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \r\n    be upon him) forbade that and said: &ldquo;If the one who walks in front of a \r\n    person who is praying knew (the sin) that is upon him, standing for forty \r\n    would be better for him than passing in front of someone who is praying.&rdquo; \r\n    And he enjoined the one who is praying facing something to screen him from \r\n    the people not to let anyone walk in front of him; rather he should stop \r\n    him. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;If one of you \r\n    prays facing something to screen him from the people, if someone wants to \r\n    walk in front of him, let him push him away, and if he insists then let him \r\n    fight him, for he is no more than a devil.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Sunnah indicates that the one who is praying should \r\n    prevent the one who wants to pass in front of him even if he is not one of \r\n    those three, if he is not a dog or a woman or a donkey. He should not let \r\n    anything pass in front of him, whether it is a human being or an animal, if \r\n    it is possible for him to prevent that. But if it overcomes him and passes \r\n    in front of him, it does not affect his prayer. His prayer is affected and \r\n    interrupted by one of the three: a black dog or a woman or a donkey. These \r\n    three interrupt the prayer because of the saheeh hadeeth quoted previously.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Sunnah is for the believer who wants to pray to put \r\n    something in front of him, such as a chair or a spear that he sticks in the \r\n    ground, or a wall or pillar that he faces towards when he is praying so that \r\n    nothing will pass in front of him that could interrupt his prayer. If people \r\n    are passing beyond his sutrah (screen), that does not affect his prayer. But \r\n    if they pass in front of him and between him and the sutrah, this is what is \r\n    not allowed. If the one that passes in front of him is a woman or a donkey \r\n    or a black dog, his prayer is interrupted. If he has a sutrah and they pass \r\n    in front of him close to him, this is not allowed. If he does not have a \r\n    sutrah and they pass close to him, within three cubits or less, then that \r\n    interrupts his prayer, but if they pass far away, then that does not matter. \r\n    If they pass in front of him, more than three cubits away, that does not \r\n    matter, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \r\n    prayed inside the Ka&lsquo;bah, leaving three cubits between him and the western \r\n    wall. The scholars quoted this as evidence that this is the maximum distance \r\n    at which the sutrah should be placed; the sutrah should be three cubits away \r\n    or less. If the thing passes further away than that, its passing (in front \r\n    of the worshipper) does not affect his prayer. If there is a sutrah, \r\n    whatever passes beyond it does not matter. What is meant by interrupting the \r\n    prayer, as mentioned here, is rendering it invalid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The majority of scholars say that his prayer is interrupted \r\n    in the sense of being rendered imperfect, but the correct view is that it is \r\n    interrupted in the sense that he has to repeat it. So if it is an obligatory \r\n    prayer then he has to repeat it. So he has to repeat it if one of these \r\n    three pass in front of the worshipper between him and his sutrah, he has to \r\n    repeat the prayer.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him).&nbsp;<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Fataawa Noor &lsquo;ala al-Darb, 2\/830-832"},{"id":"4955","question_id":"4955","answers":"Praise be to Allaah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n      If (a person) comes when the people are bowing, what he \r\n      must do first is say the takbeer for starting to pray (takbeerat \r\n      al-ihraam), then if he can, he should say the takbeer for bowing whilst \r\n      leaning forward; if he cannot do that, then the takbeerat al-ihraam will \r\n      suffice, according to the correct scholarly view.&nbsp; But if he does both, \r\n      that is better and more perfect, and will avoid a matter concerning which \r\n      the scholars differed.

In this case it is not correct for him to change his \r\n          intention by now intending to pray &#8216;Asr. Rather he should stop praying, \r\n          then say Allaahu akbar and re-join the prayer with the imaam, with the \r\n          intention of praying &#8216;Asr. That is because the intention is a condition \r\n          of the prayer&#8217;s validity. The basis for this (i.e., for the intention \r\n          being required for prayer) is that whoever changes his intention for \r\n          one specific prayer, whether it is fard (obligatory) or naafil (supererogatory), \r\n          to another specific prayer, the prayer he originally intended to pray \r\n          becomes invalid and cannot be counted as the other prayer for which \r\n          he changed his intention.

We have explained the \r\n    ruling on this above.<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>&nbsp;2 &ndash; Delaying the prayer until the end of the time for that prayer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>See <i>al-Mawsoo&rsquo;ah al-Fiqhiyyah<\/i>, 10\/6&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is permissible to offer a prayer at the end of its time, because of the hadeeth narrated by \r\n    Muslim (614) from Abu Moosa al-Ash&rsquo;ari, that someone came to the Messenger of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked \r\n    him about the times of prayer&hellip; and the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained to him the beginning and end of the time \r\n    for each prayer, and said, &ldquo;The time is between these two.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But if delaying the prayer means that one will miss out on praying in congregation \r\n    and will pray it alone at the end of its time, then it is haraam because it means not praying in congregation, so long as one does not have an \r\n    excuse for not praying in congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is better to do the prayer at the beginning of its time, except for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; \r\n    prayer and Zuhr prayer when it is very hot; in these cases it is better to do them at the end of their allotted times.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>It is better to do the prayer at the time required in sharee&rsquo;ah. Hence the Prophet \r\n    <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, answering the one who asked him which deed is most beloved to Allaah, &ldquo;Prayer done on \r\n    time.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 527; Muslim, 85. He did not say, prayer at the beginning of its time. That is because the prayers include some \r\n    which it is Sunnah to pray sooner and some which it is Sunnah to pray later. It is Sunnah to pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; later, after one-third of the night has \r\n    passed. Hence if a woman is at home and asks which is better for me, to pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; when I hear the adhaan or to delay it until one-third of the \r\n    night has passed? We say, it is better to delay it until one-third of the night has passed, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) delayed one night until they said, &ldquo;O Messenger of Allaah, the women and children have fallen asleep,&rdquo; so he went out and led \r\n    them in prayer, and said, &ldquo;This would be its time, were that not too difficult for my ummah.&rdquo; So if a woman is in her house, it is better for her \r\n    to delay it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly, if it so happens that some men are travelling, and they ask whether \r\n    they should pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; sooner or later, we would tell them that it is better for them to delay it.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly if a group goes out for a trip and the time for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; comes, is it \r\n    better for them to pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; sooner or later? We say that it is better for them to delay it if that will not cause them any hardship.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the case of the other prayers it is better to pray them sooner unless there is \r\n    a reason for doing otherwise. So Fajr should be prayed sooner, Zuhr should be prayed sooner, &lsquo;Asr should be prayed sooner and Maghrib should be \r\n    prayed sooner, unless there is a reason for doing otherwise. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Such reasons include the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If it is intensely hot, then it is better to delay Zuhr prayer until it cools down \r\n    a little, i.e., until it is nearly time for &lsquo;Asr, because it cools down a little when it is nearly time for &lsquo;Asr. When it is intensely hot, it is \r\n    better to pray when it is cooler, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;When it is intensely hot, then wait \r\n    until it cools down before you pray, for intense heat is from the breeze of Hell.&rdquo; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 537; Muslim, 615.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was on a journey and \r\n    Bilaal stood up to give the call to prayer, and he said, &ldquo;Wait until it gets cooler.&rdquo; Then [Bilaal] stood up to give the call to prayer, and [the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, &ldquo;Wait until it gets cooler.&rdquo; Then [Bilaal] stood up to give the call to prayer, \r\n    and [the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] gave him permission to do so. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 629; Muslim, 616.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Another reason is if it will be possible to pray in congregation at the end of the \r\n    time but not at the beginning, in which case delay is preferable. For example, if a man is outside the city when the time for prayer comes, and he \r\n    knows that he will reach the city and catch up with the congregation at the end of the time for prayer, is it better for him to pray when the time \r\n    for prayer comes, or to delay the prayer until he reaches the congregation?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>We say that it is better for him to delay the prayer until he catches up with the \r\n    congregation; we say that it is even obligatory for him to delay in this case, so that he can catch up with the congregation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p><i>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam<\/i>, p. 287.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4985","question_id":"4985","answers":"Praise be to Allaah. \r\n      <\/span> <\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>There is nothing wrong with \r\n    a man or woman praying in the bedroom, because the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;The earth has been made a place of \r\n    prostration and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man of my \r\n    ummah is when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.&rdquo; Narrated by \r\n    al-Bukhaari (335) and Muslim (521). &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and \r\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to offer naafil prayers and qiyaam \r\n    al-layl in the room of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and the \r\n    rooms of his other wives (may Allaah be pleased with them).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>It is well known that men \r\n    are enjoined to offer prayer in congregation, when the call for prayer is \r\n    given, but if a man misses a prayer or is excused for not going to the \r\n    mosque, or he offers a naafil prayer in his bedroom, there is nothing wrong \r\n    with that.

He said: Women at the time of the Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of \r\n    Allaah be upon him) used to wear chemises in their homes, and not every \r\n    woman had two garments. Hence if menstrual blood got onto her garment, she \r\n    could wash it and pray in it. The hands and feet are not &lsquo;awrah when \r\n    praying, or with regard to looking. Based on that, there is no solid \r\n    evidence on this matter, and I follow Shaykh al-Islam in this regard; this \r\n    is how we understand it, but we cannot be certain of it, because even if a \r\n    woman has a garment that reaches to the floor, when she prostrates the \r\n    bottom of her feet will appear.

Makkah lies to the north of the equator (between it and the \r\n    Tropic of Cancer).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What this means is that the sun passes over Makkah twice a \r\n    year, once when it moves north of the equator and again when it returns. \r\n    When the time for Zuhr prayer begins according to local time in Makkah, the \r\n    sun is directly overhead in Makkah, and whoever looks at the sun at that \r\n    moment will be facing the direction of the qiblah precisely, because at that \r\n    moment the sun is directly above Makkah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    These two days are 28 May at 9:18 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time \r\n    (GMT); and 16 July at 9:27 a.m. GMT.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But this phenomenon is only of benefit to the one who sees \r\n    the sun at that moment; for people in places where it is night at this time, \r\n    they cannot benefit from this.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But there are two other days when the sun is directly above \r\n    the place that directly opposite the Ka&rsquo;bah on the other side of the Earth \r\n    (i.e., the antipodes of the Ka&rsquo;bah). They are 28 November at 2109 GMT and 13 \r\n    January at 2109 GMT.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    But the direction of the qiblah is the direct opposite of the \r\n    direction in which the sun is, so the person should turn his back on the \r\n    sun, then the direction which is in front of him is the direction of the \r\n    qiblah.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thus it is possible for all the people of the earth to determine the direction of the qiblah precisely by means of the sun.<\/p><br \/><br \/>Source: Islam Q&A"},{"id":"4994","question_id":"4994","answers":"Praise be to Allah.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Firstly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The Sunnah is to give the adhaan when the time for the prayer \r\n    begins, because that was the usual practice of the mu&rsquo;adhdhins of the \r\n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).

Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously \r\n    agreed that the Sunnah is to give the adhaan for prayer after the time for \r\n    the prayer has begun, except in the case of Fajr. Because the adhaan was \r\n    prescribed to signal the time for prayer, it is not prescribed to do it \r\n    before the time begins, lest the purpose for which it was prescribed is \r\n    missed. End quote.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked \r\n    about the ruling on delaying the adhaan from the beginning of the time for \r\n    prayer.<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;He said: If a person is in a town, it is not appropriate to \r\n    delay it from the beginning of the time, because that will lead to chaos and \r\n    differences among the mu&rsquo;adhdhins, and it will lead to people becoming \r\n    confused as to which of them is more correct, the one who does it sooner or \r\n    the one who does it later? But if the adhaan has nothing to do with the town \r\n    (rather it is the matter of a group of people working in some institution \r\n    and the like) then it is up to them, but it is better for them to give the \r\n    adhaan at the beginning of the time and then pray, because doing the prayer \r\n    at the beginning of its time is preferable except in cases where it is \r\n    prescribed to delay it. If it is prescribed to delay it, then the adhaan may \r\n    also be delayed. Hence it is proven in <i>Saheeh al-Bukhaari<\/i> that the \r\n    Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was on a journey and \r\n    the mu&rsquo;adhdhin got up to give the call to prayer, but the Prophet (blessings \r\n    and peace of Allah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Wait until it cools down.&rdquo; Then he \r\n    wanted to get up and he said, &ldquo;Wait until it cools down.&rdquo; Then he wanted to \r\n    get up and he said, &ldquo;Wait until it cools down,&rdquo; until the hill was the same \r\n    length as its shadow, then he gave the call to prayer. This indicates that \r\n    the adhaan is prescribed when the prayer is prescribed. If the prayer is one \r\n    of those that may be delayed, such as Zuhr prayer in the case of extreme \r\n    heat and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; prayer, then the adhaan may be delayed. This applies outside \r\n    of towns and villages in which there are mu&rsquo;adhdhins.

In the middle of February, the time for Zuhr begins \r\n    at approximately 11.55 am according to the Umm al-Qura timetable.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    What this means is that on some days of the year, you will be \r\n    giving the adhaan for Zuhr prayer before the time for it begins, and this is \r\n    not permissible according to scholarly consensus, as stated above.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    So you have to revise the time for the adhaan of Zuhr, even \r\n    if that means delaying it so that it will be at 12.00 noon.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Thirdly:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace \r\n    of Allah be upon him) when he was asked which deed is most beloved to Allah, \r\n    and he said: &ldquo;Prayer offered on time&rdquo; (narrated by al-Bukhaari (527) and \r\n    Muslim (85), this indicates that prayer should be offered on time.

Imam \r\n    al-Shaafa&rsquo;i (may Allaah have mercy on him) was of the view that it is \r\n    essential to face the Ka&rsquo;bah head on even for the one who is far away, and \r\n    prayer is invalidated in his view if there is a deviation of this type from \r\n    the qiblah. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    See also <i>al-Majmoo&rsquo;<\/i> (3\/208).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \r\n    Facing the qiblah means either facing the qiblah head on or facing its \r\n    direction.

But if he is far \r\n    away and cannot see the Ka&rsquo;bah, then he must face its direction. The further \r\n    away a person is from Makkah, the more flexible the direction is for him, \r\n    because the larger a circle grows, the more leeway there is, hence the \r\n    Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &ldquo;Whatever is \r\n    between the east and the west is qiblah.&rdquo; That was with regard to the people \r\n    of Madeenah, and the scholars stated that a slight deviation in the qiblah \r\n    does not matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The well known directions are four: north, south, east and \r\n    west.

He replied: What we think is that a rug should not be set out for the \r\n    imam on which there are images of mosques, because it may distract him and \r\n    he may look at them which will affect his prayer. Hence when the Messenger \r\n    of Allaah <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed in a cloak \r\n    that had stripes, he looked at the stripes when he finished and said: &ldquo;Take \r\n    this cloak to Abu Jahm ibn Hudhayfah, and bring me his plain garment, for \r\n    they distracted me just now when I was praying.&rdquo; Agreed upon from the \r\n    hadeeth of &lsquo;Aa&rsquo;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If it so happens that the imam will not be distracted by that \r\n    because he is blind, or because this is so commonplace to him that he will \r\n    not pay any attention to it, then we do not think that there is anything \r\n    wrong with him praying on it. And Allaah is the Source of help. End quote \r\n    from <i>Majmoo&rsquo; Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen<\/i> (12\/362).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa&rsquo;imah<\/i> (6\/181): \r\n    Question: What is the ruling on praying on carpets that contain drawings of \r\n    Islamic buildings as in the case of the carpets that we see in mosques \r\n    nowadays, and what is the ruling on praying on them if they contain crosses? \r\n    When we want to judge whether it is a cross, does the lower portion have to \r\n    be long and the upper portion short, and the two sides equal, or do we judge \r\n    that whenever two lines cross perpendicularly that it is a cross? We hope \r\n    that you can advise us about this matter because it is a common problem. May \r\n    Allaah preserve you and take care of you.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Answer: Firstly: The mosques are the houses of Allaah, which \r\n    were built for the establishment of regular prayer and so that Allaah might \r\n    be glorified therein morning and evening with proper presence of mind, \r\n    humility, focus and fear of Allaah. Decorations and adornments in the \r\n    furnishings and on the walls of the mosque distract one from remembrance of \r\n    Allaah (dhikr) and take away a lot of focus from the worshippers, hence that \r\n    was regarded as makrooh by most of the salaf. The Muslims should avoid that \r\n    in their mosques so as to protect their worship by avoiding distractions in \r\n    the places where they seek to draw closer to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds, \r\n    in the hope of attaining a greater reward. As for prayers offered there, \r\n    they are valid.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Secondly: the cross is the symbol of the Christians which \r\n    they put in their places of worship and venerate it, and they regard it as a \r\n    symbol of a false belief, which is the crucifixion of the Messiah &lsquo;Eesa ibn \r\n    Maryam (Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him). Allaah has stated that the \r\n    Jews and the Christians lied concerning that, as He says (interpretation of \r\n    the meaning): <i>&ldquo;they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so \r\n    to them&rdquo; [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:157]<\/i>. So it is not permissible for the Muslims to \r\n    use it in the furnishings of their mosques or elsewhere, or to leave it \r\n    there; rather they should get rid of it and erase it and leave no trace of \r\n    it, so as to avoid evil and avoid resembling the Christians in general and \r\n    in their holy places in particular. It makes no difference whether the \r\n    vertical line in the cross is longer than the horizontal line or it is the \r\n    same, or whether the upper part of the two crossed lines is shorter or the \r\n    same as the lower part.

The same applies to anyone who prays then finds out that the time for \r\n    the prayer had not yet begun.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person \r\n    prays before the time (for that prayer) begins, it does not count, according \r\n    to the view of the majority of scholars, whether he did that deliberately or \r\n    by mistake, all of the prayer or part of it. This was the view of al-Zuhri, \r\n    al-Awzaa&rsquo;i, al-Shaafa&rsquo;i and ashaab al-ra&rsquo;i. It was also narrated that Ibn \r\n    &lsquo;Umar and Abu Moosa repeated Fajr because they offered it before the time \r\n    for it began.&nbsp; End quote from <i>al-Mughni<\/i>, 2\/45.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The basic principle is that the muezzin does not give the \r\n    adhaan until after the time for the prayer has begun, especially in a case \r\n    such as yours, when you have no evidence to suggest that the muezzin made a \r\n    mistake about the time or was not careful about it. Rather the fact that you \r\n    did this again indicates that you were not very careful about checking the \r\n    beginning of the time, so you should have relied on the muezzin in order to \r\n    know when the time began, especially since the people of the place where you \r\n    were relied on him, and there is nothing to suggest that they objected to \r\n    him. <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    &nbsp;Ibn Qudaamah&nbsp; (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a \r\n    person hears the adhaan from one who is trustworthy and knows the time, he \r\n    may rely on him, because it seems that he does not say the adhaan until \r\n    after the time for prayer has begun, so it is as if his adhaan announces the \r\n    beginning of the time. The Prophet <!--#include virtual=\"\/saws.htm\" --> (peace and blessings of Allaah be \r\n    upon him) said: &ldquo;The muezzin is a position of trust.&rdquo; Narrated by Abu \r\n    Dawood. Were it not that he is to be relied upon, he would not be in a \r\n    position of trust. Moreover, because the adhaan is prescribed so that the \r\n    time may be known, if it were not permissible to rely on the muezzin then \r\n    there would be no point in prescribing the adhaan. The people still gather \r\n    in their mosques and jaami&rsquo;s at the times of prayer, and when they hear the \r\n    adhaan they get up to pray, based on the adhaan of the muezzin without \r\n    checking the time, so there is consensus on this matter.
