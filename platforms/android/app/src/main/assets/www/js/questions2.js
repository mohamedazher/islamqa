Then I had some problems in my studies and failed to get the grades that would enable me to continue studying engineering, and I felt that that was unfair, so I said: So and so does not pray but Allaah made it easy for him to become an engineer, whereas I pray but I did not succeed. I could not bear it and I said to myself some things that put me beyond the pale of Islam, such as reviling Allaah and the faith, and reviling the divine decree. I stopped praying for a short while, even though I was uncomfortable about not responding to the adhaan and my heart became attached to the prayer. After my anger dissipated, I realized the enormity of my transgression against the rights of Allaah, and I was afraid that I might die when Allaah was angry with me. I wept and I could not continue with my studies because I was always worried about my sins. I went and looked for a fatwa that might give me peace of mind. Will Allaah forgive my sins? It says: &ldquo;Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills&rdquo; [al-Nisa&rsquo; 4:48]. I asked about this matter and I rejoiced when I read the verse in which Allaah says: &ldquo;Say: O &lsquo;Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft&#8209;Forgiving, Most Merciful&rdquo;[al-Zumar 39:53].

All children in their family have been named in this way - the initial of the first name is chosen based on the month (or date?) when the baby is born.

From the way some of them speak, they appear to be good and pious, but some of the things they do are very strange.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;When I first starting going on the Internet, some of the sites I went to were chat rooms. I admit that this was a mistake on my part, but I have put matters right, alhamdu-Lillaah. I stopped going into chat rooms two weeks after I started. But whilst I was visiting chat rooms I got to know a man who, from what he says, appears to be righteous and pious, and keen to pursue good. He tries to put right whatever he can, and he sends out letters containing words of religious exhortation by e-mail to everyone he knows. He goes into chat rooms on the basis of the belief and principle that he adheres to, which is that good people should be present in these sites, in which there are a lot of bad people, in order to crowd out the bad people. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;The main thing is that I stopped going to the chat rooms, but I continued to communicate with him by e-mail. He was trying to persuade me that I had to go to the chat rooms in order to reform the women, because women are closer to other women, especially on sites where there are so many women that the &ldquo;wolves&rdquo; are tempted to come and &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; them. I did not respond to his request because I knew how damaging it is to go to those sites where the evil outweighs the good. The way he spoke to me in his letters was very respectful and he was very selective in the words he chose; I was equally careful in the way I spoke to him. This encouraged me to ask him to teach me the basics of the Internet via e-mail, or, if that was not possible, via &ldquo;messenger&rdquo;. He agreed to do that via &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; so we started the lessons, and he carried on being respectful and serious. But I noticed that sometimes he would joke or get carried away in talking about matters that had nothing to do with the lesson, which he called educational topics. And he also asked about some personal matters such as the city where I live, etc. I knew that he was in touch with a group of women with whom he discussed educational matters and the state of the Muslims, etc., and that these discussions might go on for hours. I did not like this state of affairs and I told him that frankly. I also told him that this joking was not permitted, and that he should be formal when speaking with women, and not use certain phrases. He quoted as evidence that it is permissible to speak with women the fact that the shaykhs answer questions from women; and he quoted as evidence that it is permissible to joke the hadeeth &ldquo;No old women will enter Paradise&rdquo; &ndash; meaning that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was joking with that old woman when he said that to her. He said that being too formal and reserved may lead to the opposite result. I was not convinced by his arguments, because from the little knowledge that I have, this is not permitted. I asked him to complete the lessons via e-mail and not to use the &ldquo;messenger&rdquo;, and until now he has not replied at all. I find it strange and wonder how he could do that when he has reached such a high level of knowledge and religious commitment, as well as being haafiz al-Qur&rsquo;aan (i.e., he has memorized the Qur&rsquo;aan by heart). I want to point out that this is a subtle trap that is one of the snares of the Shaytaan, by means of which he confuses people. What is the final word on this problem?

But there is a major problem which is going through. My mother is very friendly with us and she used to tell us all her secrets. She tells us that she loves my uncle more than my father. Even though my uncle and his family lives in another country, he comes to this country every month for business purposes and stays in our house. My mother never talks to him directly as my father doesn't like talking with non-mahram. but she sends mail , messages and even chat with him . She tells us that he loves her back. I am not quite sure whether my uncle loves her back or not. But he responds to her chats, mails and messages. My father knows that my mother loves his brother, he never says it openly but shows that he knows about it indirectly. My father even sometimes asks me whether my mother has any other email id apart from the one he knows and asks me the password of my mother's mail id. But my mother has warned me not to tell such things. My father's temper will rise when my uncle is at home and he will be angry with all of us. I have openly told my mother that such things are haram but she says that as far as she don't talk to him directly its all fine. She asks me and my sisters to translate the love quotes for her and we used to do that as she is our mother. she also ask our assistance to chat with my uncle.\r\n\r\nBecause of all this, my love towards my mother is decreasing day by day. I sometimes won't feel like listening to my mother even though my heart wants to obey her. Once, I told my mother that I want my parents to love each other and not any one else, I was crying as I could no more withstand this situation and there was an argument between me and my mother. My sister advised me not to express my views on this matter openly to my mother as it will hurt her feelings. She told me that, My mother had undergone alot of torture from my father and from his relatives (especially from the same uncle's wife). She loved my father so much but he didn't give her the same back, and even now, sometimes my father says some harsh words to my mother. she is very sensitive and all this may alter her state of consciousness , this love towards my uncle may be a relief for her from all this and will set her heart at peace.

Does my husband share any blame for this affair as he in a way created this situation?  Years later he discovered this affair through prolonged emotional and physical interrogation and pressure.  He justified all he did saying he \"had a right\" to find out about my unfaithfulness.  All I have researched since tells me that he had absolutely no right to dig up the past like this when he had no reason for suspicion or to think that this affair was continuing or would be repeated.","question_url":"\/en\/7650","question_no":"7650","status":"done"},{"id":"4102","category_id":"413","question":"Bus driver being alone with a woman.","question_full":"There are many women who attend courses in one of the centers for memorization of Qur&rsquo;aan, and there is a bus that picks them up and drops them off, and the driver has no mahram with him such as his wife.

I have read your previous replies about circumcision, from which I got my first\r\n      answer that circumcision is 'Sunnah' and not farz. On a medical point of view I know that\r\n      it is very hygienic if a person has circumcision and those without can experience\r\n      infections etc. in later life. But this cannot be used as justification because it can be\r\n      also argued that a persons appendices or toneless should be removed at birth because of\r\n      the chance of them causing a problem in later life.

When I Alhamdu lillah embraced Islam, I memorized Surah Al-Fatihah from a transliteration of the Arabic. This fall I began to study more about salah (prayer) and in a book of fiqh I read that if a person omits or mispronounces 1 letter or vowel of Al-Fatihah in salah, his recitation is invalid. When I read this I became so worried, because although I am studying Arabic, there are some Arabic letters I still cannot pronounce at all, and some I cannot pronounce well. I started to listen to a taped recitation of Al-Fatihah and I love to hear it recited, but I feel discouraged because my recitation is so poor compared to the Qari's. Since I read that ruling, I have become so nervous in my recitation of Al-Fatihah in salah that instead of focusing on the meaning, I think about how poor my pronunciation is. When I hear myself mispronouncing letters, I go back over the ayat, trying to correctly pronounce them again. But what happens is that I either make the same mistakes again or make new ones! Often I end up reciting Al-Fatihah more than once or a certain ayah more than once because I feel so worried that my prayers are not being accepted because I can't pronounce some of the letters. I have become so nervous that sometimes I even mispronounce letters I usually can pronounce during my recitation. What should I do?

After we got married, this continued for a while, then we decided to repent to Allaah and now, praise be to Allaah, we offer all the prayers regularly on time. What is worrying me and making me feel that this deed is not rewarded is the view of some scholars, such as Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen and Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on them) that the one who does not pray out of laziness or carelessness is a kaafir and apostate, and they quoted evidence for that from the Qur&rsquo;aan and Sunnah, even though there are scholars such as Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) who say that it is a lesser form of kufr. Even though I feel that this is the right opinion, I am afraid that I may be wrong, and I want to follow the view of Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen so that I can put an end to doubt, but this involves several things, some of which I can do and some I cannot.

This would be very difficult for my wife&rsquo;s father and he may reject this idea or remain angry about it for the rest of his life, so I can never renew the marriage contract and the problem will get worse and worse. Also I cannot be certain that the witnesses always prayed regularly from the time they reached puberty until now. If I follow the view of Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him), will I be regarded as falling short? Do I have to make up the missed prayers even though I do not know how many they are, or can I offer more Sunnah and naafil prayers? How should I make them up? Can I pray &lsquo;Asr for today, for example, then pray Fajr, Zuhr and &lsquo;Asr for the past days, or should I offer every obligatory prayer that I missed at the time of that prayer?

Nowadays, with the beginning of summer, we are faced with the problem of a long time between the beginning of the time for Maghrib and the beginning of the time for &lsquo;Isha&rsquo;. Every year there are arguments among the Muslims about what to do. Some mosques to pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; 90 minutes after the time for Maghrib begins, whilst others wait until the red afterglow disappears, for a period of up to 3 hours on occasion! Which causes hardship for people, especially as the night is so short. On days like this, the Muslims in the student halls of residence pray &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; in two congregations: the first group prays after 90 minutes, based on the following: (a) Shaykh Ibn &lsquo;Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in one of his khutbahs that the longest time between the beginning of Maghrib and &lsquo;Isha&rsquo; is one hour and thirty-two minutes; (b) based on a fatwa from one of the famous shaykhs in Saudi Arabia; (c) the red afterglow does not disappear all night in some regions and during some seasons of the year; (d) some mosques and Islamic centres rely on the 90-minute idea; (e) the Two Holy Sanctuaries (al-Haramain) follow this system. As for the other group, they pray later, based on the following: (a) the fatwa of the Standing Committee which says that each prayer should be offered at the time prescribed in sharee&lsquo;ah, in accordance with the signs described in sharee&lsquo;ah (if night is distinct from day); (b) a fatwa from another famous shaykh in Saudi Arabia, in which he affirmed that the 90-minute idea is based on mistaken ijtihaad; (c) some mosques and Islamic centres do that; (d) the timetable that is approved by the Muslim World League.

The soldiers at zero hour should take their positions according to the plan, whether on the ground or inside the military vehicles. After this no one is allowed to leave his position under any condition, just like a real war. During the operation we fire by real weapons like if we were in front of a real enemy. These operations sometimes take the time of one obligatory prayer or two, sometimes even more than this. The problem we face is that we cannot pray on time in congregation. For example, an operation starts at 11.00 until before sunset. This takes time for both Dhuhr and &lsquo;Asr, and no one is allowed to leave to pray every prayer on time. The question here is: is it permissible in this case to pray Dhuhr and &lsquo;Asr together?

My question is about Taraweeh Prayer in Ramadan. You have answered to me in a question before that Taraweeh should not be more that 11 rakat. It has been authentically reported that Muhammad SAAW prayed Taraweeh 3 times in Ramadan and it consisted 11 Rakah. Also the book by Shaykh Naasir-ud-Din Al-Albani (May Allah have mercy on him)&#1548; Qiyam and Taraweeh states that Taraweeh should be 11 Rakah. The sunnah is 11 Rakat. Now the question which is confusing and often becomes a discussion among brothers is whether the number of Rakat in Taraweeh should be 11 Rakat or 20 Rakat. Some people during Ramadan go to masjids where the Imam does 11 Rakats and other go to Masjids where the Imam does 20 Rakats. In most of the Hanafi Masjids around the US the Imam does 20 Rakat. The point to note is whether 20 Rakat or 11 Rakat the Imam completes the entire Qurran during Ramadan. The people are very sentitive about this issue and this issue becomes a topic in gathering in the United States. The people who pray 20 Rakat blame the other groug praying 11 as being wrong and the group praying 11 Rakat blames the group praying 20 as wrong. This is a big fitnah  in the US. This leads to disunity. People always quote that in Prophets Mosque the Imam prays 20 Rakats and also in Masjid-ul-Haraam in Mecca the Imam prays 20 Rakat. Also those who during Ramadan go to Saudi Arabia for Umrah say that the Imam prays 20 Rakat. This is a confusion. \r\n\r\nPlease answer and explain to me the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. The sunnah is to pray 11 Rakat then why is Prophets mosque in Medina and also in Masdid-ul-Haram the imam leads the people to pray 20 Rakat? Why? Why is this different from the sunnah?  \r\n\r\n2.
